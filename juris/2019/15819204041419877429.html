				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In forum 
shopping, what is critical is the vexation brought upon the courts and 
the litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same 
or related causes and grant the same or substantially the same reliefs 
and in the process creates the possibility of conflicting decisions 
being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues. Willful and 
deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping is a ground for 
summary dismissal of the case; it may also constitute direct contempt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b>
  </p><p> In May 2004, petitioner BF Citiland Corporation (BF Citiland) 
executed a Deed of Conveyance over its real property, covered by 
Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 218687, in favor of Banco 
Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank (Banco Filipino), as payment for 
subscription of shares of stocks amounting to P130 Million. Banco 
Filipino used the property as collateral to secure its Special Liquidity
 Facilities loan (SLF loan) from respondent Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas 
(BSP). However, the property's title was not yet transferred to Banco 
Filipino pending the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) 
approval of the investment and the BSP's favorable endorsement. Thus, 
Banco Filipino asked BF Citiland to execute a third-party mortgage in 
favor of BSP. On July 2, 2004, BF Citiland signed the mortgage. On July 
13, 2004, BF Citiland executed another deed of real estate mortgage over
 the same property as accommodation mortgagor to secure Banco Filipino's
 SLF loan from the BSP, this time amounting to P101 Million.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>
 In October 2004, BF Citiland learned that BSP disapproved the 
conveyance of the property in exchange for Banco Filipino stocks, so it 
rescinded the deed. Banco Filipino agreed because it was unable to 
deliver the equivalent value of the shares of stock.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p> On March 17, 2011, Banco Filipino was placed under receivership of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p> In 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 BSP filed a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate 
mortgage against BF Citiland covering TCT No. 218687. On October 25, 
2011, BF Citiland received a notice of sheriff's sale from the Clerk of 
Court and Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>
 On November 18, 2011, BF Citiland filed a petition for declaratory 
relief and prohibition with application for the issuance of writ of 
preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order docketed as <strong>Civil Case No. 11-1146</strong> (<b>declaratory relief case</b>) against BSP and the Makati RTC Clerk of Court and <em>Ex-Officio</em> Sheriff to determine BSP's right to foreclosure and to prevent them from conducting the public auction. It was raffled to <strong>Makati RTC, Branch 143</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  </p><p> On August 2, 2012, the Makati RTC Clerk of Court proceeded 
with the auction sale of the mortgaged property, in which BSP was the 
highest bidder at P273,054,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>
 On November 8, 2012, BF Citiland filed an action for annulment of 
mortgage and foreclosure sale with application for preliminary 
injunction/temporary restraining order docketed as <strong>Civil Case No. 12-1079</strong> (<b>annulment case</b>) against Banco Filipino, BSP, and the Makati RTC Clerk of Court and<em> Ex-Officio</em>
 Sheriff to annul the following: (1) the deeds of real estate mortgage; 
(2) the auction sale; (3) the certificate of sale; and (4) the 
annotation on Banco Filipino's certificate of title. It was raffled to <b>Makati RTC, Branch 141</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p><p> BSP filed individual motions to dismiss in the Makati RTC 
Branches 141 and 143 on the ground of forum shopping. Branch 141 denied 
the motion to dismiss in the annulment case on July 5, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and the motion for reconsideration on December 4, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The Makati RTC reasoned that there is no forum shopping since the issues between the two actions are different.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> However, Branch 143 ruled differently in the declaratory relief case. In its January 29, 2014 Order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 the Makati RTC, Branch 143 dismissed the petition for declaratory 
relief because BF Citiland committed forum shopping. BF Citiland did not
 move for reconsideration, which resulted in the order becoming final 
and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> BSP 
filed an omnibus motion before Branch 141 for the trial court to take 
judicial notice of the January 29, 2014 Order of Branch 143 and to 
dismiss the annulment case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On July 21, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 Branch 141 denied the omnibus motion because a similar motion to 
dismiss due to forum shopping had been previously filed, acted upon, and
 had attained finality. Branch 141 explained that even if it takes 
judicial notice of the dismissal of the case, this would not result to 
the dismissal of the annulment case as the court has expressly declared 
that dismissal shall only apply to the declaratory relief case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> BSP moved for reconsideration, which Branch 141 denied in its November 8, 2014 Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 Aggrieved, BSP filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the 
Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals (CA), docketed as CA-G.R. SP 
No. 138747.</p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Decision</b>
  </p><p> On October 9, 2015, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> granting the petition for <em>certiorari</em> and dismissed the annulment case.
  </p><p> The CA defined forum shopping as an act of a party, against 
whom an adverse judgment or order has been rendered in one forum, of 
seeking and possibly getting a favorable opinion in another forum, other
 than by appeal or special civil action for <em>certiorari</em>. It 
pertains to the institution of two or more actions or proceedings based 
on the same cause so that one or the other would make a favorable 
disposition. Here, the CA ruled that BF Citiland was securing an 
advantage by filing two identical cases consecutively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
  </p><p> The elements of forum shopping are: (1) the identity of 
parties or parties that represent the same interests in both actions; 
(2) the identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the relief 
being founded on the same facts; and (3) the identity of the two 
preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other 
action will amount to <em>res judicata</em> in the action under consideration, regardless of which party is successful.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
  </p><p> The CA explained that the true test in identity of causes of 
action is not in the form of action, but on whether the same evidence 
would support and establish both causes of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p>
 The CA resolved that there is identity of parties and of causes of 
action in the declaratory relief case and the annulment case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 The CA found no difference in both cases, because both were based on a 
single issue: whether or not the foreclosure of the real estate 
mortgages was proper while Banco Filipino is under receivership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 Even if BF Citiland added grounds to prove the nullity of the real 
estate mortgages, the same pieces of evidence were still required to 
prove its claim in either case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
  </p><p> The CA demonstrated the similarity of causes of action in a comparative table.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>

  <p>The CA elucidated on the nature of a petition for <em>certiorari</em> and the extent of grave abuse of discretion. A petition for<em> certiorari </em>is
 a remedy when any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or 
quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its 
jurisdiction, or with grave of abuse discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction. It is only available when there is no appeal, 
nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law. Grave abuse of 
discretion exists when the respondent acts in a capricious or whimsical 
manner in the exercise of its judgment as to be equivalent to lack of 
jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
  </p><p> Here, the CA determined that the Makati RTC, Branch 141 
committed grave abuse of discretion for failing to apply the rule 
against forum shopping despite knowing that BF Citiland had previously 
filed a case. When there is a finding of forum shopping, the penalty is 
dismissal of both cases as a punitive measure to those who trifle with 
the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p>
 The CA discussed the settled rule in forum shopping. If forum shopping 
is willful and deliberate, both or all actions shall be dismissed with 
prejudice; otherwise, it shall be dismissed without prejudice. Here, the
 CA dismissed the case without prejudice, because of the absence of 
willful and deliberate intent to violate the rule against forum shopping
 on the part of BF Citiland. It indicated in its Certification of 
Non-Forum Shopping in Civil Case No. 12-1079 that Civil Case No. 11-1146
 was pending. Furthermore, BSP was unable to substantiate that BF 
Citiland was in bad faith in committing forum shopping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> BF Citiland moved for reconsideration, which the CA denied in its May 26, 2016 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Unsuccessful, it filed before the Court a Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Presented</b>
  </p><p> The sole issue presented before the Court is whether or not BF Citiland committed forum shopping. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b>
  </p><p> The Petition is denied. </p><p> In its Petition, BF Citiland 
argued that the elements of forum shopping are absent, because: (1) 
there is lack of common cause of action since declaratory relief is a 
special civil action, while the annulment case is an ordinary civil 
action; and (2) there are no common rights asserted and reliefs prayed 
for since one action seeks a declaration on the right of the mortgagee 
to foreclose the property, while the other action aims to annul the 
deeds of mortgage, the auction sale, and the certificate of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>
 In its Comment, BSP raised technical issues in the Petition: (1) lack 
of competent evidence of identity in the Verification and Certification 
of Non­ Forum Shopping;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> 
and (2) failure to attach material portions of the record as stated in 
Section 4(d), Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, making the Petition 
dismissible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Respondent BSP also presented arguments on the correctness of the CA's ruling on the presence of forum shopping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p> In its Reply, BF Citiland did not tackle any of the technical issues and focused its discussion on the substantial issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>

  <p>In <i>Jorge v. Marcelo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
 the Court allowed the non-presentation to the notary public and 
non-indication in the verification and certification of non­ forum 
shopping of the affiant's competent evidence of identity, because he/she
 was personally known to the notary public, to wit: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> The fact that it contained no details of her competent evidence 
of identity is inconsequential simply because its presentation may be 
excused or dispensed with. If it is not required for the affiant to show
 competent evidence of identity in case he/she is personally known to 
the notary public, with more reason that it is unnecessary to state the 
details of such competent evidence of identity in the notarial 
certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Such is not the case here. The jurat of BF Citiland's Verification
 and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping does not mention that the 
affiants are personally known to the notary public. It clearly states 
that the affiants presented competent evidence of identity to the notary
 public and yet there were no entries under Identification and 
Date/Place of Issuance.

  <p>Proofs of competent evidence of identities are required to ensure 
that the allegations are true and correct and not a product of the 
imagination or a matter of speculation, and that the pleading is filed 
in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> With the absence of the details of competent evidence of identity, the verification and certification are defective. </p>
  <p> However, the Court had previously held that a defective 
verification and certification is not fatal to a case. In several cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 the Court entertained a petition despite a defect in the verification 
and certification, and reasoned that "the verification is only a formal,
 not a jurisdictional, requirement that the Court may waive." In these 
cases, the Court considered it more appropriate to resolve the action 
based on merit and substantive issues, and not on technical issues. </p><p>
 Here, the Court had examined the pleadings of the parties and resolved 
to deny the petition based on substantive and technical grounds. Form 
follows substance. The technical grounds play a secondary role in our 
ruling and are only additional reasons for the denial of the petition. 
Still, the Court reminds the members of the bar to conform to the formal
 requirements under the Rules of Court for the proper and efficient 
administration of justice.

 the Court held that non-compliance with Section 4, Rule 45 of the Rules

necessarily cause the outright dismissal of the petition. While Rule 45,
 Section 4 of the Rules of Court requires that the petition "be 
accompanied by [x x x] such material portions of the record as would 
support the petition," This Court may still give due course if there is 
substantial compliance with the Rules. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Here, BF Citiland attached the following documents: (1) certified 
true copies of the CA Decision and Resolution subject of this Petition; 
(2) complaint in the annulment case; (3) petition in the declaratory 
relief case; (4) January 29, 2014 Makati RTC, Branch 143 Order; (5) 
Omnibus Motion; (6) July 21, 2014 Makati RTC, Branch 141 Order; (7) 
November 8, 2014 Makati RTC, Branch 141 Order; and (8) BSP's petition 
for <em>certiorari</em> filed in the CA. 
  </p><p> The Court finds the above attachments as substantial 
compliance with Section 4(d), Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as it 
supports BF Citiland's position. BF Citiland attached copies of the 
assailed CA Decision and Resolution, as well as the RTC's orders and 
pleadings that are pertinent to its position. A petitioner is not 
required to attach all pleadings, court orders/processes, exhibits, or 
documents of the case, but only those which are material and relevant to

  <p>In <i>Malixi v. Baltazar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court discussed the concept of forum shopping: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Forum shopping is generally judicial. It exists: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> [x x x] [W]henever a party "repetitively avail[s] of <b>several
 	judicial 	remedies 	in 	different	courts, simultaneously or 
successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the
 same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially 
the same issues</b> either pending in, or already resolved adversely by,
 some other court." It has also been defined as "an act of a party 
against whom an adverse judgment has been rendered in one forum of 
seeking and possibly getting a favorable opinion in another forum, other
 than by appeal or the special civil action of <em>certiorari</em>, or 
the institution of two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the 
same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a 
favorable disposition." Considered a pernicious evil, it adversely 
affects the efficient administration of justice since it clogs the court
 dockets, unduly burdens the financial and human resources of the 
judiciary, and trifles with and mocks judicial processes. </p>
      <p> The test to determine whether or not forum shopping was committed was explained in<em> Dy, et al. v. Yu, et al</em>.:</p>
      <p> To determine whether a party violated the rule against forum 
shopping, the most important factor to ask is whether the element of<em> litis pendentia</em> is present, or whether a final judgment in one case will amount to<em> res judicata</em> in another. Otherwise stated, <strong>the
 test for determining forum shopping is whether in the two (or more) 
cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action,
 and reliefs sought. If a situation of<em> litis pendentia</em> or<em> res judicata</em>
 arises by virtue of a party's commencement of a judicial remedy 
identical to one which already exists (either pending or already 
resolved), then a forum shopping infraction is committed. </strong>(Citations omitted; emphases supplied) </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Here, the elements of forum shopping are present. </p><p> First, 
the petitioner/complainant in the declaratory relief case and the 
annulment case is the same, BF Citiland. There are common respondents in
 the two actions, BSP and the Makati RTC Clerk of Court and <i>Ex-Officio</i>
 Sheriff. The only difference is Banco Filipino, who was impleaded in 
the annulment case, but not in the declaratory relief case. However, 
even if Banco Filipino was not a party in the declaratory relief case, 
it still has an interest in its outcome because the foreclosure of the 
mortgages affects its SLF loan from BSP. With the identity of parties or
 interests in both cases, one of the elements of forum shopping is 
present. </p><p> Second, the declaratory relief case and the annulment 
case were filed after BSP foreclosed the mortgages on BF Citiland's 
property. The declaratory relief case assailed BSP's right to foreclose 
the mortgage while Banco Filipino was under receivership and sought to 
prevent the public auction. The annulment case aimed to nullify several 
documents and transactions, all related to the foreclosure of the 
mortgaged property. The first action was filed prior to the public 
auction, while the second action was filed thereafter. 
  </p><p> In short, the two actions have a common set of facts and 
transactions — the foreclosure of mortgages. Both were aimed to protect 
BF Citiland's right to retain title and ownership over the mortgaged 
property. Both actions asked the courts (Branch 141 and Branch 143) to 
stop and/or invalidate the foreclosure proceeding and its subsequent 
proceedings. Both were based on the same theory of the case — Banco 
Filipino cannot be forced to perform its principal loan obligation to 
BSP because of the prohibition to pay while it is 	under PDIC 
receivership. Consequently, the accessory mortgage obligation cannot be 
enforced as well. Given the prohibition to pay, Banco Filipino cannot be
 put in default, which is a requirement before the creditor-mortgagee, 
BSP can foreclose the mortgage. Without being in default, the right to 
foreclose does not arise. 
  </p><p> The Court observed that this theory of the case was found in 
the initiatory pleadings of both the declaratory relief case and the 
annulment case, and were lengthily discussed using the exactly same 
words.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This is a crystal clear indication that both actions were cut from the same stone, but were presented differently. </p><p>
 The Court finds that, although the terminologies of the two actions are
 dissimilar, they were rooted on the same theory of the case, protected 
the same right of BF Citiland, and pursued the same result. Thus, there 
is identity of right or cause of action and relief sought. </p><p> Lastly, would a resolution in either of the actions result to <em>litis pendentia</em> or <em>res judicata</em>? 
  </p><p> In <i>Goodland Co., Inc. v. Banco De Oro-Unibank, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court defined and enumerated the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> and<i> res judicata</i>: 
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> <i>Litis pendentia</i> is a ground for the dismissal of an 
action when there is another action pending between the same parties 
involving the same cause of action, thus, rendering the second action 
unnecessary and vexatious. It exists when the following requisites 
concur: </p>
    <ol><li>  	Identity of parties or of representation in both cases[;] </li><li> Identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for[;] </li><li> The relief must be founded on the same facts and the same basis[;] and </li><li> Identity in the two preceding particulars should be such that
 any judgment which may be rendered in the other action, will, 
regardless of which party is successful, amount to<em> res judicata </em>on the action under consideration. </li></ol>
    <p> <i>Res judicata</i>, on the other hand, exists if the following 
requisites concur: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) 
the judgment or order must be on the merits; (3) it must have been 
rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the 
parties; (4) there must be, between the first and the second action, 
identity of parties, of subject matter and cause of action. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The first three elements of<i> litis pendentia </i>are the same as
 forum shopping, and it was discussed in the preceding paragraphs as 
present in this case. The only question left for the Court to decide is 
whether a resolution in either the declaratory relief case or in the 
annulment case would result to either <i>litis pendentia </i>or <i>res judicata</i> on the remaining case. </p><p>
 The Court resolves in the affirmative. It was established that the two 
actions have identity of parties, identity of right or cause of action, 
and identity of reliefs sought. A decision on the merits in one action 
is, in theory, also a decision on the other remaining action. However, 
since the two actions were filed in two different courts/fora, the 
complainant/petitioner is considered to be shopping for a favorable 
result; hence, the term forum shopping. Having determined the presence 
of all the elements of forum shopping, we deny the petition. </p><p> <strong><b>WHEREFORE</b></strong>, premises considered, the petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>. The October 9, 2015 Decision and the May 26, 2016 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 138747 are<strong> AFFIRMED</strong>.
