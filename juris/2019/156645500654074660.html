The CTA's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 27, 2014, which denied the CIR's motion for reconsideration is likewise impugned herein. <p align="center"> <b>Factual Antecedents</b> </p><p> On April 17, 2006, PNB electronically filed its Annual Income Tax Return (ITR) for taxable year 2005.

Specifically, the CTA Third Division pointed out that the presentation of PNB's Annual ITR for 2006 is not enough to prove that it did not carry over the claimed excess or unutilized CWT to the subsequent quarters of 2006, ruling that the presentation of the succeeding Quarterly ITRs is vital to its claim for refund.

No pronouncement as to costs. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Undaunted, PNB filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated June 28, 2013. </p><p> On February 4, 2014, the CTA <em>En Banc</em> rendered the assailed Amended Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> granting PNB's motion for reconsideration. The CTA <em>En Banc</em> ruled that there is nothing in our tax laws that requires the presentation of the Quarterly ITRs for succeeding years to establish entitlement to the refund of excess or unutilized CWT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> Further, this time, the CTA <em>En Banc</em> recognized that the Supreme Court had, in several occasions, already passed upon this issue. It cited the cases of <em>Philam Asset Management, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <em>State Land Investment Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. PERF Realty Corporation</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> wherein this Court ruled that the presentation of ITRs for the succeeding taxable years is not an essential requisite in proving a claim for refund of excess or unutilized CWT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The Court elucidated that the presentation or non-presentation of the said document is not fatal to the refund claim as it is the duty of the CIR to verify whether or not the taxpayer carried over its excess CWT to the succeeding year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> The CTA <em>En Banc</em> also found that PNB complied with all the requisites for the filing of such claim. <em>First</em>, there is no dispute that PNB filed its claim within the two-year prescriptive period. <em>Second</em>, that the income related to the P74,026,451.67 CWT formed part of PNB's taxable income for the years 1999 to 2006 were evidenced by the documents presented by PNB, which were evaluated by the Independent Certified Public Accountant (ICPA), to wit: original accounting tickets or input sheets; original deeds of absolute/conditional sale; general ledgers for the years 1999 to 2006; audited financial statements; and ITRs for the years 1999 to 2006. <em>Third</em>, PNB presented Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source duly issued to it by various withholding agents for the year 2005, which were examined by the Court-commissioned ICPA, SGV &amp; Co., through its partner, Ms. Mary Ann C. Capuchino, to establish the fact of withholding. The ICPA noted, however, that out of the P74,598,430.47 CWT claimed for refund, only the amount of P74,026,451.67 was properly supported by original Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source issued in the name of PNB and dated within the calendar year 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> In all, the CTA held that PNB was able to sufficiently prove its claim for refund, albeit for the reduced amount of P74,026,451.67, disposing as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, [PNB's] Motion for Reconsideration (of the 05 June 2013 Decision) is hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong>. Accordingly, the Assailed Decision dated June 5, 2013 is hereby <strong>REVERSED</strong> and <strong>SET ASIDE</strong>. [The CIR] is <strong>ORDERED TO REFUND</strong>, or in the alternative, <strong>ISSUE A TAX CREDIT CERTIFICATE</strong> in favor of [PNB] in the amount of <strong>Seventy-Four Million Twenty-Six Thousand Four Hundred Fifty-One Pesos and 67/100 (P74,026,451.67)</strong>, representing excess and unutilized creditable withholding taxes for the taxable year 2005. </p> <p> <strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Insisting that the presentation of the Quarterly ITRs for the succeeding taxable year is incumbent upon claimants of CWT refund to prove its entitlement thereto, the CIR filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied by the CTA <em>En Banc</em> in its May 27, 2014 assailed Resolution:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, there being no new matters or issues advanced by [the CIR] in [its] Motion which may compel this Court to reverse, modify or amend the Amended Decision, the instant Motion for Reconsideration is hereby <strong>DENIED</strong> for lack of merit. </p> <p> <strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Hence, this petition. </p><p>In the main, the CIR maintains that the presentation of the Quarterly ITRs for 2006 is indispensable to PNB's refund claim to prove its entitlement thereto. The CIR argues in this wise: under Section 76 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), the taxpayer has the option to either carry over the excess CWT to the succeeding taxable quarters or to claim for a refund of, or tax credit for such excess amount paid; once the taxpayer opted for the carry over, the same shall be irrevocable and it will not be entitled to a refund anymore; the Quarterly ITRs would establish whether or not such carry over happened; hence, such Quarterly ITRs are indispensable for the refund claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> The CIR further argues that, assuming the presentation of the Quarterly ITRs is not necessary, PNB's claim for refund must still be denied because the Certificates of Creditable Taxes Withheld presented were not properly identified. Specifically, the CIR avers that the authenticity of such document should have been proved by identification of a person who saw the same executed or by evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> In fine, the CIR asserts that the PNB failed to discharge its burden to prove entitlement to the claimed refund. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue</b> </p><p> Ultimately, the issue here is whether or not the PNB proved its entitlement to the refund. Of crucial importance for the resolution thereof, however, is whether the presentation of the Quarterly ITRs of the succeeding quarters of a taxable year is indispensable for such claim. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The instant petition presents no novel issue. In the more recent case of <i>Winebrenner &amp; Iñigo Insurance Brokers, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> consistent with the settled jurisprudence on the matter, the Court specifically ruled that the presentation of the claimant's quarterly returns is not a requirement to prove entitlement to the refund. Notably, said case applies squarely to the instant petition and we find no good reason to deviate from its tenets as it remains to be a good law. </p><p> To be sure, this Court is not in disagreement with the CIR in recognizing that the burden of proof to establish entitlement to a refund is on the claimant. This is why in every case for such claims, the Court has always ruled that the claimant should positively show compliance with the statutory requirements provided under the NIRC and the relevant BIR rules and regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> We, however, cannot subscribe to the CIR's contention that the presentation of the Quarterly ITRs is indispensable to the claimant's case. </p><p> The CTA correctly ruled that there is nothing under the NIRC that requires the submission of the Quarterly ITRs of the succeeding taxable year in a claim for refund. Even the BIR's own regulations do not provide for such requirement. Section 76 of the NIRC provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 76. <i>Final Adjustment Return</i>. - Every corporation liable to tax under Section 27 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. </p> <p> If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable income of that year, the corporation shall either: </p> <blockquote> <p> (A) Pay the balance of tax still due; or</p> <p> (B) Carry-over the excess credit; or </p> <p>(C) Be credited or refunded with the excess amount paid, as the case may be. </p> </blockquote> <p> In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. </p> <p> Once the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor. </p> </blockquote> <p> Relatively, as implemented by the applicable rules and regulations, and as interpreted in a vast array of decisions, a taxpayer who seeks a refund of excess and unutilized CWT must: </p><blockquote> <p> 1) File the claim with the CIR within the two-year period from the date of payment of the tax; </p> <p> 2) Show on the return that the income received was declared as part of the gross income; and</p> <p> 3) Establish the fact of withholding by a copy of a statement duly issued by the payor to the payee showing the amount paid and the amount of tax withheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Verily, as consistently held by this Court, once the minimum statutory requirements have been complied with, the claimant should be considered to have successfully discharged its burden to prove its entitlement to the refund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> After the claimant has successfully established a <em>prima facie</em> right to the refund by complying with the requirements laid down by law, the burden is shifted to the opposing party,<em> i.e</em>., the BIR, to disprove such claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> To rule otherwise would be to unduly burden the claimant with additional requirements which has no statutory nor jurisprudential basis. </p><p> Thus, once the claimant has successfully established that its claim was filed within the two-year prescriptive period; that the income related to the claimed CWT formed part of the return during the taxable year when the refund is claimed for; and the fact of withholding of said taxes, it shall be deemed to be entitled to its claimed CWT refund. If the CIR, as the one mandated to examine and decide matters of taxes and refunds,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> finds otherwise, it is then incumbent upon it to prove the propriety of denying the claim before the court. Specifically, if the BIR asserts that the claimant is not entitled to the refund as the claimed CWT were already carried over to the succeeding taxable quarters, it is up to the BIR to prove such assertion. </p><p> In the case of <i>Republic v. Team Energy (Phils.) Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court even stressed on the fact that the BIR ought to have its own copies, originals at that, of the claimant's quarterly returns on file, on the basis of which it could have easily rebut the claim that the excess or unutilized CWT sought for refund were carried over to the immediately succeeding taxable quarters. The Court even went further to emphatically rule in the said case that the failure to present such document during the trial is fatal against the BIR's case rather than the claimant's. </p><p> It bears stressing that the power to decide matters concerning refunds of internal revenue taxes, among others, is vested in the CIR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It has the duty to ascertain the veracity of such claims and should not just wait and hope for the burden to fall on the claimant when the issue reaches the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. PERF Realty Corporation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court ruled that it is the duty of the CIR to verify whether or not the claimant had carried over its excess CWT. The CTA's jurisdiction is appellate, meaning it merely has the authority to review the CIR's decisions on such matters. In the exercise of its authority to review, the CTA cannot dictate what particular evidence the parties must present to prove their respective cases. The means of ascertainment of a fact is best left to the party that alleges the same. The court's power is limited only to the appreciation of that means pursuant to the prevailing rules of evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Thus, this Court finds no basis to rule for the indispensability presenting the Quarterly ITRs for a CWT refund or tax credit claim. </p><p> At this juncture, it is imperative to focus the disquisition on the fact that PNB proffered its Annual ITR for 2006 to prove that it did not carry over its 2005 CWT to 2006. This Court is confounded by the CIR's submission that said ITR is not enough to fully ascertain that there was no carry over. </p><p> In <i>Winebrenner</i>, the Court explained that an Annual ITR contains the total taxable income earned for the four quarters of the taxable year, as well as deductions and tax credits previously reported or carried over in the Quarterly ITRs for the subject period. The Annual ITR or Final Adjustment Return for the taxable year subsequent to the year when the CWT forms part, perforce, can sufficiently reveal whether a carry over to the succeeding quarters was made even if the claimant has previously chosen the option of refund of, or tax credit for the claimed CWT. The Court, in the said case, proceeded to explain in detail,<em> viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> If the excess tax credits of the preceding year were deducted, whether in whole or in part, from the estimated income tax liabilities of any of the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable year, the total amount of the tax credits deducted for the entire taxable year should appear in the Annual ITR under the item "Prior Year's Excess Credits." Otherwise, or if the tax credits were carried over to the succeeding quarters and the corporation did not report it in the annual ITR, there would be a discrepancy in the amounts of combined income and tax credits carried over for all quarters and the corporation would end up shouldering a bigger tax payable. <b>It must be remembered that taxes computed in the quarterly returns are mere estimates. It is the annual ITR which shows the aggregate amounts of income, deductions, and credits for all quarters of the taxable year. It is the final adjustment return which shows whether a corporation incurred a loss or gained a profit during the taxable quarter. Thus, the presentation of the annual ITR would suffice in proving that prior year's excess credits were not utilized for the taxable year in order to make a final determination of the total tax due.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, despite PNB's failure to present at the onset its Quarterly ITRs for 2006, its Annual ITR for 2006 is apt and sufficient to show that no CWT carry over was made in 2006. </p><p> Besides, even if a contrary ruling would be issued by this Court in the case at bar, PNB cannot be prejudiced for relying on the prevailing rule that presentation of succeeding ITRs is not necessary. It is noteworthy that PNB attempted to file its 2006 Quarterly ITRs through a Motion to Reopen (To Allow [PNB's] Additional Evidence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated March 16, 2010, which was actually granted by the CTA Third Division in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated May 5, 2010. Relying, however, upon <em>Philam</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and other pertinent jurisprudence also relied upon by the CTA <em>En Banc</em> in its assailed Amended Decision, PNB realized that the presentation of its 2006 Quarterly ITRs is not necessary. Hence, it filed a Motion to Withdraw<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> its previous motion to submit its 2006 Quarterly ITRs. Said withdrawal was also granted by the CTA Third Division in the same Resolution dated May 5, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p>Anent, the CIR's argument, questioning the authenticity and due execution of the Certificates of Creditable Taxes Withheld, the same should be given scant consideration. Foremost, said argument is belatedly raised before this Court. These documents were admitted at the initial stage of the proceedings before the CTA Third Division and records show that no such objection was made during the formal offer of said documents. Moreover, these Certificates of Final Tax Withheld, complete in relevant details, were declared under the penalty of perjury. As such, they may be taken at face value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p>Besides, resolving this issue would necessitate a re-examination of evidence on record, which is not within the purview of a review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Further, it is well settled that factual findings of the CTA when supported by substantial evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal. Due to the nature of its functions, the tax court dedicates itself to the study and consideration of tax problems and necessarily develops expertise thereon. Unless there has been an abuse of discretion on its part, the Court accords the highest respect to the factual findings of the CTA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> In all, having established that PNB complied with the minimum statutory requirements above-enumerated, and that the submission of its Quarterly ITRs are not indispensable to its claim, we find no reversible error on the part of the CTA <em>En Banc</em> in ruling that PNB is entitled to the claimed refund or tax credit. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the instant petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
