Tomas pocketed the cash bail of P2,000.00 that she gave to the latter to avoid arrest in connection with a criminal case against her for malicious mischief. Nonetheless, Benigno failed to appear and adduce evidence to substantiate her accusations.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Court directed the Executive Judge of the RTC of Biñan, Laguna to conduct an investigation on these administrative cases and to submit a report and recommendation.<br><br>In compliance with the Court's order, Judge Marino E.

Tomas is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of using, converting and manipulating judiciary funds and court records for his personal use and benefit, apart from his being guilty of dishonesty, gross neglect of his duties and responsibilities; thus, the extreme penalty of dismissal and loss of retirement benefits are strongly recommended.<br><br><center><b>The Report and Recommendation of the OCA</b><br></center><br>In its Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated November 24, 2009, the OCA finds the conclusion of fact and the recommendation of Judge Rubia to be fully supported by the evidence on record and adopts the same with an additional recommendation that Judge Galvez be sanctioned for her failure to resolve her cases and motions within the reglementary period. The OCA found Judge Galvez administratively liable for undue delay in rendering an order or decision because she did not refute the findings of the audit team regarding her non-action on numerous cases.<br><br>With regard to Sto. Tomas, the OCA sustained the findings of Judge Rubia since the investigation clearly established that he used, converted and manipulated the judiciary funds and court records of MTC, Cabuyao, Laguna.<br><br>On the basis of the foregoing findings, the OCA recommended, on November 24, 2009, that:<br><blockquote><ol><li>respondent Judge Zenaida L.

Tomas to prevent him from leaving the country, pending resolution of these administrative cases.<br><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>The sole issue presented for the Court's resolution is whether Judge Galvez and Sto. Tomas should be held administrativelv liable.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The Court agrees and adopts the findings and recommendation of the OCA.<br><br>The record shows that Sto. Tomas started as a clerk-stenographer of the MTC of Cabuyao, Laguna in 1965, and later became the Clerk of Court until the term of Judge Galvez who was appointed as Presiding Judge in 1996. Subsequently, Judge Galvez was designated as Acting Presiding Judge of the MTC of Biñan and Sta. Rosa, Laguna on August 1998 and October 1998, respectively. Given the situation, Sto. Tomas enjoyed the complete control and management of the business affairs of MTC, Cabuyao in his capacity as Clerk of Court and custodian of court records. He took advantage of the busy schedule of Judge Galvez and reveled in the unsuspected and complete trust and confidence of the latter.<br><br>There is no question with respect to the guilt of Sto. Tomas. It is apparent from the results of the audit that Sto. Tomas has a poor system of recording both the financial transactions and the case records of the court. The audit teams found that the records of cases were in complete disarray. There was no systematic filing in that cases of archive status were mixed up with cases already decided and dismissed. The audit teams also discovered the various shortages in remittances of funds in different periods, manipulations of entries in ledgers, mixing of receipts, loss of booklets of official receipts, and various irregularities in the handling of finances of the court including unauthorized issuance of provisional or handwritten receipts.<br><br>Clearly, Sto. Tomas had been careless and imprudent in discharging his duties. His failure to manage and properly document the cash collections allocated for the various court funds, as well as his action of misappropriating them for his personal use, demonstrated a serious corruption on his integrity. His cavalier attitude disregards the duty of every employee in the judiciary to obey the orders and processes of this Court without delay. He proved himself to be untrustworthy in every aspect of his task and responsibility.<br><br>In <i>Re: Report on the Financial Audit Conducted at the Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court stressed the vitality of the role and office of the Clerk of Court in the discharge by the judiciary of its primary responsibility in the administration of justice, to wit:<br><blockquote>Clerks of Court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties, and premises. As such, they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard, and physical plant manager thereof. It is the duty of the Clerks of Court to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities. They are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts. It is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds. Clerks of Court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice.<br></blockquote>As custodians of court funds and revenues, Clerks of Court have the duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories, for they are not supposed to keep funds in their custody. Such functions are highlighted by OCA Circular Nos. 50-95<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and 113-2004<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and Administrative Circular No. 35-2004 which mandate Clerks of Court to timely deposit judiciary collections as well as to submit monthly financial reports on the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, Administrative Circular No. 3-2000,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> commands that all fiduciary collections be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank. SC Circular No. 13-92 directs that all fiduciary collections be deposited immediately by the Clerk of Court concerned, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized depository bank, while SC Circular No. 5-93 provides that the Land Bank of the Philippines is designated as the authorized government depository.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>These SC Circulars are plain enough to command strict compliance to promote full accountability for government funds and no protestation of good faith can override such mandatory nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>To escape liability, Sto. Tomas tried to pass on the blame to Judge Galvez regarding the misappropriation of the court's funds contending that the latter took all the money for her personal use to construct her house and to purchase a new car. The records, however, contradict these allegations because it was established by the report of the audit teams that the mismanagement of court records and the embezzlement of the court's funds happened even before Judge Galvez was appointed as the presiding judge. Sto. Tomas had been pilfering from the coffers of the court for his personal use since 1985, and, fearful of being discovered, refused and failed to submit the financial reports despite repeated Court orders. His failure to submit the monthly financial reports despite several directives spawned suspicion on his wrongdoings — and there is no one but himself to blame. Verily, his grave misdemeanors justify his severance from service.<br><br>It is important to mention that the anomalies in the handling of cash collections and other judiciary funds discovered in the MTC of Cabuyao, Laguna did not exist at all in both the MTC of Santa Rosa and Biñan where Judge Galvez was concurrently the Acting Presiding Judge.<br><br>With regard to Judge Galvez, who failed to negate the findings regarding her inaction on numerous cases as listed by the audit team, the records are bereft of any showing that she requested for extensions of the period within which she can decide or resolve the aforesaid cases and incidents, or that she gave any credible explanation for the delay in their disposition. Hence, the OCA correctly found Judge Galvez administratively liable for undue delay in rendering a decision or order. Considering that Judge Galvez had already resigned from the judiciary in 2001, a fine of P20,000.00 is deemed to be reasonable.<br><br>As to Teñido and Manlegro, since they have already complied with the Court's resolution of paying the fine of P1,000.00, the case against them should be considered closed and terminated; and their withheld salaries and allowances should be released.<br><br>It is best to stress that dishonesty is a malevolent conduct that has no place in the judiciary. We have repeatedly warned that dishonesty, particularly that which amounts to malversation of public funds, will not be countenanced. Otherwise, courts of justice may come to be regarded as mere havens of thievery and corruption.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>This is the reason why the Court has emphasized countless times that all persons working in the judiciary, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, are tasked with a heavy burden of responsibility. Their conduct must at all times be characterized by propriety and decorum, and above all beyond suspicion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The Institution demands the best possible individuals in the service and it has never and will never tolerate nor condone any conduct which would violate the norms of public accountability, and diminish, or even tend to diminish, the faith of the people in the justice system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> For respondent's transgressions and numerous violations of the Court's administrative circulars, the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Courts and the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, the Court is left with no other recourse but to recommend his dismissal from the service, pursuant to Section 52, A(1)(3), Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Court finds as follows:<br><br>(1) MR.
