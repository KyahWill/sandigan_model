Santiago said that he ignored the man.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> Then, Santiago allegedly saw AAA approach David, though he did not hear what the two had talked about.

Definition of Terms. — As used in this Act:</p> <p> (a) Trafficking in Persons — refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.</p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>People v. Casio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> we enumerated the elements of the crime: </p> <blockquote> <p>The elements of trafficking in persons can be derived from its definition under Section 3 (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, thus:</p> <p> (1) The act of "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders." </p> <p>(2) The means used which include "threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another["]; and</p> <p> (3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes "exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> On February 6, 2013, the law was amended by Republic Act No. 10364.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <i>Casio</i>, likewise, enumerated the elements of the crime under the expanded definition: </p><blockquote> <p> Under Republic Act No. 10364, the elements of trafficking in persons have been expanded to include the following acts:</p> <p> (1)The act of "recruitment, <i>obtaining, hiring, providing, offering</i>, transportation, transfer, <i>maintaining</i>, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders[";]</p> <p> (2) The means used include "by means of threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person"[;]</p> <p> (3) The purpose of trafficking includes "the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the offense was committed on September 30, 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> prior to the amendment. Thus, the original provisions of Republic Act No. 9208 are applicable.</p><p> The Information charged petitioner with violation of Section 4(c), in relation to Section 6(c) of the law. Section 4(c) punishes the act of "[offering] or [contracting] marriage, real or simulated, for the purpose of acquiring, buying, offering, selling, or trading them to engage in prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor or slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage[.]"</p><p> However, a perusal of the allegations in the Information reveals that petitioner was sufficiently charged with the crime of trafficking in persons under Section 4(a). The provision does not allow any person: </p><blockquote> <p> (a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage. </p> </blockquote> <p> The trial court correctly convicted petitioner for violation of Section 4(a), instead of Section 4(c) of Republic Act No. 9208. The Information sufficiently averred that: (1) petitioner committed an act of qualified trafficking in persons by offering AAA to David for sex or exploitation; (2) the act was done for a fee; and (3) for prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude, or debt bondage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> The rule is settled that "what controls is not the designation of the offense but its description in the complaint or information[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p><i>People v.

It also discussed relevant jurisprudence: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court in <i>People v.

In <em>People v. </em><i>Spouses Ybañez, et al.</i>, this Court likewise affirmed the conviction of traffickers arrested based on a surveillance report on the prostitution of minors within the area. . . . <i>Casio</i> also recognizes that the crime is considered consummated even if no sexual intercourse had taken place since the mere transaction consummates the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the trafficked person, AAA, clearly recounted in her testimony how petitioner engaged her for the illicit transaction: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">Where were you on September 30, 2011 at around 1:30 in the morning? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I was going to Plaza Moriones to buy coffee. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And while you were going to Plaza Moriones to buy coffee, is there anything unusual that happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Can you tell us what was that unusual [thing] that happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">I was called [up] by Reynaldo Santiago, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And what happened after you were called by Reynaldo Santiago?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">There was someone asking in looking for a woman, Sir, and then I was called.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And what did you do after Reynaldo Santiago told you that someone was looking for a woman?

Neither is his identity relevant. "It is sufficient that the accused has lured, enticed[,] or engaged its victims or transported them for the established purpose of exploitation,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> which was sufficiently shown by the trafficked person's testimony alone. As explained by the Court of Appeals: </p> <blockquote> <p> Jurisprudence consistently holds that there are compelling considerations why confidential informants are usually not presented by the prosecution. One is the need to hide their identity and preserve their invaluable service to the police. Another is the necessity to protect them from being objects or targets of revenge by the criminals they implicate once they become known. The testimony of the confidential asset is not relevant for conviction nor is it indispensable for a successful prosecution of this case because his testimony would merely be corroborative and cumulative. The testimonies of the trafficked person, AAA, clearly narrating what transpired on the trafficking incident and the police officers regarding the entrapment operation were sufficient to prove appellant's guilt of the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, we affirm the lower courts' conviction of petitioner for violation of Republic Act No. 9208, Section 4(a), as punished under Section 10(a).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Moreover, since this Court cannot impose an indeterminate sentence due to the straight penalty imposed by law, the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of 20 years of imprisonment and the fine of P1,000,000.00. </p><p>However, damages in favor of AAA must be awarded. In <i>People v. Lalli</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> The Civil Code describes moral damages in Article 2217: </p> <blockquote> <p>Art. 2217. Moral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury. Though incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages may be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant's wrongful act for omission. </p> </blockquote> <p> Exemplary damages, on the other hand, are awarded in addition to the payment of moral damages, by way of example or correction for the public good, as stated in the Civil Code:</p> <blockquote> <p> Art. 2229. Exemplary or corrective damages are imposed, by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages.</p> <p> Art. 2230. In criminal offenses, exemplary damages as a part of the civil liability may be imposed when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances. Such damages are separate and distinct from fines and shall be paid to the offended party.</p> </blockquote> <p> The payment of P500,000 as moral damages and P100,000 as exemplary damages for the crime of Trafficking in Persons as a Prostitute finds basis in Article 2219 of the Civil Code, which states:</p> <blockquote> <p> Art. 2219. Moral damages may be recovered in the following and analogous cases:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;<br> (2) Quasi-delicts causing physical injuries; <br> (3) Seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts; <br> (4) Adultery or concubinage;<br> (5) Illegal or arbitrary detention or arrest; <br> (6) Illegal search;<br> (7) Libel, slander or any other form of defamation;<br> (8) Malicious prosecution; <br> (9) Acts mentioned in Article 309;<br> (10) Acts and actions referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35.</p> </blockquote> <p> The parents of the female seduced, abducted, raped, or abused, referred to in No. 3 of this article, may also recover moral damages.</p> <p> The spouse, descendants, ascendants, and brothers and sisters may bring the action mentioned in No. 9 of this article, in the order named.</p> </blockquote> <p> The criminal case of Trafficking in Persons as a Prostitute is an analogous case to the crimes of seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts. In fact, it is worse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, moral damages of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages of P100,000.00 are imposed, with interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
