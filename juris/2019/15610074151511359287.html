The project, with a contract duration of 12 months, is a 2.10[-]kilometer diversion road. Accordingly, the Notice to Proceed (NTP) was issued by [DPWH] to [RDC] on May 15, 1997.<br><br>x x x Thereafter, [RDC] mobilized its manpower, equipment and other resources necessary for the project and eventually, [RDC] actually commenced construction activities on May 24, 1997.<br><br><b>x x x However, the project was suspended effective June 4, 1997 due to [DPWH's] failure to secure the required Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) and to settle the attendant right of way (ROW) problems. The suspension lasted for almost 32 months or until February 8, 2001 when [RDC] was furnished by [DPWH] with the Resume Order.</b><br><br>x x x The project was finally accomplished and completed by [RDC] on September 6, 2001.<br><br>x x x Meanwhile, [RDC] made its claim upon [DPWH] for the idle time of equipment and other expenses incurred due to the suspension of work on the project in the amount of P93,782,093.64 pursuant to Clause 42.2 in relation to Clause 54.1 of the Conditions of Contract Volume III, Part I (FIDIC) x x x[.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x Essentially, the equipment rental component of the foregoing claim was based on the equipment guidebook published by the Association of Carriers and Equipment Lessors, Inc. [ACEL]. x x x<br><br>x x x Consequently, [DPWH] created an Ad Hoc Committee to evaluate the foregoing claim of [RDC]. <u><b>On September 1, 2003, the Ad Hoc Committee recommended payment of [RDC's] claim but only in the reduced amount of P26,142,577.09 and subject to the condition that [RDC] should waive or no longer claim the balance of its claim including damages.</b></u> The Ad Hoc Committee's recommendation was eventually approved by [DPWH's] then Acting Secretary Florante Soriquez.<br><br>x x x Notably, the computation for the idle time of equipment component in the above-mentioned recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee was based on [the lower bare rental rate submitted by RDC in its detailed unit price estimate which forms part of the parties' contract, and <i>not</i> the higher ACEL rates<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>].<br><br>x x x [RDC] was [purportedly] constrained to accept the [amount tendered by DPWH through a Letter dated November 14, 2006 (Letter-Waiver)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> because it was already in financial distress at that time and its financial condition was aggravated by the considerable length of time that elapsed since [RDC's] claim was made until [DPWH] finally decided to tender a substantially reduced settlement amount of its obligation to [RDC].<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [Subsequently], [RDC] made various representations and demands, both oral and written, upon [DPWH] for the payment of the balance of its entire claim, the final notice of claim having been served upon [DPWH] on January 14, 2008.

There is likewise no allegation on the part of RDC that it had been deprived of a fair and full opportunity to litigate the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 104920. That due process had been afforded both parties is evident from the CA 7<sup>th</sup> Division's Decision which exhaustively resolved the substantive issues in dispute:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [RDC] registered no objection to the payment of the reduced amount only to subsequently retract the waiver it earlier executed on the alleged ground that [DPWH] exerted undue influence over it.<br><br>Under Article 1337 of the New Civil Code, there is undue influence when a person takes improper advantage of his power over the will of another, depriving the latter of a reasonable freedom of choice. The following circumstances shall be considered: the confidential, family, spiritual and other relations between the parties, or the fact that the person alleged to have been unduly influenced was suffering from mental weakness, or was ignorant, or in financial distress.<br><br>[RDC] offered as evidence submitted with the Arbitral Tribunal of the CIAC financial statements pertaining to fiscal years 2004 to 2006 to prove its state of financial distress when it accepted [DPWH's] payment. [RDC] further claimed that by reason of its financial condition then and the fact that its money claims had been pending since 2001, just so it can collect, it was constrained to execute the waiver in November 14, 2006 as per [DWPH's] demand.<br><br>It is a jurisprudential doctrine that for undue influence to be present, the influence exerted must have so overpowered or subjugated the mind of a contracting party as to destroy the latter's free agency, making such party express the will of another rather than its own. The alleged lingering financial woes of a debtor <i>per se</i> cannot be equated with the presence of undue influence.<br><br>The concept is amplified by the renowned jurist, Arturo Tolentino who explained that <i>"undue influence is any means employed upon a party which, under the circumstances, he could not well resist, and which controlled his volition and induced him to give his consent to the contract, which otherwise he would not have entered into. It must, in some measure, destroy the free agency of a party and interfere with the exercise of that independent discretion which is necessary for determining the advantage or disadvantage of a proposed contract. In every such case, there is moral coercion. The moral coercion may be effected through threats, expressed or implied, or through harassing tactics."</i> x x x<br><br>It bears stressing that [RDC] is an independent contractor, which x x x had the capacity to engage [in] multi-million construction projects. It defies logic to believe that it agreed to execute the [Letter-Waiver] without knowing the consequences of its actions. It likewise does not inspire belief that [RDC] was morally coerced to execute the [Letter-Waiver].
