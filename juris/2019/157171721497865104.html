Under this approach, the value of the land is determined by taking the sum of the net present value (NPV) of the streams of income, in perpetuity, that will be forgone by the landowner due to the coverage of his landholding under the government's agrarian reform laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The operational assumption is that the agricultural properties to be valued are, in general, operating on a stabilized basis, or are expected to produce on a steady basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>While both DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998 and DAR AO No. 1, Series of 2010 commonly use a capitalization rate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of 12%, the NPV of the streams of income are computed using different values reckoned from different points in time. Thus, the use of the higher prices from a later time under DAR AO No. 1, Series of 2010 assumes that the property to be acquired is already operating at such capacity as of the earlier time of taking, and will continue operating at such capacity in perpetuity. <b>Hence, the <u>apparent purpose</u> of using the higher prices reckoned from the 12 month-period immediately preceding June 30, 2009 instead of the lower prices as of the time of taking is to address the issue of the variability of the value of the currency between the time of taking and the said period, and thus, to "update" the value of the property.</b><br><br>Nonetheless, it is well to point out that despite the use of current or updated prices, the just compensation remains unpaid as of June 30, 2009, while the landowners, herein respondents, have already been deprived of the use and benefit of their property with the issuance of CLTs and EPs in favor of the FBs. In <i>LBP v. Orilla</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Court elucidated the concept of just compensation, to wit:<br><blockquote>Constitutionally, "just compensation" is the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described as the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition, or the fair value of the property as between the one who receives and the one who desires to sell, it being fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government. Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. It has been repeatedly stressed by this Court that <b>the true measure is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to modify the meaning of the word "compensation" to convey the idea that the equivalent to be given for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is doctrinal that the concept of just compensation contemplates of <u>just and timely payment</u> (<b>prompt payment</b>). It embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the landowner, but also the payment of the land within a reasonable time from its taking, as otherwise compensation cannot be considered "just," for the owner is made to suffer the consequence of being immediately deprived of his land while being made to wait for years before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> <b>Verily, prompt payment encompasses the payment in full of the just compensation to the landholders as finally determined by the courts.</b> Thus, it cannot be said that there is already prompt payment of just compensation when there is none or only a partial payment thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Certainly, respondents' entitlement to prompt payment for the taking of their property cannot be disregarded by the mere absence of the CFs covering the same, as otherwise, the Court would be abetting the perpetration of a grave injustice against them, occasioned by the undue delay and unjustified failure of the DAR to forward to the LBP the said folders even after the taking of the subject land and the issuance of CLTs and EPs to the FBs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Consequently, the Court cannot subscribe to the LBP's argument that it shall only be liable to pay interest from the time that the RTC decision fixing the just compensation for the subject land becomes final.<br><br>However, the Court finds that it will not be fair and just to reckon the rate of imposable legal interest on the just compensation for the subject land (or any other property/ies valued under DAR AO No. 1, Series of 2010) from the time of taking since the land had been valued using <i>current prices</i> and had already considered income that the same would have earned and/or the variability of the value of the currency between the time of taking and June 30, 2009. Accordingly, interest on the unpaid balance of the just compensation is hereby imposed at the rate of 12% p.a. reckoned from June 30, 2009 up to June 30, 2013, and thereafter, at 6% p.a. until full payment, in line with the amendment introduced by BSP-MB Circular No. 799, Series of 2013.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision dated April 25, 2017 and the Resolution dated August 10, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 132400 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> imposing legal interest on the just compensation at 12% per annum reckoned from June 30, 2009 up to June 30, 2013, and thereafter, at 6% per annum until full payment.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, Senior Associate Justice, (Chairperson), Caguioa, J.
