				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The State's bounden duty to keep its people and those who sojourn within its territory safe from harm includes its obligation to protect their rights from any bureaucratic abuse. Striking a balance between utilizing sovereign police power and safeguarding mandated civil liberties has plagued adjudicators worldwide and has invited differing and sometimes divisive opinions. Nonetheless, courts are called upon to temper any philosophical debates and conflicting interests between law enforcement and protection of civil rights. This they can accomplish with lucid and objective decisions imbued with the wisdom of the Constitution and reflecting the majesty of the law and jurisprudence.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b></center><br><br>This is an appeal by accused-appellant Herofil N.

This had been duly corrected with the permission of the RTC to conform to the evidence presented during trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Accused-appellant's unsubstantiated defenses of denial, frame-up, and alibi are weak and have been invariably viewed by the courts with disfavor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Lastly, accused-appellant failed to present any ill motive on the part of the police officers who arrested him.

(emphases supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The first instance in Sec. 5 of Rule 113, on which the subject arrest was premised, is known as an <i>in flagrante delicto </i>arrest where the accused was <b>caught in the act </b>or <b>attempting to commit, </b>already committing or having committed an offense. For a warrantless arrest of <i>in flagrante delicto </i>to be effected, two elements must concur: (a) the person to be arrested must <b>execute </b>an <b>overt act </b>indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (b) such overt act is <b>done in the presence </b>or <b>within the view </b>of the arresting officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Failure to comply with the overt act test renders an <i>in flagrante delicto </i>arrest constitutionally infirm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The concept of <i><b>in flagrante delicto </b></i><b>arrests </b>should not be confused with <b>warrantless arrests based on probable cause </b>as contemplated in the second instance of Sec. 5 of Rule 113. In the latter type of warrantless arrest, an accused may be arrested when there is probable cause which is discernible by a peace officer or private person that an offense "has just been committed." Here, the offense had already been consummated but <b>not in the presence </b>of the peace officer or private person who, nevertheless, should have personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested had committed it. More importantly, there is durational immediacy between the offense that had just been committed and the peace officer or private person's perception or observation of the accused's presence at the incident or immediate vicinity. Such is why probable cause is required to justify a warrantless arrest in cases where the peace officer or private person <b>did not catch or witness </b>the accused <b>in the act of committing </b>an offense.<br><br>"Probable cause" (in the context of warrantless arrests) has been understood to mean <b>a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances </b>sufficiently strong to warrant a cautious man's belief that the person accused is guilty of the offense with which he is charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> While probable cause to justify a warrantless arrest is required only in instances where the peace officer or private person who was present only at the time when the offense was committed believes (based on his/her immediate perception) that an offense had just been committed, <u>some of its yardsticks for determination may be of help <b>in ascertaining whether </b>an accused is </u><i><u><b>attempting </b></u></i><u><b>to commit </b>an offense</u>. This is because the probable cause needed to justify a warrantless arrest ordinarily involves a certain degree of suspicion, in the absence of actual belief of the arresting officers, that the person to be arrested is <b>probably guilty </b>of committing the offense based on actual facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> And such determination of reasonable suspicion "must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances, PO2 Intud and PO2 Monilar had a reasonable suspicion to arrest accused-appellant who was seen to have drawn a gun as he was about to enter LBC. Common sense dictates that police officers need not wait for a serious crime, such as robbery, to be consummated before they move in and make the arrest because it will definitely endanger the lives and safety of the public, as well as their own. This is consistent with the jurisprudential <i>dictum </i>that the obligation to make an arrest by reason of a crime does not presuppose, as a necessary requisite for the fulfillment thereof, the indubitable existence of a crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Moreover, even if the firearm drawn turned out to be a replica, the police officers were not expected to know on sight whether the firearm was genuine or not, considering they had only a split second to act on any indication of danger. What was necessary was <b>the presence of reasonably sufficient ground to believe the existence of an act having the characteristics of a crime; </b>and that the same grounds exist to believe that the person sought to be detained participated in it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> As a result of the validity of the accused-appellant's warrantless arrest, the incidental search and seizure of the items in his possession is also valid "to protect the arresting officer from being harmed by the person arrested and to prevent the latter from destroying evidence within reach."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Additionally, accused-appellant's argument that the CCTV footage cannot be considered as a valid basis for his arrest fails to persuade. While it is a long-standing rule that reliable information alone (such as footage from a CCTV recording) is not sufficient to justify a warrantless arrest, the rule only requires that the accused perform some overt act that would indicate that he has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Therefore, it does not matter that accused-appellant was previously identified only from a CCTV footage supposedly covering his previous criminal conduct because <b>he was seen </b>by PO2 Intud and PO2 Monilar <b>performing an </b><i><b>overt act </b></i><b>of drawing a gun </b>as he was about to enter LBC.<br><br>Further, the assessment of the credibility of witnesses is within the province of the trial court by virtue of its unique position to observe the crucial and often incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment while testifying, something which is denied to the appellate court because of the nature and function of its office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> To be able to rebut a trial court's assessments and conclusions as to credibility, substantial reasons must be proffered by the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Relatedly, when it is decisive of the guilt or innocence of the accused, the issue of credibility is determined by the conformity of the conflicting claims and recollections of the witnesses to common experience and to the observation of mankind as probable under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Here, accused-appellant failed to rebut with affirmative evidence the testimonies of PO2 Intud and PO2 Monilar that he was caught in the act of drawing a gun as he was about to enter LBC. He never substantiated his claim, save for his self-serving account, that he was arrested without any reason. Moreover, the arresting officers' credibility was reinforced even more with their consistent corroborating statements under intense cross-examination.

Purportedly, this casts doubt on the source and negates the existence of the contraband. However, it is simply not enough to invalidate the amended information. A casual appreciation of the allegations in the original and amended informations immediately shows that accused-appellant had been carrying a hand grenade without a corresponding license; such effectively covering all the elements of the crime of illegal possession of an explosive device. It does not matter whether the model of the grenade's fuse assembly was inaccurately alleged in the original information. The same argument still supports the conclusion that the questioned amendment does not prejudice accused-appellant's rights; it does <i><b>not: </b></i>(a) charge another offense different or distinct from the charge of illegal possession of an explosive averred in the original information; (b) alter the prosecution's theory of the case that he was caught possessing a hand grenade without a license or permit so as to cause him surprise and affect the form of defense he has or will assume; (c) introduce new and material facts; and (d) add anything which was essential for conviction. In effect, <b>the assailed amendment which reflected the correct model of the subject hand grenade merely added precision to the factual allegations already contained in the original information. </b>Besides, a change of the subject marking from "M204<b>X</b>2" to "M204<b>A</b>2" is an obvious correction of <i>a clerical error</i>â€”one which is visible to the eye or <i>obvious to the understanding; </i>an error made by a clerk or a transcriber; or a <i>mistake in copying </i>or writing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> Accordingly, any amendment as to the discrepancy in the description of an element alleged in the information is evidentiary in nature and only amounts to a mere formal amendment.<br><br>Even assuming that the model number on the hand grenade is among the elements of illegal possession of explosives, it may still be amended under the circumstances <b>because accused-appellant was </b><i><b>still afforded due process when he was apprised </b></i><b>in the information </b><i><b>that he was being indicted for illegally possessing a hand grenade; </b></i>the model number, even the serial number, being immaterial. The allegations in the original and amended informations sufficiently cover the element of the contraband's existence as well as accused-appellant's lack of license to possess the same.<br><br>At this juncture, the Court stresses that the truth or falsity of the allegations in the information are threshed out during the trial. The matters contained in an information are allegations of ultimate facts which the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt to achieve a verdict of conviction. Conversely, an accused needs to rebut or at least equalize these matters by countervailing evidence in order to secure an acquittal. An accused cannot be allowed to seek an invalidation of the amended information, just because the information clarified one of the elements alleged inadvertently misstated by the prosecution in the original information. Hence, the RTC's act of permitting the amendment of the subject information, as affirmed by the CA, is permissible.<br><br><i><b>Admissibility of the Hand Grenade</b></i><br><br><b>I. Classifications of Object Evidence</b><br><br>Object evidence is classified into: (a) <b>actual, physical </b>or <b>"autoptic"</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><b> evidence: </b>those which have a direct relation or part in the fact or incident sought to be proven and those brought to the court for personal examination by the presiding magistrate; and (b) <b>demonstrative evidence: </b>those which <i>represent </i>the actual or physical object (or event in the case of pictures or videos) being offered to support or draw an inference or to aid in comprehending the verbal testimony of a witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Further, actual evidence is subdivided into three categories: (a) those that have readily identifiable marks <b>(unique objects); </b>(b) those that are made readily identifiable <b>(objects </b><i><b>made </b></i><b>unique) </b>and (c) those with no identifying marks <b>(non-unique objects).</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>During the initial stage of evidence gathering, the <i>only </i>readily available types of actual evidence reasonably obtainable by law enforcers are unique objects and non-unique objects. On one hand, unique objects either: (a) <i>already exhibit identifiable visual or physical peculiarities </i>such as a particular paint job or an accidental scratch, dent, cut, chip, disfigurement or stain; or (b) <i>have a readily distinguishable mark </i>such as a unit-specific serial number in case of an industrially manufactured item. On the other hand, non-unique objects such as narcotic substances, industrial chemicals, and body fluids cannot be distinguished and are not readily identifiable; that is why they present an inherent problem of fungibility<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> or substitutability and contamination which adversely affects their relevance or probative value. This is the reason why non-unique objects have to be made unique by law enforcers upon retrieval or confiscation in order for these articles to be authenticated by a sponsoring witness so that trial and reviewing courts can determine their relevance or probative value.<br><br><b>II. Authentication of Object Evidence</b><br><br>In its previous rulings, the Court had sought the guidance of U.S. courts in interpreting or explaining the rational basis underlying this jurisdiction's evidentiary principles. Some provisions of the Philippine Rules on Evidence <i>(Rules on Evidence) </i>were derived from or bear some semblance to some provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence <i>(Federal Rules). </i>In this regard, Rule 902(a) of the Federal Rules pertaining to authentication and identification provides:<br><br><blockquote>(a) In General. To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.</blockquote><br><br>Admittedly, the practice of testimonial sponsorship of object evidence in the Federal Rules is not specifically mentioned in the Rules on Evidence. Nothing in the Rules on Evidence deals with the authentication of object evidence during the trial. Apart from the requirement of formal offer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> however, such practice is part and parcel of having an object evidence admitted, because authenticity is an inherent attribute of relevanceâ€”a component of admissibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> The obvious reason is that an object offered in court as evidence but without having any part in the fact or event sought to be proven by the proponent is irrelevant because it has no "relation to the fact in issue as to induce a belief in its existence or nonexistence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>Relatedly, the Court promulgated the Judicial Affidavit Rule<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> which mandates parties to file, not later than five days before pre-trial or preliminary conference, judicial affidavits executed by their witnesses which shall take the place of their direct testimonies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> Here, parties seeking to offer documentary and/or object evidence are now required to describe, authenticate, and make the same evidence form part of the witness' judicial affidavit under the said Rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Therefore, as a rule, object evidence now requires authentication or testimonial sponsorship before it may be admitted or considered by the court.<br><br>Historically, the Court has applied the "chain of custody" rule as a mode of authenticating illegal drug substances in order to determine its admissibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> However, such rule has not yet been extended to other substances or objects for it is only a variation of the principle that real evidence must be authenticated prior to its admission into evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> At this point, it becomes necessary to point out that the <i>degree of fungibility </i>of <i>amorphous objects </i>without an inherent unique characteristic capable of scientific determination, <i>i.e., </i>DNA testing, is <i>higher </i>than stably structured objects or those which retain their form because the likelihood of tracing the former objects' source is more difficult, if not impossible. Narcotic substances, for example, are relatively easy to source because they are readily available in small quantities thereby allowing the buyer to obtain them at lower cost or minimal effort. It makes these substances highly susceptible to being used by corrupt law enforcers to plant evidence on the person of a hapless and innocent victim for the purpose of extortion. Such is the reason why narcotic substances should undergo the tedious process of being authenticated in accordance with the chain of custody rule.<br><br>In this regard, the Court emphasizes that if the proffered evidence is unique, readily identifiable, and relatively resistant to change, that foundation need only consist of testimony by a witness with knowledge that the evidence is what the proponent claims;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> otherwise, the chain of custody rule has to be resorted to and complied with by the proponent to satisfy the evidentiary requirement of relevancy. And at all times, the <i>source </i>of amorphous as well as firmly structured <b>objects </b>being offered as evidence <b>must be tethered to and supported by a testimony. </b>Here, the determination whether a proper foundation has been laid for the introduction of an exhibit into evidence refits within the discretion of the trial court; and a higher court reviews a lower court's authentication ruling in a deferential manner, testing only for mistake of law or a clear abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> In other words, the credibility of authenticating witnesses is for the trier of fact to determine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br><br>In the case at hand, the chain of custody rule does not apply to an undetonated grenade <i>(an object made unique), </i>for it is not amorphous and its form is relatively resistant to change. A witness of the prosecution need only identify the hand grenade, a structured object, based on personal knowledge that the same contraband or article is what it purports to beâ€”that it came from the person of accused-appellant. Even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that the chain of custody rule applies to dispel supposed doubts as to the grenade's existence and source, the integrity and evidentiary value of the explosive had been sufficiently established by the prosecution. As aptly observed by the CA:<br><br><blockquote>As previously stated, PO2 Intud, SPO2 Radaza and SPO2 Tingson positively testified as to the integrity and evidentiary value of the grenade presented in court, marked as Exhibit "B-1." PO2 Intud testified that it is the same grenade confiscated from the accused-appellant at the time of his arrest. SPO2 Radaza testified that it is the same grenade turned over [to] him by PO2 Intud. SPO2 Tiongson testified that it is the same grenade turned over to him by SPO2 Radaza. Thus, there is no break in the chain of custody of the grenade confiscated from the accused-appellant.<br><br>As to the absence of the marking "RMI2" which was placed by PO2 Intud on the grenade marked as Exhibit "B-l," the same does not affect the evidentiary value of said object evidence. Said marking was placed by PO2 Intud on the grenade before it was turned over to the PNP[-] EOD for examination, as shown by the Acknowledgement Receipt dated 23 July 2014 prepared by SPO2 Radaza and duly received by SPO2 Tingson. However, after the examination conducted by the PNP[-]EOD where it was determined that the grenade had "Safety Pull Ring, Safety Pin, Safety Lever intact and containing COMP B (Co[m]position B) as Explosive Filler," the masking tape containing the marking "RMI2" was apparently removed and/or "overlapped" with another masking tape. As such, the Certification dated 28 July 2014 issued by SPO2 Tingson of the EOD Team no longer reflected the "RMI2" marking on the grenade. In any event, what is crucial is the testimony of SPO2 Tingson that the grenade marked as Exhibit "B-l" is the same grenade turned over to him by SPO2 Radaza.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The above factual finding clearly shows that the source and existence of the subject grenade were authenticated by the prosecution's witness to be the very same explosive recovered from accused-appellant. SPO2 Radaza even testified that he saw PO2 Intud write his initials "RMI2" on the masking tape used to wrap the grenade and that the same initials were covered by another masking tape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> This makes accused-appellant's claim, that the apparent absence of the masking tape wrapping the hand grenade bearing the inscription "RMI2" makes "very doubtful" the <i>corpus delicti,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> an exercise in futility.<br><br>The Court also deems noteworthy that accused-appellant <b>never presented any evidence </b>which would effectively taint PO2 Intud's or any other prosecution witnesses' <b>credibility </b>with reasonable doubt. Bare and unsubstantiated allegations of ill motive or impropriety<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> have no probative value and cannot (and will not) take the place of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> In this instance, the presumption that the prosecution's witnesses have been regularly performing their official duty should be upheld absent any clear and convincing evidence of ill motive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br><center><b>Conclusion</b> </center><br><br>In fine, the Court finds no reversible error in the CA's decision because: (a) the warrantless arrest as well as the incidental search on the person of accused-appellant is valid; (b) the amendment of the original information seeking the correction of a clerical error regarding the model of the illegally possessed grenade is merely evidentiary in nature and is not substantial to cause the invalidation of an amended information; and (c) the prosecution's witnesses have sufficiently laid down the testimonial foundations supporting the existence and confirming the source of the confiscated hand grenade.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>in view of the foregoing, the Court <b>DISMISSES </b>the appeal of Herofil N.
