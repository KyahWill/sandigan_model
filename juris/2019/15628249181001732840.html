				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The jurisdiction over the administrative implementation of agrarian laws exclusively belongs to the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary.

Citing the 2003 Rules of Procedure for Agrarian Law Implementation Cases, it held that the Regional Director had primary jurisdiction over complaints for the cancellation of emancipation patents only if these were <i>not yet</i> registered with the Register of Deeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Since the emancipation patents had already been registered with the Register of Deeds of Leyte, jurisdiction over the Complaint properly belonged to the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Consequently, the appeal's jurisdiction lies with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> under the 2003 Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board Rules of Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In addition, the Court of Appeals held that the Heirs of Spouses Abucay were the proper parties to file the Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents. It explained that since Cabahug had not yet been fully paid just compensation for the property in 1983, she was still its owner when she sold it to Spouses Abucay. Moreover, Cabahug validly transferred her title to the property to Spouses Abucay which, upon their death, was later transferred to their children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Essentially agreeing with Regional Adjudicator Diloy's Decision, the Court of Appeals held that Cabahug was not afforded due process during the acquisition proceedings.

Respondents, the Heirs of Spouses Abucay, then filed a Joint Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> on the consolidated Petitions, after which only the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer filed a Reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Petitioners maintain that respondents' Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents is essentially an Operation Land Transfer protest that assails the coverage of the 22-hectare property under the Operation Land Transfer Program. The case, therefore, is an agrarian reform law implementation case under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Regional Director; the appellate jurisdiction, under the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary. Petitioners assert that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board correctly refused to take cognizance of the appeal and dismissed the Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further argue that respondents had no legal personality to file the Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents. Upon the effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 27, ownership of tenanted agricultural lands was automatically transferred to the farmer-beneficiaries. It follows that Cabahug had no authority to transfer the ownership of the 22-hectare parcel of land covered by Operation Land Transfer Program to the Spouses Abucay. Thus, respondents did not inherit the 22-hectare property from their parents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Petitioners further assail the Court of Appeals' finding that Cabahug was not accorded due process during the acquisition proceedings, arguing that she was properly notified of the coverage of the 22-hectare property.<br><br>The Deed of Absolute Sale executed between her and Spouses Abucay expressly provided that portions of the 182-hectare property being sold "appears to be within the coverage of Operation Land Transfer[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Further, petitioners claim that the Court of Appeals erred in finding that no just<br>compensation had been paid for the property, since a Certificate of Deposit worth P103,046.47 was deposited in cash and bonds in Cabahug's name on December 13, 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>For their part, respondents argue that the Petitions must be dismissed for being filed without authority. They contend that it is the Office of the Solicitor General, under Book IV, Title III, Chapter 12 of the Administrative Code of 1987,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which has the authority to represent before this Court the Department of Agrarian Reform Regional Director for Region VIII and the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer of Leyte.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>On the merits, respondents maintain that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board had jurisdiction over the Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents. Here, the emancipation patents issued to the farmer-beneficiaries have already been registered with the Register of Deeds. Citing Section 50 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law and the 2003 Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board Rules of Procedure, respondents point out that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board has primary and exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for cancellation of emancipation patents <i>registered</i> with the Land Registration Authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>According to respondents, petitioners in both cases, the Regional Director and the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer, are already estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of Regional Adjudicator Diloy and the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board as they failed to do so at the level of the Adjudicator or even on appeal before the Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Assuming that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board had no jurisdiction over the case, respondents argue that it should have instead referred the case to the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary under Rule I, Section 6 of the 2003 Rules for Agrarian Law Implementation Cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>On the issue of their legal personality to file the Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents, respondents maintain that they acquired a valid title to the 22-hectare property from their parents. In contrast, the property was not properly acquired through the Operation Land Transfer Program due to lack of notice and nonpayment of just compensation to Cabahug. Cabahug, then, had remained the owner of the property until she sold it to Spouses Abucay in 1983.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The issues for this Court's resolution are:<br><br>First, whether or not Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator Felixberto Diloy and the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board have jurisdiction over the Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents filed by respondents, the Heirs of Redemptor and Elisa Abucay;<br><br>Second, whether or not respondents had legal personality to file the Complaint before the Regional Adjudicator; and<br><br>Finally, whether or not the acquisition proceedings involving the 22-hectare property were void for lack of administrative due process.<br><br>The Petitions are granted.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>It is settled that the Regional Trial Courts, sitting as special agrarian courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> have original and exclusive jurisdiction over the determination of the value of just compensation. Nonetheless, the Department of Agrarian Reform still exercises primary jurisdiction to preliminarily determine this value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This is different from determining the validity of property transfer to the farmer-beneficiaries and, consequently, the validity of the certificates of title issued to them. When the issue in a case hinges on whether a beneficiary has made insufficient or no payments for the land awarded to him or her, primary administrative jurisdiction is under the Department of Agrarian Reform.<br><br>Indeed, per the rules it has promulgated, the Department of Agrarian Reform has taken cognizance of cases involving either the issuance or cancellation of certificates of land ownership award and emancipation patents. Cases involving registered certificates of land ownership awards, emancipation patents, and titles emanating from them are agrarian reform disputes, of which the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board takes cognizance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Meanwhile, cases involving unregistered ones are agrarian law implementation cases, put under the jurisdiction of the Regional Directors and the Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In 2009, however, Congress amended the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law through Republic Act No. 9700.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Under the new Section 24, all cases involving the cancellation of registered emancipation patents, certificates of land ownership awards, and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program are now within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> He or she takes jurisdiction over cases involving the cancellation of titles issued under any agrarian reform program, whether registered with the Land Registration Authority or not.<br><br>Here, the doctrine should be read amid the ambient facts and without prejudice to a future case that will deal with transfer certificates of title, considering the relevant statutes,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> as well as the equal protection<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and social justice provisions of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>At the time of the Complaint's filing on April 26, 2004, the 2003 Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board Rules of Procedure governed the jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board. Rule II provided that adjudicators have exclusive original jurisdiction over registered certificates of land ownership award and emancipation patents, while the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board has appellate jurisdiction:<br><blockquote><center><b>RULE II</b><br><i>Jurisdiction of the Board and its Adjudicators</i><br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Primary and Exclusive Original Jurisdiction</i>. -The Adjudicator shall have primary and exclusive original jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate the following cases:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>1.6 Those involving the correction, partition, cancellation, secondary and subsequent issuances of Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) and Emancipation Patents (EPs) which are registered with the Land Registration Authority[;]<br><br>. . . .<br><br>SECTION 2. Appellate Jurisdiction of the Board. - The Board shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review, reverse, modify, alter, or affirm resolutions, orders, and decisions of its Adjudicators.<br><br>No order of the Adjudicators on any issue, question, matter, or incident raised before them shall be elevated to the Board until the hearing shall have been terminated and the case decided on the merits.<br></blockquote>However, it is "not sufficient that the controversy [simply] involves the cancellation of a [certificate of land ownership award] already registered with the Land Registration Authority. What is of primordial consideration is the existence of an agrarian dispute between the parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Section 3(d) of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law defines agrarian dispute as those relating to tenurial arrangements, including leasehold and tenancy. Thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Definitions</i>. - For the purpose of this Act, unless the context indicates otherwise:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(d) Agrarian Dispute refers to any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farmworkers' associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.<br><br>It includes any controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under this Act and other terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowners to farmworkers, tenants and other agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of farm operator and beneficiary, landowner and tenant, or lessor and lessee.<br></blockquote>Indeed, the emancipation patents involved here have already been registered with the Land Registration Authority, and the grant of the Complaint filed by respondents will result in the cancellation of these registered emancipation patents. Nonetheless, respondents primarily assailed in their Complaint the land coverage under the Operation Land Transfer Program because the original owner, Cabahug, had not been properly notified of it. Specifically, they contended that the notices were erroneously sent to Cabahug's father, Sotero Cabahug. The Complaint, therefore, is essentially an Operation Land Transfer protest, which is an agrarian law implementation case belonging to the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary's jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Tenancy is a real right that is attached to the land and survives the sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As such, when Spouses Abucay purchased the land from Cabahug, they were subrogated to the rights and obligations of Cabahug as an agricultural landowner. Respondents, being the land buyers' heirs, were likewise subrogated to these rights and obligations. A tenancy relationship exists between respondents and the farmer-beneficiaries.<br><br>Still, the controversy must relate to the tenurial arrangement between the parties for the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board to properly take cognizance of the case. Here, the controversy does not involve negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange the tenurial arrangement's terms or conditions. Respondents alleged that emancipation patents should not have been issued to begin with since no notice of coverage was sent to Cabahug. In other words, they contend that the property was not properly acquired through the Operation Land Transfer Program. The controversy involves the administrative implementation of the agrarian reform program, which, as mentioned, is under the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary's jurisdiction.<br><br>Since the Complaint filed by respondents involves an agrarian law implementation case, Regional Adjudicator Diloy had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of it. At that time, he should have referred the case to the proper office of the Department of Agrarian Reform for appropriate action as provided in Rule I, Section 6 of the Department of Agrarian Reform Administrative Order 03-03.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>However, with the enactment of Republic Act No. 9700, the exclusive and original jurisdiction over cases for cancellation of registered emancipation patents now belongs to the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In line with this, the Department of Agrarian Reform has issued Administrative Order No. 07-14, which outlines in Article III the procedure for the cancellation of registered emancipation patents, certificates of land ownership awards, and other agrarian titles. The petition for cancellation shall be filed before the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator, which would then undertake the case buildup before forwarding it to the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary for decision.<br><br>Thus, under Administrative Order No. 07-14, the Complaint for cancellation of original certificates of title and emancipation patents filed by respondents should be referred to the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator of Leyte for case buildup.

With the passage on August 7, 2009 of RA 9700,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> further amending RA 6657, as amended, <u>cases involving cancellation of <b><i>registered</i></b> EPs, CLOAs, and other agrarian titles, whether raised in an <b>ALI</b> or an <b>ARD</b> case, are now within the <b>exclusive and original jurisdiction</b> of the DAR Secretary</u>. Section 24 of RA 6657, as amended by RA 9700, pertinently provides:<br><blockquote>Section 24. <i>Award to Beneficiaries</i>. - The rights and responsibilities of the beneficiaries shall commence from their receipt of a duly registered emancipation patent or certificate of land ownership award and their actual physical possession of the awarded land. Such award shall be completed in not more than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of registration of the title in the name of the Republic of the Philippines: <i>Provided</i>, That the emancipation patents, the certificates of land ownership award, and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program shall be indefeasible and imprescriptible after one (1) year from its registration with the Office of the Registry of Deeds, subject to the conditions, limitations and qualifications of this Act, the property registration decree, and other pertinent laws.

The herein <i>cancellation case</i> is essentially an OLT protest, which is an agrarian law implementation (ALI) case, and there exists no agrarian dispute (ARD) nor an agrarian reform matter so as to situate the jurisdiction thereon with the DARAB (particularly, the RARAD).
