Case Nos. 118-V-16 and 119-V-16 finding accused-appellant Xandra Santos <i>y</i> Littaua (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<p align="center"><b>The Facts</b></p><p>This case stemmed from two (2) Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed before the RTC charging accused-appellant with the crimes of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution alleged that at around 6:30 in the evening of January 16, 2016, acting on the information received from a confidential informant, operatives from the Station Anti-Illegal Drug - Special Operation Task Group of the Valenzuela City Police successfully conducted a buy-bust operation against accused-appellant along Bisig Street, Valenzuela City, during which one (1) plastic sachet containing 0.20 gram of white crystalline substance was recovered from her. When accused-appellant was searched after her arrest, police officers found one (1) more plastic sachet containing 0.10 gram of the same substance from her possession. As noisy people started to crowd the place of arrest, officers immediately brought accused-appellant back to the police station where they marked, inventoried,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and photographed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the seized items in her presence as well as that of Kagawad Roberto Dawat (Kgd.

In this regard, case law recognizes that "[m]arking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p>The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u></i> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the NPS<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i><u>OR</u></i> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p>As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been 'crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p>Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<i>a</i>) there is a justifiable ground for non-­compliance; and (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <b>It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p>Anent the witness requirement, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted <b>genuine and sufficient efforts</b> to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was <b>reasonable</b> under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <b><u>Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p>Notably the Court in <i>People v. Lim</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> explained that the absence of the required witnesses must be justified based on acceptable reasons such as: "(1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ [and] media representative[s] and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p>Moreover, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, then the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <i>a quo</i>; otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p>In this case, the arresting officers' acts of performing the marking, inventory, and photography of the seized items not at the place of arrest but at the police station were justified as a crowd was already forming at the place of arrest. This notwithstanding, the Court observes that there was still a deviation from the witness requirement as the conduct of inventory and photography was not witnessed by a representative from the NPS or the media. This may be easily gleaned from the Inventory of Seized Properties/Items<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> which only confirms the presence of an elected public official, <i>i.e.</i>, Kgd. Dawat. Markedly, such finding was also admitted by the poseur-buyer, Police Officer 3 Allan T. Vizconde (PO3 Vizconde), on direct and cross-examination, who explained that despite their efforts at contacting representatives from the DOJ and the media, no one was available, so they decided to proceed with the conduct of inventory and photography without their presence, to wit:</p><p align="center"><b>Direct Examination</b></p><blockquote><p>[Fiscal Benedict Sta. Cruz]: There appears to be no representative from the Media and DOJ, could you tell us why?<br> [PO3 Vizconde]: Our chief called and after an hour, they told us that there is <b><u>no available</u></b> representatives, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p></blockquote><p align="center"><b>Cross-Examination</b></p><blockquote><p>[Atty. Abraham Alipio]: During the inventory, who were then present?<br> [PO3 Vizconde]: PCI Ruba, Kgd. Dawat and other police officers.</p></blockquote><p align="center">x x x x</p><blockquote><p>Q: Isn't it a fact that no representative from the media was present?<br> A: Our chief was calling for a representative from the media but until the kagawad arrived[,] there was <b>no representative from the media</b>, so we decided to conduct drug inventory.</p><p>Q: How about the representative from the DOJ?<br> A: None. They were calling but <b>no one is answering</b>.</p><p>Q: Did they inform you who were the persons they were trying to call?<br> A: Major Ruba was not able to tell us.</p><p>Q: According to you, this is a planned operation?<br> A: Yes, sir.</p><p>Q: Considering that it was a planned operation, why did you not secure a representative from [the] DOJ and Media before you conduct[ed] the operation?<br> A: What I know is that Major Ruba has already talked to those persons but during the conduct of inventory <b>no one arrived</b>.</p><p>Q: Did you not try to call any other person?<br> A: It was Major Ruba who was in charged (sic).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The Court, however, finds such explanation untenable.</p><p>The sheer statement of PO3 Vizconde that representatives from the DOJ and the media had been contacted but were simply unavailable, without more, cannot be deemed reasonable enough to justify a deviation from the mandatory directives of the law. Indeed, as earlier stated, mere claims of unavailability, absent a showing that actual and serious attempts were employed to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as they fail to show that genuine and sufficient efforts were exerted by police officers. In view of the foregoing, the Court is impelled to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from accused-­appellant, which constitute the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crimes charged, have been compromised;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> hence, her acquittal is perforce in order.</p><p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
