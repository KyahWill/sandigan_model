In turn, WERFAST agreed to donate equipment for the establishment of an online system for such applications. The agreement was for a period of five (5) years, renewable for another (5) years. Said MOA was notarized only on September 13, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On May 31, 2011, Estilles issued Letter Order No. 0:531-40-11, creating a Teclmical Working Group (<i>TWG</i>) that would study the proposal of WERFAST.

Ricafranca alleged that there were "highly controversial arrangements in favor of WERFAST," such as: (1) the mandatory nature of the courier service provided; (2) WERFAST had not yet been incorporated at the time MOA No. 05-2011 was executed; (3) there was no authority from the Department of Transportation and Communications to deliver mails and parcels to the public; and (4) Purisima's personal ties with WERFAST's incorporators and officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>On October 9, 2014, the FFIB-MOLEO also filed administrative complaints against respondent and several other PNP officials before petitioner for <i>Grave Abuse of Authority, Grave Misconduct</i>, and <i>Serious Dishonesty</i>. The case was docketed as OMB-P-A-14-0659. The FFIBÂ­ MOLEO chiefly alleged that the PNP officials involved failed to properly evaluate the qualification and capabilities of WERFAST to engage in courier service.

In the case of respondent, his defense was anchored mainly on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty. He pointed out that he was designated as Chief of FEO on May 11, 2012 and, hence, he had no participation in MOA No. 05-2011 executed between Estilles and WERFAST. Furthermore, he contended that he acted with due diligence as Chief of FEO when he took immediate steps to address the complaints against WERFAST. He insisted that the FEO-CSAB could have revoked WERFAST's accreditation, only if its members were not relieved from their respective posts.<br><br>In its Consolidated Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated June 25, 2015, petitioner found respondent, together with the other police officials, guilty of <i>Grave Abuse of Authority, Grave Misconduct</i>, and <i>Serious Dishonesty</i>.<br><br>Aggrieved, respondent filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On April 19, 2016, the Court of Appeals granted respondent's Petition for Review through the assailed Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby GRANTED.

The Resolution dated August 4, 2016, denying the motion for reconsideration, was received by the petitioner on August 15, 2016.<br><br>Pursuant to Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, petitioner has 60 days from August 15, 2016 to file a petition for <i>certiorari</i>. Hence, the instant Petition was filed within the said period, on October 14, 2016.<br><br>An essential requisite for filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is the allegation that the judicial tribunal acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as a "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment that is patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The writ of <i>certiorari</i> is not issued to correct every error that may have been committed by lower courts and tribunals. It is a remedy specifically to keep lower com1s and tribunals within the bounds of their jurisdiction. In our judicial system, the writ is issued to prevent lower courts and tribunals from committing grave abuse of discretion in excess of their jurisdiction. Further, the writ requires that there is no appeal or other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to correct the error. Thus, <i>certiorari</i> may not be issued if the error can be the subject of an ordinary appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>We find that petitioner was correct in seeking its remedy under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In <i>Office of the Ombudsman v.

Pursuant to such constitutional authority, Administrative Order No. 07 (otherwise known as the "Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman"), dated April 10, 1990, was issued. Section 7, Rule III thereof provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. Finality of decision. - Where the respondent is absolved of the charge and in case of conviction where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one (1) month, or a fine equivalent to one (1) month salary, the decision shall be final and unappealable. In all other cases, the decision shall become final after the expiration of ten (10) days from receipt thereof by the respondent, unless a motion for reconsideration or petition for ce11iorari shall have been filed by him as prescribed in Section 27 of RA 6770.</blockquote>The Court, in interpreting the above constitutional and statutory provisions, recognizes only two instances where a decision of the Ombudsman is considered as <b>final and unappealable</b> and, thus, immediately executory. The first is when the respondent is <b>absolved of the charge</b>; and the second is, in case of conviction, where the penalty imposed is public censure or reprimand, suspension of not more than one month, or a fine equivalent to one month salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondent was absolved by the Court of Appeals when it issued the assailed Decision and Resolution. Accordingly, the assailed Decision and Resolution are final, unappealable and immediately executory. Likewise, petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Thus, the remedy under Rule 65 is availing.<br><br>Anent substantive issues, we shall discuss these jointly.<br><br>In its Decision, the Court of Appeals held that there is no substantial evidence to hold respondent guilty on the ground that the totality of the evidence adduced showed that, aside from respondent's role as Chairman of both the TWG and FEO-CSAB, there is nothing on record showing his actual or direct participation in the purported plan to solely accredit WERFAST.<br><br>It held that petitioner failed to point out the particular acts committed by respondent as chairman of the TWG that would indicate that he acted in unison with other PNP ot1icials to solely accredit WERFAST as provider of courier service. It found that despite pressure and coercion from Purisima, respondent and the other members of FEO-CSAB actually ruled against the exclusive and mandatory nature of the courier service provider.<br><br>The Court of Appeals likewise held that WERFAST was qualified as a courier service provider because it substantially complied with the requirements under Section 5 of the Policy on Accreditation. Moreover, the accreditation granted to WERFAST was only interim since only a one-year period was given, instead of two years as provided under the Procedure for Accreditation. Thus, it was erroneous on the part of petitioner to conclude that the accreditation of WERFAST was unqualified and not interim.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also held that the absence of a public bidding does not prove that respondent had a conscious and malicious design to conspire and give unwarranted benefit to WERFAST. It ratiocinated that since WERFAST does not claim for exclusivity and provided that it undergoes the process of accreditation, public bidding is not required.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>It is well-settled that findings of fact by petitioner are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Its factual findings are generally accorded great weight and respect, if not finality by the courts, by reason of its special knowledge and expertise over matters falling under its jurisdiction.<br><br>This rule was reiterated in <i>Cabalit v. Commission on Audit-Region VII</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> where we held that when the findings of fact of petitioner are supported by substantial evidence, they should be considered as conclusive. This Court recognizes the expertise and independence of petitioner and will avoid interfering with its findings absent a finding of grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>This rule on conclusiveness of factual findings, however, is not an absolute one. Despite the respect given to administrative findings of fact, the Court of Appeals may resolve factual issues, review and re-evaluate the evidence on record, and reverse the administrative agency's findings if not supported by substantial evidence. Thus, when the findings of fact by the administrative or quasi-judicial agencies (like petitioner/Deputy Ombudsman) are not adequately supported by substantial evidence, they shall not be binding upon the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In administrative cases, substantial evidence is required to support any findings. Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The requirement is satisfied where there is reasonable ground to believe that the petitioner is guilty of the act or omission complained of, even if the evidence might not be overwhelming.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the factual findings of petitioner were supported by substantial evidence. Our examination of the records tells us that petitioner's findings and appreciation of the presented evidence are more in accord with reason and common experience so that it successfully proved, by the required quantum of evidence, respondent's liability.<br><br>Conspiracy is said to exist where two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. The essence of conspiracy is the unity of action and purpose. Its elements, like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Direct proof is not essential to prove conspiracy for it may be deduced from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime charged, from which it may be indicated that there is a common purpose to commit the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>To be a conspirator, one need not participate in every detail of the execution; he need not even take part in every act. Each conspirator may be assigned separate and different tasks which may appear unrelated to one another but, in fact, constitute a whole collective effort to achieve their common criminal objective. Once conspiracy is shown, the act of one is the act of all the conspirators. The precise extent or modality of participation of each of them becomes secondary, since all the conspirators are principals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Here, as aptly ruled by petitioner, respondent cooperated by signing the TWG Memorandum dated June 30, 2011 and FEO-CSAB Resolution No. 2013-027. In signing these documents, he paved the way for the accreditation of WERFAST and, eventually, as the sole courier service provider of firearms licenses.<br><br>As chairman of the TWG, respondent favorably recommended the proposal of WERFAST despite its lack of juridical personality and the absence of the requisite public bidding. On the other hand, as chairman of FEO-CSAB, respondent accredited WERFAST despite the latter's non-submission of the other documents required under the PNP's Policy on Accreditation.<br><br>Contrary to the findings of the Court of Appeals, it is evident that WERFAST did not substantially comply with the requirements under Section 5 of the Policy on Accreditation.<br><br><i>First</i>, there is no showing that WERFAST submitted any reportorial requirement to the SEC.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the local government unit permit that was submitted by WERFAST indicates that its principal office is located in Quezon City. However, the DTI Certificate of Business Registration dated December 6, 2010, MOA No. 05-2011, and its letter dated September 14, 2012 indicate that WERFAST's principal office is located at Room 312, Burke Bldg., Burke St., Escolta, Manila.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the BIR clearance that was submitted by WERFAST only pertains to a Certificate of Registration. This only certifies that it is a company registered with the BIR. Nowhere in the said Certificate will show that WERFAST has paid all its income taxes for the year. Further, the same Certificate shows that WERFAST's primary purpose is business consultancy. Nowhere in said Certificate states that WERFAST is engaged in the business of courier service.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, the company profile that was submitted by WERFAST refers to Philrem, another corporation having a separate and distinct juridical personality from WERFAST. In fact, it was later on discovered that during the implementation of MOA No. 05-2011, WERFAST turned to LBC, and not to Philrem, to fulfill its obligation. This is contrary to the claim of WERFAST that it is a subsidiary of Philrem which has an extensive experience in the delivery of foreign and local currencies (remittances) to a nationwide clientele.<br><br>It was noteworthy that WERFAST had no corporate existence at the time the TWG issued the Memorandum dated June 30, 2011, favorably recommending the proposal of WERFAST; its Certificate of Registration having been issued only on August 10, 2011.<br><br><i>Lastly</i>, it was not shown that when Valerio submitted his September 14, 2012 application letter he was duly authorized by the Board of Directors of WERFAST.<br><br>These discrepancies should have immediately raised doubts on the part of the TWG and FEO-CSAB, and caused them to further verify the veracity of these documents. Thus, WERFAST cannot be said to have substantially complied with the requirements under Section 5 of the Policy on Accreditation.<br><br>Moreover, had respondent heeded and followed the requirements under Section 5 of the Policy on Accreditation issued by Meneses, respondent would not have found himself in this administrative predicament. Having disregarded the said policy, respondent cannot now invoke the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty because this presumption can only apply where the one claiming it had regularly performed his duty. By disregarding the said policy, respondent could not be said to have performed his duties in a regular manner.<br><br>The Court of Appeals likewise committed grave abuse of discretion when it held that the accreditation granted to WERFAST was only interim.<br><br>While Section 6.4 of the Policy on Accreditation allows the grant of interim accreditation when the applicant lacks requirements provided under Section 5 thereof - and only in exceptional cases - there is nothing in Resolution No. 2013-027 that grants WERFAST an "interim accreditation." Neither was there a statement that WERFAST lacks any of the requirements under Section 5 of the Policy on Accreditation. Hence, the accreditation of WERFAST was unqualified.<br><br>We cannot likewise fathom the pronouncement of the Court of Appeals that public bidding is not required since WERFAST does not claim for exclusivity and provided that it undergoes the process of accreditation. This has no basis in law and jurisprudence.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act explicitly provides that, as a rule, all procurement shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided for in Article XVI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Sections 4 and 10 of Republic Act No. 9184 read:<br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Scope and Application</i>.- This act shall apply to the Procurement of Infrastructure Projects, Goods and Consulting Services, regardless of source of funds, whether local <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[or]</sup> foreign, by <u><b>all</b></u> branches and instrumentalities of government, its departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or-controlled corporations and local government units, subject to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 138. Any treaty or international or executive agreement affecting the matter of this Act to which the Philippine government is signatory shall be observed.<br><br>Section 10. Competitive Bidding.- <u><b>All</b></u> Procurement shall be done through Competitive Bidding, except as provided for in Article XVI of this Act. (Emphases supplied.)</blockquote>One of the primary and basic rules in statutory construction is that where the words of a statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>It is clear from the provisions of Republic Act No. 9184 that <u><b>ALL</b> procurement</u> by <u><b>ALL</b> branches and instrumentalities of government</u>, their departments, offices and agencies, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations and local government units shall be done through competitive bidding, except as provided for in Article XVI. The procurement by the PNP of the courier service for the firearms licenses is not among those provided under Article XVI. Thus, public bidding is required.<br><br>The fact that WERFAST does not claim for exclusivity and will undergo the accreditation process is of no moment. There is nothing on record that would justify the exemption of the subject procurement from the general rule on public bidding.<br><br>Finally, there is no factual basis for the Court of Appeals to conclude that respondent was pressured and/or coerced by Purisima in signing Resolution No. 2013-027, accrediting WERFAST. In his Counter-Affidavit dated December 10, 2014, respondent never raised as a defense that he was pressured and/or coerced by Purisima in signing Resolution No. 2013-027. On the contrary, respondent asserts that WERFAST had substantially complied with the requirements under the Policy on Accreditation.<br><br>Clearly, respondent's act of signing the subject Resolution was of his own free and voluntary will. He was neither forced nor influenced by any other person signing it. Without a doubt, respondent's position as chairman of both the TWG and FEO-CSAB played an important part in the conspiracy, among them, by giving WERFAST an unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
