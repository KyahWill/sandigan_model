G.R. SP No. 116926. The CA dismissed the petition for <em>certiorari</em> assailing the Orders dated August 12, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and September 13, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City, Branch 6 in Civil Case No. 7200-R, which dismissed the Complaint of the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) for reversion, annulment of documents and cancellation of titles with issuance of temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.<p align="center"> <b>Facts</b> </p><p> As summarized by the CA, the antecedents are as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Private respondents, the Heirs of Ikang Paus (private respondents), represented by Elias Paus, filed a petition for identification, delineation and issuance of a Certificate of Ancestral Land Title (CALT) with respondent National Commission [on Indigenous Peoples] (NCIP). They sought confirmation of their right to the ancestral land at Section "J" Baguio City and Witig Suyo, Tuba, Benguet, with an area of 695,737 square meters. The Heirs of Mateo Cariño opposed the petition, and prayed for its dismissal, cancellation and revocation. </p> <p> After due proceedings, the NCIP issued Resolution No. 060-2009, <i>viz</i>.: </p> <blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Commission hereby declares and certifies that the parcels of land described herein is an ancestral land belonging to the Heirs of Ikang Pau[s]. Let the two (2) Certificates of Ancestral Land Title (CALT) bearing CALT No. CAR­TUB-0309-000208 located at Barangay Poblacion, Municipality of Tuba, Province of Benguet be issued in the name of the Heirs of Ikang Paus as indicated in plan SWO-141102155703-D-A-NCIP.</p> <p> The protest filed by the Heirs of Mateo Cariño, represented by Jacqueline Cariño and Judith Cariño is hereby dismissed for lack of merit. </p> <p> UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED. </p> <p>Quezon City, March 19, 2009.</p> </blockquote> <p> Consequently, Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 0-CALT-37<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> covering [a] 623,108[-]square meter lot in Baguio City, was issued in the name of private respondents on April 24, 2009.</p> <p> The Heirs of Mateo Cariño filed a motion for reconsideration, but the NCIP denied it in its Resolution No. 099 dated September 24, 2009. </p> <p> However, on June 10, 2010, the Republic, through the OSG, questioned OCT No. 0-CALT-37 in the name of private respondents, and filed a suit for <em>Reversion, Annulment of Documents and Cancellation of Title with Prayer for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary Injunction</em>. It pointed out several irregularities in the issuance of the CALT in favor of private respondents. x x x</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Private respondents answered the complaint denying all its material allegations. x x x As special and affirmative defenses, they averred lack of jurisdiction and lack of cause of action. They pointed out that the complaint assailed the CALT and the OCT issued on the basis of the CALT, which under the Indigenous (Peoples] Right[s] Act (IPRA), falls within the jurisdiction of the NCIP, and not of the regular courts. They asserted that the RTC has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint; hence, the complaint must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. x x x</p> <p> On July 14, 2010, the RTC issued an Order directing the Republic to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. </p> <p> In its Compliance, the Republic asserted that the RTC had jurisdiction over the complaint. Citing Chapter II of Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 129, it maintained that the RTC had jurisdiction over all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein. The action[s] for reversion, annulment of documents and cancellation of titles are rights of actions or reliefs which are obviously neither within the exclusive nor concurrent jurisdiction of the NCIP. It further asserted that it was never made a party to NCIP En Banc Resolution No. 060-2009-AL (2009). Not being a party to the proceeding, it could not avail of the remedy of filing a petition for review with the CA. The Republic maintained that the CALT and the consequent OCT was null and void. As such, they can be attacked either directly [or] collaterally.</p> <p> The RTC, however, was not at all persuaded by Republic's arguments and rendered the now challenged Order dismissing the complaint. It sustained private respondents that the RTC has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint. The RTC explained that the CALT and the corresponding OCT were issued on the basis of the Resolution 060-2009-AL of the NCIP. Thus, any challenge against the CALT and the OCT necessarily calls for a review of the NCIP Resolution which was made as basis for the issuance ofthe CALT. However, NCIP is a quasi-judicial body with a rank and stature equal to that of the RTC; hence, it cannot review the Resolution of the NCIP or any document that flows from its proceedings.</p> <p> The RTC disposed, thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant case is <b>dismissed without prejudice</b> for lack of jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the complaint. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the RTC denied this. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 65 with the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> <u>CA Decision</u> </p><p>On the procedural issue, the CA ruled that petitioner availed itself of the correct remedy when it filed a Rule 65 petition to assail the RTC's dismissal without prejudice of the Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The CA ruled that the Complaint assails the validity of OCT No. 0-CALT-37 as well as NCIP <em>En Banc</em> Resolution No. 060-2009-AL, Series of 2009<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Resolution No. 060-2009-AL).

The Rules of Court is explicit that a petition under Rule 65 should be filed not later than 60 days from notice. When the Republic filed the petition for <em>certiorari</em> on November 25, 2010, the period to file a Rule 65 petition has already expired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The CA also ruled that for it to rule on the propriety of Resolution No. 060-2009-AL and the validity of the Certificate of Ancestral Land Title (CALT) and OCT, it would have to appreciate and calibrate evidence, which is not the function of a petition for <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 65.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It found that it would be misplaced to attack and rule on the validity of the proceedings of the NCIP and on the CALT and OCT in a petition for <em>certiorari</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The dispositive portion of the CA Decision states: </p><blockquote> <p align="justify"> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.

The Complaint also impleaded the Register of Deeds of Baguio City, the NCIP, and the LRA.</p><p> To the mind of the Court, the case is not a review of the NCIP <em>En Banc </em>Resolution because a subsequent event occurred that gave rise to a cause of action for reversion and cancellation of a Torrens title, namely, the issuance of OCT No. 0-CALT-37. This is the reason the Republic has impleaded the Register of Deeds of Baguio City and the LRA. </p><p> In fact, the Republic alleges that OCT No. 0-CALT-37 should not have been issued since it is land of the public domain. This, in turn, requires a factual determination of whether the land is indeed of public domain and whether OCT No. 0-CALT-37 embraces land inside the BSF. This then raises the issue of whether a CALT may be issued over it, and whether an OCT may be issued arising from the CALT. This is therefore a complaint for the reversion of a land to the public domain and the cancellation of a Torrens title covering a public land, both matters being within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the RTC. </p><p> Under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the RTC has jurisdiction over the following civil cases: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 19. <i>Jurisdiction in Civil Cases</i>.— Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction: </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (2) In all civil actions which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein, where the assessed value of the property involved exceeds Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) or for civil actions in Metro Manila, where such value exceeds Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) except actions for forcible entry into and unlawful detainer of lands or buildings, original jurisdiction over which is conferred upon the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts; </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (8) In all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs or the value of the property in controversy exceeds One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) or, in such other cases in Metro Manila, where the demand, exclusive of the abovementioned items exceeds Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00). </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Republic v. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court held that "[a]ctions for cancellation of title and reversion x x x belong to the class of cases that 'involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein' and where the assessed value of the property exceeds P20,000.00, fall under the jurisdiction of the RTC."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> As the Court held in <i>Malabanan v. Republic</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> "[i]n a reversion suit, we should emphasize, the attack is directed not against the judgment ordering the issuance of title, but against the title that is being sought to be cancelled either because the judgment was not validly rendered, or the title issued did not faithfully reflect the land referred to in the judgment, or because no judgment was rendered at all."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p> The allegations of the Republic in the Complaint squarely assert a reversion suit as described above. It is attacking OCT No. 0-CALT-37 because it arose from Resolution No. 060-2009-AL, which the Republic claims was not validly rendered. </p><p> The Court is not unmindful that in ruling on the issue of the validity of OCT No. 0-CALT-37, the Court will necessarily rule on the validity of CALT No. CAR-BAG-0309-000207, and the reconstructed and unapproved survey plan together with the technical description of Lot 1, SWO-14110215703-D­ A-NCIP, both of which were issued and approved in Resolution 060-2009- AL. This, however, does not remove the Complaint from the RTC's jurisdiction, and as described above, even confirms it. Again, the cause of action of the Republic is for the reversion to the public domain of the lot covered by OCT No. 0-CALT-37 and the cancellation of the title. In ruling on this issue, the RTC may dwell on the validity of the proceedings of the NCIP, which gave rise to the issuance of the Torrens title. The Court's ruling in <i>Republic v. Bacas</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (<i>Bacas</i>) is instructive: </p><blockquote> <p> The success of the annulment of title does not solely depend on the existence of actual and extrinsic fraud, but also on the fact that a judgment decreeing registration is null and void. In <i>Collado v. Court of Appeals and the Republic</i>, the Court declared that any title to an inalienable public land is void <i>ab initio</i>. Any procedural infirmities attending the filing of the petition for annulment of judgment are immaterial since the LRC never acquired jurisdiction over the property. All proceedings of the LRC involving the property are null and void and, hence, did not create any legal effect. A judgment by a court without jurisdiction can never attain finality. In <i>Collado</i>, the Court made the following citation: </p> <blockquote> <p> The <b>Land Registration Court has no jurisdiction over non-registrable properties</b>, such as public navigable rivers which are parts of the public domain, and cannot validly adjudge the registration of title in favor of private applicant. Hence, the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pampanga as regards the Lot No. 2 of certificate of Title No. 15856 in the name of petitioners <b>may be attacked at any time</b>, either <b>directly or collaterally</b>, by the State which is <b>not bound by any prescriptive period</b> provided for by the Statute of Limitations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Bacas</i>, the principal prayer for cancellation of the Torrens title entailed the nullification of a decision of the LRC, a co-equal body of the RTC. Here, similarly, as a result of the prayer for reversion and cancellation of title, the RTC will necessarily have to rule on the validity of Resolution No. 060-2009-AL. The RTC also has to rule on whether the Register of Deeds of Baguio City acted correctly in issuing OCT No. 0-CALT-37 based on CALT No. CAR-BAG-0309-000207. </p><p> Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the Republic's Complaint for lack of jurisdiction. As the Court ruled in <i>Heirs of Spouses Reterta v. Spouses Mores and Lopez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> "The term <i>grave abuse of discretion</i> connotes whimsical and capricious exercise of judgment as is equivalent to excess, or lack of jurisdiction. The abuse must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> The RTC's dismissal of the Complaint is a refusal to perform its duty enjoined by law as it is the court that has jurisdiction over the Complaint. The CA therefore committed reversible error in affirming the RTC's dismissal of the Complaint. </p><p> Nonetheless, the Court finds that the Republic's prayer that the Court rule on its nine causes of action as raised in its Complaint to be premature. A ruling on the nine causes of action requires the presentation and reception of evidence, a function the Court cannot discharge as it is not a trier of facts. There being no trial on the merits yet, it is improper for the Court to rule on the nine causes of action in the Complaint. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>NCIP does not have jurisdiction over the Republic's Complaint.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>As further confirmation that the RTC has jurisdiction over the case is the fact that the NCIP does not have jurisdiction over issues involving non-Indigenous Cultural Communities (ICCs)/Indigenous Peoples (IPs). The NCIP's jurisdiction is defined in Section 66 of the IPRA: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 66. <i>Jurisdiction of the NCIP</i>. — The NCIP, through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over all claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs: <i>Provided, however</i>, That no such dispute shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies provided under their customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP. </p> </blockquote> <p> Interpreting this provision, the Court held in <i>Lim v. Gamosa</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that the NCIP has no power and authority to decide controversies involving non-ICCs/IPs even if it involves rights of ICCs/IPs, as these disputes should be brought before a court of general jurisdiction, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Once again, the primacy of customs and customary law sets the parameters for the NCIP's limited and special jurisdiction and its consequent application in dispute resolution. Demonstrably, the proviso in Section 66 of the IPRA limits the jurisdiction of the NCIP to cases of claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs where both parties are ICCs/IPs because customs and customary law cannot be made to apply to non-ICCs/IPs within the parameters of the NCIP's limited and special jurisdiction. </p> <p> Indeed, non-ICCs/IPs cannot be subjected to this special and limited jurisdiction of the NCIP even if the dispute involves rights of ICCs/IPs since the NCIP has no power and authority to decide on a controversy <b>involving, as well, rights of non-ICCs/IPs which may be brought before a court of general jurisdiction within the legal bounds of rights and remedies</b>. Even as a practical concern, non-IPs and non-members of ICCs ought to be excepted from the NCIP's competence since it cannot determine the right-duty correlative, and breach thereof, between opposing parties who are ICCs/IPs and non-ICCs/IPs, <b><u>the controversy necessarily contemplating application of other laws, not only customs and customary law of the ICCs/IPs.</u></b> In short, the NCIP is only vested with jurisdiction to determine the rights of ICCs/IPs based on customs and customary law in a given controversy against another ICC/IP, but not the applicable law for each and every kind of ICC/IP controversy even against an opposing non-ICC/IP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Additional emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, although the dispute involves the rights of the Heirs of Ikang Paus, who claim to be members of the Ibaloi tribe, the Complaint involves non-ICCs/IPs such as the Republic, the Register of Deeds of Baguio, and even the LRA. The NCIP cannot rule on the rights of non-ICCs/IPs which should be brought before a court of general jurisdiction. Here, the dispute was validly lodged with the RTC as discussed above. </p><p> Further, given the special limited jurisdiction of the NCIP, only those cases over which the NCIP has jurisdiction may be a pealed to the CA following Section 67 of the IPRA: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 67. <i>Appeals to the Court of Appeals</i>. - Decisions of the NCIP shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals by way of a petition for review. </p> </blockquote> <p> It was therefore error for the RTC and the CA to treat the Complaint as an appeal from Resolution No. 060-2009-AL because based on the allegations of the Complaint, the NCIP could not have jurisdiction over it. And in fact, given that NCIP cases are limited to ICCs/IPs, it would even be legally impermissible for a non-ICC/IP to appeal a decision of the NCIP. </p><p> This further confirms that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion because if the RTC dismissal of the Complaint is not undone, the Republic will be denied any kind of remedy to protect its rights and interest over the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>Petition-in-intervention lacks basis.</i></b> </p><p> A Petition-in-Intervention<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> was filed by the Heirs of Mateo Cariño and Bayosa Ortega (Heirs of Cariño and Ortega). They admit that they were not parties to Civil Case No. 7200-R,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> but claim that they have an interest in the property covered by OCT No. 0-CALT-37. In their Petition-in-Intervention, they seek to have Section 53<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the IPRA declared as unconstitutional as it failed to provide sufficient standards to guide the assessment and approval of ancestral land claims, which allows an overreaching and unwarranted exercise of discretion on the part of the NCIP and the Ancestral Domains Office (ADO).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> The intervention lacks basis. </p><p> The requisites for intervention of a non-party, as the Court ruled in <i>Asia's Emerging Dragon Corp. v.

The Petition raises whether the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, ruled correctly in dismissing the Republic's Complaint for reversion and annulment of judgment. The Heirs of Cariño and Ortega do not claim that they have any interest in the outcome of this case. Instead, they would like the Court to rule on the constitutionality of Section 53 of the IPRA. Based on their own allegations, therefore, intervention is improper.</p> <p> Further, ruling on the constitutionality of Section 53 will delay the adjudication of the issue of whether the RTC has jurisdiction over the Republic's Complaint. More importantly, even if allowed to intervene, the issue on the constitutionality of Section 53 of the IPRA is not the very <i>lis mota</i> of this Petition of the Republic. As the Court held in <i>Spouses Mirasol v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Jurisprudence has laid down the following requisites for the exercise of this power: First, there must be before the Court an actual case calling for the exercise of judicial review. Second, the question before the Court must be ripe for adjudication. Third, the person challenging the validity of the act must have standing to challenge. Fourth, the question of constitutionality must have been raised at the earliest opportunity, and lastly, the issue of constitutionality must be the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case. </p> <p> As a rule, the courts will not resolve the constitutionality of a law, if the controversy can be settled on other grounds. The policy of the courts is to avoid ruling on constitutional questions and to presume that the acts of the political departments are valid, absent a clear and unmistakable showing to the contrary. To doubt is to sustain. This presumption is based on the doctrine of separation of powers. This means that the measure had first been carefully studied by the legislative and executive departments and found to be in accord with the Constitution before it was finally enacted and approved. </p> <p> The present case was instituted primarily for accounting and specific performance. The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that PNB's obligation to render an accounting is an issue, which can be determined, without having to rule on the constitutionality of P.D. No. 579. In fact there is nothing in P.D. No. 579, which is applicable to PNB's intransigence in refusing to give an accounting. The governing law should be the law on agency, it being undisputed that PNB acted as petitioners' agent. In other words, the requisite that the constitutionality of the law in question be the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case is absent. Thus we cannot rule on the constitutionality of P.D. No. 579.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, it is unnecessary to rule on the constitutionality of Section 53 of the IPRA in order to arrive at the conclusion that the RTC has jurisdiction over the Republic's Complaint. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
