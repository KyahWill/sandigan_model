The prosecution alleged that at around 3:00 in the afternoon of August 13, 2012, acting on information received from a civilian asset, several officers of the Lipa City Police conducted a buy-bust operation against accused-appellant at a Jollibee branch in Barangay Mataas na Lupa, Lipa City, during which five (5) sachets containing dried marijuana leaves were recovered from him. Upon frisking accused-appellant, police officers found four (4) more sachets containing dried marijuana leaves inside one of his pockets. The officers then marked a total of nine (9) sachets and thereafter brought accused-appellant to their headquarters, where they inventoried<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and photographed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the seized items in the presence of accused-appellant himself, as well as Pablo V. Levita (Levita), the Barangay Captain of Barangay Mataas na Lupa, and Michael Dominic Flores (Flores), a member of radio station 88.7.

In this regard, case law recognizes that "[m]arking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> a representative from the media <u><i>AND</i></u> the DOJ, and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <u><i>OR</i></u> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been 'crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (<i>a</i>) there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (<i>b</i>) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving cause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Anent the witness requirement, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time - beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Notably, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, x x x the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <i>a quo</i>; otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In this case, there was a deviation from the witness requirement as the conduct of the inventory and photography were not witnessed by a representative from the DOJ. This may be easily gleaned from the Inventory of Confiscated Drugs/Seized<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which only confirms the presence of an elected public official, <i>i.e.</i>, Levita, and a representative from the media, <i>i.e.</i>, Flores. Such finding is confirmed by the testimony of Senior Police Officer 1 Arnold T. Quinio (SPO1 Quinio) on cross-examination, to wit:<br><blockquote><center><b>Cross-Examination of SPO1 Quinio</b><br></center><br>[Atty. Ismael H. Macasaet]: How about the DOJ representative?<br>[SPO1 Quinio]: There was <b>no DOJ representative</b> came to the police station, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As earlier stated, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to account for the absence of a required witness by presenting a justifiable reason therefor or, at the very least, by showing that genuine and sufficient efforts were exerted by the apprehending officers to secure his or her presence. Here, records show that the prosecution <b>failed to acknowledge</b>, much less justify, the absence of a DOJ representative. While SPO1 Quinio admitted on crossÂ­ examination that the presence of a DOJ representative was not obtained, he did not offer any explanation for such lapse; neither did the prosecution conduct a re-direct examination to enable him to address the oversight.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In view of such unjustified deviation from the chain of custody rule, the Court is therefore constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from accused-appellant were compromised, which consequently warrants his acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated September 4, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09767 is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, accused-appellant Ronald Jaime De Motor y Dantes is <b>ACQUITTED</b> of the crimes charged.
