				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this appeal is the January 15, 2016 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 07151, which affirmed the November 3, 2014 Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 4, Legazpi City, finding Michael Goyena y Abraham (appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br><b><i>The Antecedent Facts</i></b><br><br>Appellant was charged with the illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 in an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 29, 2012 which reads:<br><blockquote>That on the 28<sup>th</sup> day of November, 2012, in the City of Legazpi, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, knowingly, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver to a PDEA poseur[-]buyer one (1) medium[-]size[d,] heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing Methamphetamine Hydrochloride[,] popularly known as Shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing 0.301 gram, in consideration of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00), without authority of law.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>During his arraignment on December 20,2012, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution's version of the incidents is, as follows:<br><br>On November 28, 2012, at around 10:00 a.m., the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Special Enforcement Team in Camp General Simeon Ola, Legazpi City received information from a confidential informant (CI) that appellant and his sister, Cyramil Goyena (Cyramil), were engaged in the sale of dangerous drugs in Cabangan, Legazpi City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Upon further verification, it was confirmed that Cyramil was indeed included in the PDEA's list of persons suspected of selling dangerous drugs in Albay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In the presence of PDEA Agents Enrico Barba and Jonathan Ivan Revilla (Agent Revilla), the CI called Cyramil to set up the purchase of P3,500.00-worth of <i>shabu</i> for a buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Cyramil agreed and informed the CI that it was appellant who would meet him for this purpose as she was indisposed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The PDEA thereafter coordinated with the Legazpi City Police Intelligence Unit for the conduct of a buy-bust operation against appellant and Cyramil. During the pre-operational briefing, a buy-bust team was formed with Agent Revilla as poseur-buyer, Police Officer 2 Jose Caspe (PO2 Caspe) as back-up and arresting officer, and the other team members as perimeter security.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At around 2:00 p.m., the buy-bust team proceeded to the target area where Agent Revilla and the CI posed as passengers waiting for a ride along the road in front of a dilapidated building; the rest of the team positioned themselves strategically around the area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Not long after, appellant approached Agent Revilla and the CI. After introductions were made, appellant asked Agent Revilla if he was indeed buying P3,500.00-worth of <i>shabu</i>, and the latter replied in the affirmative. Appellant then handed Agent Revilla one medium-sized, heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance suspected as <i>shabu</i>. Agent Revilla, in return, gave appellant the P500.00-marked money and the boodle money. Once the exchange was completed, Agent Revilla turned his baseball cap, the pre-arranged signal that the transaction had been consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Appellant tried to resist when PO2 Caspe placed him under arrest but he was eventually subdued with the help of the other team members.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Agent Revilla then marked the seized plastic sachet with his initials, "JIR-11/28/12," while still at the scene.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> But, due to a brewing commotion, the buy-bust team returned to the police station together with appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>At the police station, PO2 Caspe conducted a body search on the person of appellant, which yielded a black pouch containing the marked money, a Nokia 3310 cellular phone, a lighter and a .22 caliber bullet. PO2 Caspe marked the seized items with his initials, "JBC" and the date of seizure, "11/28/12," and prepared the Certificate of Inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The incidents in the PDEA office were all duly documented by photographs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The inventory-taking of the seized items was witnessed by the appellant, by <i>Barangay</i> Captain Santos Perez, by <i>Barangay Kagawad</i> Richard Diaz, by media representative Darlan Barcelon and by a Department of Justice representative Jesus Arsenio Aragon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>The buy-bust team thereafter proceeded to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office V in Legazpi City where Agent Revilla, who had retained custody over the seized plastic sachet from the time of confiscation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> personally submitted the same, together with the Request for Laboratory Examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to P/SI Wilfredo Pabustan, Jr. (P/SI Pabustan), the forensic chemist, for quantitative and qualitative examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Per Chemistry Report No. D-173-2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the subject specimen tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, more commonly known as <i>shabu</i>.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant <i>denied</i> the allegations against him. He testified that:<br><blockquote>On November 28, 2012[,] at around 3:30 in the afternoon, [appellant] was playing "cara y cruz" at an old building in Cabangan, Legazpi City while waiting for his sibling[,] Cyramil. He momentarily left his group to relieve himself. While heading back to the game, about ten (10) men suddenly accosted him. When he asked why he was being arrested, the men ordered him just to follow them. [Appellant] called for help from the barangay captain and his "cara y cruz" playmates but to no avail.<br><br>The men then handcuffed him and led him away. At this point, he felt something being inserted into his pocket. One of them, who turned out to be [A]gent Revilla, then retrieved a black pouch from [his] pocket and[,] in turn[,] brought out therefrom a five hundred (P500.00)-peso bill and a plastic sachet which contained a substance similar to "tawas." [Appellant] was surprised since the only thing he had in his pocket then was his coin purse.<br><br>He again cried for help because he felt that the men were planting evidence against him. Many people were then starting to arrive at the scene, such that [A] gent Revilla and his companions made [him] board a black vehicle and thereafter brought him to the Legazpi City Police Station where a man named "Caspe" presented the items seized from him. On the arrival of the barangay captain, a kagawad, a representative from the Department of Justice, and a photographer, he was frisked which search yielded his coin purse. His photo was taken and [he was] subsequently subjected to investigation. [Appellant] denied the accusation against him, saying he was merely arrested for illegal gambling, playing "cara y cruz."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Judgment of November 3, 2014, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165. It held that the prosecution succeeded in establishing the elements of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The consummation of the aforesaid sale transaction of illegal drugs was made in the afternoon of November 28, 2012. In the buy-bust operation, the accused, as conspirator of [his] sister Cyramil, was the one who delivered the illegal drug which turned out to be "shabu", subject matter of the aforesaid sale transaction to poseur-buyer Agent Revilla, facilitated by the Cl. Accused also received the payment from Agent Revilla.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC noted that Agent Revilla had positively identified appellant as the person who sold to him the subject <i>shabu</i> in the buy-bust operation on November 28, 2012. The RTC also found the positive testimony of Agent Revilla to be candid, straightforward and credible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P1,000,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Against this judgment, appellant appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>The CA affirmed the RTC's Judgment <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Like the RTC, the CA found that all the elements of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs were satisfactorily established by the prosecution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In the instant case, [appellant's] identity as the culprit cannot be doubted, having been caught in <i>flagrante delicto </i>for selling an illegal drug. He was positively identified as the person who sold to [A]gent Revilla, the poseur-buyer, a heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance during the buy-bust operation. This positive identification prevails as [appellant] could only offer an uncorroborated and weak defense of denial. Against the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, [appellant's] plain denial of the offense charged, unsubstantiated by any credible and convincing evidence, must simply fail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA rejected appellant's contention that his warrantless arrest was illegal, as the prosecution was able to prove that appellant was apprehended after a legitimate buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> "Hence, having been caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i>, the police officers were not only authorized but were even duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the CA held that the law enforcers in this case sufficiently complied with the chain of custody requirement over the seized <i>shabu</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It explained that:<br><blockquote>At any rate, the prosecution had sufficiently shown the law enforcers' unbroken chain of custody over the subject specimen, from the time of [appellant's] arrest up to the submission of the specimen to P/SI Pabustan, Jr. Agent Revilla, the poseur-buyer, marked the seized item in front of [appellant] and thereafter continued the inventory immediately upon arrival at the Police Station in the presence of two (2) barangay officials, [a] media representative, [a] DOJ representative and other members of the buy-bust team. The arresting officers then delivered the seized item to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination on the same day. Then, on the stand, [A]gent Revilla identified the subject specimen bearing the marking "JIR-11/28/12" as the same item retrieved from [appellant] during the buy-bust sale held on 28 November 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the following issues for the Court's resolution:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, whether his warrantless arrest was illegal, for which reason, any evidence obtained from him were inadmissible as evidence for being 'fruits of the poisonous tree';<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>And <b><i>second</i></b>, whether the integrity and identity of the seized <i>shabu</i> had been preserved, considering the PDEA agents' failure to mark and conduct the inventory of the same at the place of arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br>"In a prosecution for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, such as <i>shabu</i>, the following elements must be duly established: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Simply stated, the prosecution must prove that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation of the seized dangerous drugs as evidence in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Dumlao</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we explained that the illegal sale of dangerous drugs is consummated <i>upon the completion of the sale transaction</i> between the buyer and seller, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x The commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction, which happens the moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller. Settled is the rule that as long as the police officer went through the operation as a buyer and his offer was accepted by appellant and the dangerous drugs delivered to the former, the crime is considered consummated by the delivery of the goods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the prosecution positively identified appellant as the seller of the white crystalline substance which was later found to be methamphetamine hydrochloride, more commonly known as <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It was also shown that appellant had sold the <i>shabu</i> to Agent Revilla, the poseur-buyer, for a sum of P3,500.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The heat-sealed, transparent plastic sachet containing said white crystalline substance presented before the trial court was positively identified by Agent Revilla as the <i>shabu</i> sold and delivered to him by appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Per the Chemistry Report No. D-173-2012 dated November 28, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the white crystalline substance found inside the same plastic sachet indeed tested positive for <i>shabu</i>.<br><br>We also find that the prosecution had sufficiently established that appellant was caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu</i> in a legitimate entrapment operation. Aside from the Authority to Operate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and the Pre-Operation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> on record, the prosecution witnesses also described in detail the events leading to and during the conduct of the buy-bust operation against appellant. Hence, appellant's warrantless arrest and the subsequent search on his person are perfectly legal.<br><br>In <i>People v. Andaya</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> we held that "a buy-bust operation is a valid and legitimate form of entrapment of the drug pusher,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>x x x In such operation, the poseur buyer transacts with the suspect by purchasing a quantity of the dangerous drugs and paying the price agreed upon, and in turn[,] the drug pusher turns over or delivers the dangerous drug subject of their agreement in exchange for the price or consideration. Once the transaction is consummated, the drug pusher is arrested, and can be held to account under the criminal law. The justification that underlies the legitimacy of the buy-bust operation is that the suspect is arrested <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, that is, the suspect has just committed, or is in the act of committing, or is attempting to commit the offense in the presence of the arresting police officer or private person. <b>The arresting police officer or private person is favored in such instance with the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>We find no sufficient reason to overturn the presumption of regularity in favor of the PDEA agents, given appellant's failure to present <i>clear and convincing evidence</i> that the PDEA agents did not properly perform their duties or that they were inspired by improper motive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We likewise agree with the CA's conclusion that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized <i>shabu</i> had been preserved.<br><br>The record shows that Agent Revilla immediately put the markings "JIR-11/28/12" on the seized heat-sealed, transparent plastic sachet while still at the scene and in the presence of appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Moreover, Agent Revilla, who had retained custody over the heat-sealed, transparent plastic sachet from the time of confiscation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> personally delivered said plastic sachet together with the request for laboratory examination to P/SI Pabustan at the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> After the laboratory examination, P/SI Pabustan marked and sealed the subject specimen and turned it over to the evidence custodian.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the prosecution's evidence sufficiently established an <i>unbroken</i> chain of custody over the seized sachet of <i>shabu</i> from the entrapment team to the crime laboratory, to the evidence custodian for safe­keeping, up to the time it was offered in evidence before the court.<br><br>In conclusion, we affirm appellant's conviction of the offense charged. The penalty for the unauthorized sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, regardless of the quantity and purity, is life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00. However, given the enactment of RA 9346,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> only life imprisonment and a fine may be imposed upon appellant. Thus, we find that the penalty of life imprisonment and payment of fine in the amount of P1,000,000.00 is within the range prescribed by law.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
