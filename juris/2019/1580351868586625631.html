CR No. 09057, which affirmed the Joint Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated February 13, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 79 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. R-QZN-16-02795-CR and R-QZN-16-02796-CR finding accused-appellant Rosemarie Gabunaday Talisic (Gabunada) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><div align="center"><b>The</b><b> Facts</b><br></div> <br>This case stemmed from two (2) Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed before the RTC accusing Gabunada of the crimes of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution alleged that in the early morning of March 19, 2016, policemen of the Quezon City District Anti-Illegal Drug – Special Operation Task Group successfully conducted a buy-bust operation against Gabunada, during which one (1) plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance was recovered from her. When Gabunada was searched incidental to her arrest, the policemen recovered four (4) other plastic sachets also containing white crystalline substance from her. The seized sachets were then marked, and thereafter, inventoried and photographed in the presence of Gabunada and Barangay Kagawad Leonardo Sinque (Kgd. Sinque). Thereafter, Gabunada and the seized items were taken to the police headquarters where the necessary paperworks for examination were prepared. The seized items were then brought to the crime laboratory for examination, where they tested positive for <i>methamphetamine</i> <i>hydrochloride</i> or <i>shabu,</i> a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In defense, Gabunada denied the charges against her, claiming instead, that she was in SM Bicutan in the afternoon of March 18, 2016 to meet her relative. She was waiting to board a jeepney on her way home when she was stopped by a man and a woman who introduced themselves as police officers. The said officers suddenly arrested her and took her to Camp Karingal in Quezon City. Thereafter, at around 3:00 in the morning of March 19, 2016, a police woke her up, boarded her in a vehicle, and brought her near Balintawak Market along EDSA, Quezon City, where she saw a barangay kagawad sign an "Inventory of Seized Items." Gabunada was also asked to sign the document, but she refused. She was then brought back to Camp Caringal, and it was only at that time that she first saw the alleged <i>shabu,</i> money, and an Octagon paper bag on top of a table.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In a Joint Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated February 13, 2017, the RTC found Gabunada guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged, and accordingly, sentenced her as follows: <i>(a)</i> in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-02795-CR, to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00; and <i>(b)</i> in Criminal Case No. R-QZN-16-02796-CR, to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The RTC found that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt that Gabunada indeed sold one (1) plastic bag containing dangerous drugs to the poseur-buyer during a buy-bust operation, resulting in her arrest, and that during the search incidental thereto, she was found to be in possession of a red paper bag with four (4) more plastic bags of dangerous drugs. Moreover, it held that notwithstanding the absence of a Department of Justice (DOJ) representative or a media representative, the identity of the illegal drugs had been preserved under the chain of custody rule. On the other hand, the RTC did not give credence to Gabunada's defense of denial or frame-up due to her failure to prove any improper motive on the part of the buy bust team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Aggrieved, Gabunada appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to the CA.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated April 26, 2018, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It held that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crimes charged against Gabunada, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items had been preserved due to the arresting officers' substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule. It added that the absence of a representative from the DOJ or the media was not fatal, as there was substantial compliance on the requisite witnesses of the inventory and photograph of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal seeking that Gabunada's conviction be overturned.<br><br><div align="center"><b>The</b><b> Court's</b><b> Ruling</b><br></div>  <br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus</i> <i>delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus</i> <i>delicti</i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter</i> <i>alia,</i> that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same. In this regard, case law recognizes that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u></i> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or (b) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (NPS) <i><u>OR</u></i> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been 'crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <i>ipso</i> <i>facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: <i>(a)</i> there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and <i>(b)</i> the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non­ compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Anent the witness requirement, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time – beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Notably, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, x x x the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <i>a quo;</i> otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In this case, it would initially appear that the policemen complied with the witness requirement under RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> considering that the Inventory of Seized Properties/Items<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> contains the signatures of an elected public official, <i>i.e.,</i> Kgd. Sinque, and a media representative, <i>i.e., </i> Ernie Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz). However, a more circumspect examination of the records would show that Dela Cruz was not present during the conduct of inventory and photography of the seized items. In fact, Dela Cruz himself admitted on re-direct and re-cross examination that one of the arresting police officers merely brought the aforementioned inventory form to him for his signature, two (2) days after the buy-bust, inventory, and photography occurred, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote><div align="center"><b>REDIRECT-EXAMINATION</b><br></div><br>[Atty. Gil A.

VALERA: <br>Q: When you signed that document in your office, by the way, where is your office located?<br>A: At Police Station 10 of Kamuning Quezon City, sir.<br><br>Q: You said that you were a member of the Quezon City Press Corp[s], as indicated in that document, where is that office of Quezon City Press Corp[s]?<br>A: Beside the Police Station 10, sir.<br><br>Q: It is not inside? <br>A: Not inside, sir.<br><br>Q: And you said in your Affidavit that when you signed that, it was Police Officer Bibe who approached (sic) to sign that; what items if any did she show to you?<br>A: One plastic sachet of drugs, sir.<br><br>Q: Only one sachet? <br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>THE COURT: <br>Q: And why did you sign this Inventory when they indicated several items such as [c]ellphone, bag containing six sealed transparent plastic bags? <br>A: That is the only item presented to me, Your Honor, because at that time, I was also in a hurry to go to Batangas.<br><br>Q: Is that your usual practice to sign documents which are incomplete? <br>A: PO2 Bibe is my friend that is why I signed that document.<br><br>Q: So, you always do that to a friend? <br>A: No, Your Honor.<br><br>Q: You are a media representative? <br>A: Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><br><div align="center"><b>[RE]CROSS-EXAMINATION</b><br></div><br>[Assistant Prosecutor Nilda Ordoño]: When you signed that document, you said that some spaces herein were left blank, why did you still sign it? [Media Representative Dela Cruz]: I thought that the date I signed it will be the one that they would indicate in the Inventory, ma'am.<br><br>Q: Considering that you are a media representative, did you report this incident to your newspaper Remate? <br>A: Yes, ma'am.<br><br>Q: And what is the basis of your report? <br>A: That the accused was arrested, ma'am. <br>Q: The Inventory of Seized Properties is that the basis of your report as a reporter? <br>A: No, ma'am, it was based solely on the actual incident on how the accused was arrested.<br><br>Q: Where did you get that story? <br>A: From their report, ma'am.<br><br>Q: From whom, from the Police? <br>A: Yes, ma'am.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote><br>As may be gleaned from the foregoing, the inventory was <i><b>not </b></i>conducted in the presence of Dela Cruz, as the arresting policemen already prepared the inventory form days before it was brought to him for his signature. As discussed, the witness requirement mandates the presence of the required witnesses <u><b><i>during</i></b></u> the conduct of the inventory, so as to ensure that the evils of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence will be adequately prevented. Hence, non-compliance therewith puts the onus on the prosecution to provide a justifiable reason therefor, especially considering that the rule exists to ensure that protection is given to those whose life and liberty are put at risk.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Unfortunately, no such explanation was proferred by the prosecution to justify this glaring procedural lapse. In view of this unjustified deviation from the chain of custody rule, the Court is therefore constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Gabunada were compromised, which consequently warrants her acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b> the appeal is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated April 26, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
