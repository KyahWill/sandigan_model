				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this ordinary appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 16, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 07676, which affirmed the Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated August 26, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte, Branch 39 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 14502 and 14503 finding accused-appellant Lito Paming y Javier (Paming) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>This case stemmed from two (2) Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed before the RTC accusing Paming of the crimes of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, respectively defined and penalized under Sections 5 and 11, Article II ofRA 9165. The prosecution alleged that at around 12:30 in the morning ofSeptember 14, 2010, members of the Paracale Municipal Police Station, with a civilian informant, successfully implemented a buy-bust operation against Paming, during which one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 0.03 gram of white crystalline substance was recovered from him. When Paming was searched after his arrest, the police officers were able to seize a matchbox holding twenty-eight (28) more heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing a combined weight of 0.85 gram of white crystalline substance from his possession. The police officers then took Paming to a nearby billiard hall for marking of the confiscated drugs, but due to the increasing number of people, they transferred to the police station to continue the marking. At the police station, the seized items were turned over to the Desk Officer and the Investigator, who instructed the poseur-buyer to put markings on the items. Thereafter, the seized items were brought to the crime laboratory where, after examination, the contents thereof yielded positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu,</i> a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In defense, Paming denied the charges against him, claiming instead, that he was having a drinking spree with friends when he was approached by one Gil alias "Tatong" who told him that he wanted to "score." When he replied that he did not know what that meant, five men suddenly ganged up on him and dragged him to a nearby billiard hall where they took from his possession P5,000.00, one-half (1/2) bahay of gold and two (2) P20.00 bills. Tatong then shouted: <i>"Sir, nandito po sa posporo,"</i> and handed a matchbox to Police Officer 2 Jason R. Poot (PO2 Poot), who pocketed it. Paming was then brought to the police station where he was detained for two days, and was later made to sign a piece of paper purportedly containing an inventory of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In a Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated August 26, 2014, the RTC found Paming guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged, and accordingly, sentenced him as follows: (a) in Criminal Case No. 14502, to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, and to pay a fine in the amount of P400,000.00; and (b) in Criminal Case No. 14503, to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine in the amount of P500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The RTC found that the prosecution, through the testimonial and documentary evidence it presented, had established beyond reasonable doubt that Paming indeed sold one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing dangerous drugs to the poseur-buyer, resulting in his arrest, and that during the search incidental thereto, he was discovered to be in possession of a matchbox holding twenty-eight (28) more heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets of dangerous drugs. It likewise held that, notwithstanding the procedural lapses of the buy-bust team in complying with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, the integrity and evidentiary value of the illegal drugs were duly preserved under the chain of custody rule. On the other hand, the RTC found untenable Paming's defense of a self-serving unsubstantiated denial or claim of frame-up due to his failure to allege, much less prove, any ill motive on the part of the buy-bust team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Aggrieved, Paming appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to the CA.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated January 16, 2018, the CA affirmed the RTC ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It held that the prosecution had established beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crimes charged against Paming, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved due to the arresting officers' substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal seeking that Paming's conviction be overturned.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same. In this regard, case law recognizes that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u></i> the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or (b) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <i><u>OR</u></i> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been 'crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (a) there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) ofRA 9165, which was later adopted into the text ofRA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It should, however, be emphasized that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must duly explain the reasons behind the procedurallapses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and that the justifiable ground for non­ compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Anent the witness requirement, non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear. While the earnestness of these efforts must be examined on a case-to-case basis, the overarching objective is for the Court to be convinced that the failure to comply was reasonable under the given circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time- beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest - to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand, knowing fully well that they would have to strictly comply with the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Notably, the Court, in <i>People v. Miranda,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> issued a definitive reminder to prosecutors when dealing with drugs cases. It implored that "[since] the [procedural] requirements are clearly set forth in the law, the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings <i>a quo;</i> otherwise, it risks the possibility of having a conviction overturned on grounds that go into the evidence's integrity and evidentiary value, albeit the same are raised only for the first time on appeal, or even not raised, become apparent upon further review."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In this case, there appears to be an absence of the required inventory­ taking in the presence of the accused, or his representative, and the required witnesses, <i>i.e.,</i> the elected public official and representatives from the media and the DOJ. A thorough examination of the records of this case reveals that no physical inventory report was submitted as evidence before the lower court. Although photographs were offered, there was no proof that these were done in the presence of the accused, or the required witnesses. This was also confirmed by the testimony of the arresting officer, PO2 Poot on cross­ examination, to wit:<br><br><center><b>Cross-Examination</b></center><blockquote>[Atty. Fernando F. Dialogo]: And when you arrived at the Police Station, what happened to the shabu?<br>[PO2 Poot]: It was marked in the investigation room, sir.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: When the markings were made, was there any local officials at your station during that time?<br>A: None, sir.<br><br>Q: How about any representative from the media, Mr. Witness?<br>A: None, sir.<br><br>Q: How about the PDEA representative, Mr. Witness<br>A: None, sir.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: Mr. Witness, was there an inventory made on this item that was allegedly recovered from the accused?<br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: Were you present when the inventory was made, Mr. Witness?<br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: Where was the accused when the inventory was made?<br>A: In the investigation room, sir.<br><br>Q: And where was the exact place when the inventory was made?<br>A: At the Police Station because during that time the place of operation was dark. So we brought it to the Police Station.<br><br>x x x x <br><br>Q: You said there was an inventory report made?<br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: Who signed the inventory report?<br>A: The Investigation, sir.<br><br>Q: Are you referring to the Investigator?<br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: He was the only person who signed that inventory report?<br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: Where were you when the inventory was conducted by the Investigator?<br>A: I was inside the Police Station, sir.<br><br>Q: You were not at the investigation room, Witness?<br>A: Yes, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>As earlier stated, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that there was an actual inventory and photography done, and that it was conducted in the presence of the accused and the required witnesses. While PO2 Poot claimed that there was a purported inventory report, none was offered in evidence. This raises serious doubts as to its existence. Even assuming that there was such a report, PO2 Poot likewise confirmed that only the Investigator signed the same. In fact, the accused was in the investigation room while the alleged inventory was conducted. Furthermore, none of the required witnesses were present, and no justifiable reason was offered nor was there a showing that genuine and sufficient efforts were exerted by the apprehending officers to secure their presence. In view of these unjustified deviations from the chain of custody rule, the Court is therefore constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from Paming were compromised, which consequently warrants his acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated January 16, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
