Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which ruling was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The CTA First Division further held that:<br><blockquote>Without a doubt, the provision of R.A. No. 8240 in controversy merely mandates that the three-year transition period within which it is to be operative, starting from January 1, 1997, the date when the law took effect, expired on December 31, 1999. During the said period, the tax shall not be lower than the tax imposed for each brand on October 1, 1996. In other words, the increase adverted to in R.A. No. 8240 should not use the rate imposed at the end of the transition period as tax base. Rather, the provision should be interpreted as to mean that at the end of the transition period, an increase in the excise tax rate should have reached 12% than that imposed under the ad valorem tax scheme.<br><br>Applying the foregoing jurisprudence, we rule that the disputed provision of RR No. 17-99 is not consistent with the situation contemplated under the provisions of Section 143 of the 1997 NIRC, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is clear from the above-quoted provision of the 1997 NIRC that the objective of the government at the end of the three-year transition period is to effect a 12% tax rate increase using as tax base the figures provided in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Section 143 of the 1997 NIRC, in lieu of the tax rate being imposed prior to January 1, 2000, which is the rate imposed during the transition period of three years. At most, Section 143 of the 1997 NIRC imports that the excise tax shall not be lower than the tax which is due from each brand on October 1, 1996, but which qualification is not present as to the increase by 12% on January 1, 2000 under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the said section. Therefore, as correctly pointed out by petitioner, it shall be entitled to its claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate for the erroneously paid excise taxes covering the period of January 11, 2001 to December 31, 2002, considering that its payment was based on the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1 of RR No. 17-99 which was already ruled as an invalid regulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>The CTA First Division noted that per its computation, SMC paid excess excise taxes on the volume of removals of its Red Horse beer from its production plants from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002 in the total amount of P95,074,832.16, but it was only claiming tax refund or credit of the excess excise taxes it had paid from January 11, 2001 to December 31, 2002 amounting to P94,494,801.96.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Although SMC was able to present evidence in support of its total claim for tax refund or credit, without the CIR presenting any controverting evidence, the CTA First Division disallowed the claim of SMC for P6,404,270.40 because it was already barred by prescription.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The CTA First Division explained that based on Section 229, in relation to Section 130(A)(2), of the Tax Reform Act of 1997, the reckoning point for computing the two (2)-year prescriptive period for the refund of erroneously paid taxes shall be from the date of payment of the tax or prior to the removal of the subject products from the place of production; and "[s]ince the Petition for Review was filed on February 24, 2003, the two-year prescriptive period started to run on February 24, 2001 and any [claim for tax refund or credit of] excise tax payment made before February 24, 2001 had already prescribed.

Thus, the CTA First Division had to reckon the prescriptive period from the due date of payment of the excise tax which was before the removal of the subject products from the place of production. The CTA First Division likewise found that even though Annex 1 of Exhibit AA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of SMC showed a detailed schedule of its advance excise tax deposits from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002, the actual payments of excise tax for the months of January and February 2001 could not be ascertained from the said schedule.

Since SMC failed to present proof of the exact amount it paid for the period February 1 to 23, 2001, the tribunal has no basis on how to apportion the amount of the excise tax payment corresponding to said period <i>vis-a-vis</i> the total amount of excise tax paid for February 2001, especially when SMC only presented monthly removal reports.

Clearly and unmistakably, <b>Section 145 mandates a new rate of excise tax for cigarettes packed by machine due to the 12% increase effective on 1 January 2000 without regard to whether the revenue collection starting from this period may turn out to be lower than that collected prior to this date</b>.<br><br>By adding <b>the qualification that the tax due after the 12% increase becomes effective shall not be lower than the tax actually paid prior to 1 January 2000</b>, Revenue Regulation No. 17-99 effectively imposes a tax which is the higher amount between the <i>ad valorem</i> tax being paid at the end of the three (3)-year transition period and the specific tax under paragraph C, sub-paragraph[s] (1)-(4), as increased by 12% - a situation <b>not supported by the plain wording of Section 145 of the Tax Code</b>.<br><br>This is not the first time that national revenue officials had ventured [into] the area of <b>unauthorized administrative legislation</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst><br><irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst></blockquote>Section 143 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 on fermented liquor,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> just like Section 145 of the same Act on cigars and cigarettes, provides that the specific tax rates on the taxable product shall be increased by twelve percent (12%) on January 1, 2000; and that he excise tax from any brand of the taxable product within the next three years of effectivity of RA 8240 shall not be lower than the tax due from each brand on October 1, 1996. As SMC correctly contended, the Decision in <i>Fortune Tobacco</i> applies to the present case, and the disputed provision of&nbsp; No. 17-99 - imposing the added qualification that the new specific tax rate for any existing brand of the taxable product shall not be lower than the excise tax that is actually being paid prior to January 1, 2000 - is similarly not supported by Section 143 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997.<br><br>In any case, the Court had already settled in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

It provides for two periods: the first is the 3-year transition period beginning January 1, 1997, the date when R.A. No. 8240 took effect, until December 31, 1999; and the second is the period thereafter. During the 3-year transition period, Section 143 provides that "the excise tax from any brand of fermented liquor ... shall not be lower than the tax which was due from each brand on October 1, 1996." After the transitory period, Section 143 provides that the excise tax rate shall be the figures provided under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Section 143 but increased by 12%, without regard to whether such rate is lower or higher than the tax rate that is actually being paid prior to January 1, 200 and therefore, without regard to whether the revenue collection stating January 1, 2000 may turn out to be lower than that collected prior to said date. <u>Revenue Regulations No. 17-99</u>, however, <b>created a new tax rate</b> when it added in the last paragraph of Section 1 thereof, the qualification that the tax due after the 12% increase becomes effective "shall not be lower than the tax actually paid prior to January 1, 2000." As there is nothing in Section 143 of the <u>Tax Reform Act of 1997</u> which clothes the BIR with the power or authority to rule that the new specific tax rate should not be lower than the excise tax that is actually being paid prior to January 1, 2000, <b>such interpretation is clearly an invalid exercise of the power of the Secretary of Finance to interpret tax laws and to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the effective enforcement of the <u>Tax Reform Act of 1997</u>. Said qualification must, perforce, be struck down as invalid and of no effect</b>.<br><br>It bears reiterating that tax burdens are not to be imposed, nor presumed to be imposed beyond what the statute expressly and clearly imports, tax statutes being construed <i>strictissimi juris</i> against the government. <b>In case of discrepancy between the basic law and a rule or regulation issued to implement said law, the basic law prevails as said rule or regulation cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the basic law.</b> It must be stressed that the objective of issuing BIR Revenue Regulations is to establish parameters or guidelines within which our tax laws should be implemented, and not to amend or modify its substantive meaning and import.

Counting back from February 24, 2003, the CTA First Division determined that the reckoning date for the two (2)-year prescriptive period for this particular judicial claim of SMC was February 24,2001 and accordingly declared that the claim of SMC for excess excise tax paid prior to said date had already prescribed. This conclusion of the CTA First Division, as affirmed by the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, is in full accord with the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 and so the Court will not disturb the same.<br><br>SMC posits, however, that the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> applies to the Government and that under Article 1145 of the Civil Code, actions upon a quasi-contract must be filed within six (6) years.<br><br>The argument of SMC is without merit.<br><br>At the outset, the Court notes that none of the cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> invoked by SMC in its Petition actually involved Section 229 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 <i>vis-a-vis</i> Article 1145 of the Civil Code.<br><br>It is true that in <i>Fortune Tobacco</i>, the Court held that the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> applies to the Government in matters of tax refund or credit of erroneously paid taxes and penalties:<br><blockquote>Finally, the Commissioner's contention that a tax refund partakes the nature of a tax exemption does not apply to the tax refund to which Fortune Tobacco is entitled. There is parity between tax refund and tax exemption only when the former is based either on a tax exemption statute or a tax refund statute. Obviously, that is not the situation here. Quite the contrary, Fortune Tobacco's claim for refund is premised on its erroneous payment of the tax, or better still the government's exaction in the absence of a law.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>A claim for tax refund may be based on statutes granting tax exemption or tax refund. In such case, the rule of strict interpretation against the taxpayer is applicable as the claim for refund partakes of the nature of an exemption, a legislative grace, which cannot be allowed unless granted in the most explicit and categorical language. The taxpayer must show that the legislature intended to exempt him from the tax by words too plain to be mistaken.<br><br>Tax refunds (or tax credits), on the other hand, are not founded principally on legislative grace but on the legal principle which underlies all quasi-contracts abhorring a person's unjust enrichment at the expense of another. The dynamic of erroneous payment of tax fits to a tee the prototypic quasi-contract, <i>solutio indebiti</i>, which covers not only mistake in fact but also mistake in law.<br><br>The Government is not exempt from the application of <i>solutio indebiti</i>. Indeed, the taxpayer expects fair dealing from the Government, and the latter has the duty to refund without any unreasonable delay what it has erroneously collected. If the State expects its taxpayers to observe fairness and honesty in paying their taxes, it must hold itself against the same standard in refunding excess (or erroneous) payments of such taxes. It should not unjustly enrich itself at the expense of taxpayers. And so, given its essence, a claim for tax refund necessitates only preponderance of evidence for its approbation like in any other ordinary civil case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Citations omitted)<irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst><br><irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst></blockquote>Notably, the above discussion was limited to the issue of whether a tax refund partakes the nature of a tax exemption which shall be interpreted or applied strictly against the taxpayer. It did not address the issue of the applicable prescriptive period for a claim for tax refund/credit of erroneously paid taxes. Additionally, in <i>Fortune Tobacco</i>, the Court explicitly stated that the Tax Code itself had already recognized the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>Under the Tax Code itself, apparently in recognition of the pervasive quasi-contract principle, a claim for tax refund may be based on the following: (a) erroneously or illegally assessed or collected internal revenue taxes; (b) penalties imposed without authority; and (c) any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Citation omitted)<irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst><br><irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst></blockquote>Meanwhile, in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Manila Electric Co. (Meralco)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court squarely addressed the issue of which prescriptive period shall apply to a claim for tax refund of erroneously paid/remitted tax on interest income, whether the two (2) year prescriptive period under Section 229 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 or he six (6)-year prescriptive period for actions based on <i>solutio indebiti</i> under Article 1145 of the Civil Code. The Court therein applied the two (2)-year prescriptive period under the Tax Reform Act of 1997 which is mandatory regardless of any supervening cause that may arise after payment and categorically declared that <i>solutio indebiti</i> was inapplicable, ratiocinating as follows:<br><blockquote>In this regard, petitioner is misguided when it relied upon the six (6)-year prescriptive period for initiating an action on the ground of quasi­-contract or <i>solutio indebiti</i> under Article 1145 of the New Civil Code. There is <i>solutio indebiti</i> where: (1) payment is made when there exists no binding relation between the payor, who has no duty to pay, and the person who received the payment; and (2) the payment is made through mistake, and not through liberality or some other cause. Here, there is a binding relation between petitioner as the taxing authority in this jurisdiction and respondent MERALCO which is bound under the law to act as a withholding agent of NORD/LB Singapore Branch, the taxpayer. Hence, the <b>first element of <i>solutio indebiti</i> is lacking. Moreover, such legal precept is inapplicable to the present case since the Tax Code, a special law, explicitly provides for a mandatory period for claiming a refund for taxes erroneously paid.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted).<irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst><br><irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst></blockquote>Citing Meralco, the Court again, in <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Metrobank), rejected the application to tax refund cases of the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> as well as the six (6)-year prescriptive period for claims based on quasi-contract. It reiterated that both administrative and judicial claims for tax refund or credit should be filed within the two (2)-year prescriptive period fixed under Section 229 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997.<br><br>Although the <i>Meralco</i> and <i>Metrobank</i> cases involved erroneously paid taxes on interest income, these may still constitute jurisprudential precedents for the present case concerning excise tax, as both types of national revenue taxes are imposed and collected by virtue of the Tax Reform Act of 1997. Given that the excise taxes on the <i>Red Horse</i> beer product of SMC is imposed and collected under the Tax Reform Act of 1997, then its claim for refund or credit of said taxes illegally or erroneously collected shall logically be governed by the same law, including the applicable prescriptive period for such claim. There is no need to refer to the Civil Code provisions on quasi­-contract. As already pointed out by the Court in <i>Meralco</i>, the Tax Reform Act of 1997 is a special law, and it is a basic tenet in statutory construction that between a general law and a special law, the special law prevails. <i>Generalia specialibus non derogant</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The assertion of SMC - that nothing in Section 229 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997 supports the contention that payments of taxes imposed under an invalid revenue law or regulation falls within its scope<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> - is specious and constitutes a very literal and superficial understanding of said provision. Necessarily, the declaration by this Court in <i>Fortune Tobacco</i> that RR No. 17-99 is invalid and of no effect rendered the collection of taxes thereunder baseless and, thus, illegal. This gives the taxpayer the right to request the return of such illegally collected taxes under Section 229 of the Tax Reform Act of 1997, provided it does so within the prescriptive period as prescribed in the same provision.<br><br>SMC's argument that its claims should be excepted from the two (2)­ year prescriptive period based on equity considerations is untenable; the Court cannot resort to equity when there is clear statutory law governing the matter. Relevant herein are the following pronouncements of the Court in <i>Republic v. Provincial Government of Palawan</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><blockquote>The Court finds the submission untenable. Our courts are basically courts of law, not courts of equity. Furthermore, for all its conceded merits, equity is available only in the absence of law and not as its replacement. As explained in the old case of <i>Tupas v. Court of Appeals</i>:<br><blockquote>Equity is described as justice outside legality, which simply means that it cannot supplant although it may, as often happens, supplement the law. We said in an earlier case, and we repeat it now, that all abstract arguments based only on equity should yield to positive rules, which [preempt] and prevail over such persuasions. Emotional appeals for justice, while the may wring the heart of the Court, cannot justify disregard of the mandate of the law as long as it remains in force. he applicable maxim, which goes back to the ancient days of the Roman jurists - and is now still reverently observe - is "<i>aequetas nunquam contravenit legis</i>."

Philippine National Bank</i> (<i>PNB</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> but the ruling of the Court in said case was based on unique factual considerations, to wit: (a) respondent PNB made advance income tax payment in 1981 in the amount of P180,000,000.00 in response to then President Corazon C. Aquino's call to generate more revenues for national development; (b) after applying said advance income tax payment against its tax liabilities at the end of 1991, PNB still had a credit balance of P73,298,892.60; (c) PNB carried-over its credit balance to the years 1992 to 1996 but was unable to apply the same as it incurred losses and was in a net loss position for the said four years and (d) PNB applied for tax credit certificate for the P73,298,892.60 only in 1997. It is in consideration of the foregoing special circumstances that the Court, in <i>PNB</i>, suspended the application of the two (2)-year prescriptive period for reasons of equity and fairness and still granted the application of PNB for tax credit certificate in 1997. It further ruled therein that in the strict legal viewpoint, the claim for tax credit of PNB did not proceed from or was a consequence of overpayment of tax erroneously or illegally collected in 1991. Clearly, the factual background in <i>PNB</i> is far different from that in the case at bar and the ruling in the former could not be simply applied or extended to the latter by analogy.<br><br>Finally, SMC avers that the CTA First Division and the CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred in (a) failing to consider that SMC availed itself of the Advance Payment Scheme under RR No. 2-97 for its excise taxes which allows it to remove the products from the place of production and file the prescribed returns and supporting attachments even a week after the actual removal, so that the date of removal may not always be the reckoning point for purposes of prescription; and (b) denying the full amount of its claim for tax refund or credit for the month of February when the CIR presented sufficient evidence to guide the tax court in making the necessary apportionment or allocation of the amounts that had already prescribed.<br><br>This contention fails to persuade.<br><br>"It is a basic rule of evidence that each party must prove its affirmative allegation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The burden rests upon SMC to present evidence that its prescribed returns for the excise taxes on its Red Horse beer product for February 2001 were actually filed after the removal of the said products from the place of production or later than February 24, 2001.

However, as the CTA First Division observed:<br><blockquote>[S]ince the removal reports presented by [SMC] were on a monthly and not on a daily basis, this Court cannot ascertain which portion of the entire claim for the month of February 200[1] in the amount of [Ph] 3,889,761.48 corresponds to the payment made by [SMC] on February 24, 2001 and falls within the two-year prescriptive period. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst><br><irst division="" declaring="" the="" full="" amount="" of="" smc's="" claim="" for="" month="" february="" 2001="" as="" time-barred.<br=""></irst></blockquote>Interestingly, even in its Petition before this Court, SMC failed to present a definitive computation of the excise taxes on its Red Horse beer product which it had paid from February 24 to 28,2001 and which would still have been within the two (2)-year prescriptive period; and to cite the corresponding evidence on record in support thereof. Instead, it unduly placed the burden of apportionment of its February 2001 claim upon the CTA by simply and conveniently asserting that the tax court "could have determined, based on the evidence presented, the portion which had [already] prescribed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court had previously ruled that "the sufficiency of a claimant's evidence and the determination of the amount of refund, as called for in this case, are <i>questions of fact</i>, which are for the judicious determination by the CTA of the evidence on record."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It is already an established rule in this jurisdiction that only questions of law may be raised under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
