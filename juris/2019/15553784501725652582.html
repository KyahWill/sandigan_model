				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an ordinary appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by accused-appellants Edwin Alconde <i>y</i> Madla (Alconde) and Julius Querquelay Rebaca (Querquela; collectively, accused-appellants) assailing the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 29, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01578-MIN, which affirmed the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 10, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental, Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 23 (RTC) in Crim. Case Nos. CR-DRG-2015-414 and CR-DRG-2015-415, finding: (a) Alconde guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002;" and <i>(b)</i> accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of the same Act.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>This case stemmed from two (2) separate Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed before the RTC, respectively charging Alconde of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs and accused-appellants of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. The prosecution alleged that on August 9, 2015, the members of the Puerto Police Station 6 arrested a certain Angkie<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for violation of RA 9165 and held him for further questioning. In the course thereof, Angkie revealed that Alconde was his source of <i>shabu, </i> prompting Police Officer 3 Armando Occe√±a Agravante (PO3 Agravante) to arrange a meet-up with the latter in Purok 7, Balubal, Cagayan de Oro City. Accordingly, a buy-bust operation was conducted, and the team proceeded to the said area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> When accused-appellants arrived, PO3 Agravante immediately handed over the P1,000.00 worth of marked money to Querquela; in exchange, Alconde gave the two (2) sachets containing a total of 0.1903 gram of <i>shabu </i> to PO3 Agravante.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Shortly thereafter, PO3 Agravante executed the pre-arranged signal, prompting Senior Police Officer 1 Rey Abecia to rush towards the scene and restrain Alconde. Meanwhile, PO3 Agravante frisked Querquela and recovered from him the marked money. He likewise performed a body search on Alconde, from whom he recovered one (1) sachet containing 1.2347 grams of marijuana fruit tops.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Subsequently, the seized items were photographed only in the presence of accused-appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Not long after, accused-appellants were brought to the police station where the requisite marking and inventory were conducted by PO3 Agravante in the presence of accused-appellants and Barangay Captain Vivian Malingin (Brgy. Capt. Malingin).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The seized items were then delivered to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Puerto, Cagayan de Oro City wherein upon examination, tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu </i>and marijuana, both dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In his defense, Querquela denied the allegations against him, claiming that at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening of August 9, 2015, three (3) unidentified persons suddenly flagged him down and accosted him while he was on his way to the <i>habal-habal </i> terminal. Subsequently, the said men, who later on identified themselves as police officers, instructed him to bring them to his hut where Alconde was being interrogated. Afterwards, accused-appellants were brought to the Puerto Police Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>For his part, Alconde averred that at the time of the incident, he was simply sleeping in the hut of Querquela when an unknown person kicked the door open, pointed a gun at him, tied his hands with a rope, and brought him outside the hut. Thereafter, accused-appellants were brought to the police station, where Alconde was directed to hold one (1) small sachet of marijuana while a police officer took pictures of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated November 10, 2016, the RTC found accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged: <i>(a)</i> in Crim. Case No. CR-DRG-2015-414 for the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, Alconde was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for a period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to twenty (20) years, as maximum, and ordered to pay a fine of P300,000.00; and <i>(b)</i> in Crim. Case No. CR-DRG-2015-415 for the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, accused-appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and ordered to pay the amount of P500,000.00 each as fine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The RTC found the elements of the crimes of Illegal Possession and Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs to be present, as the same were duly proved in light of the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On the other hand, it rejected accused-appellants' defense of denial, for it failed to prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Aggrieved, accused-appellants appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to the CA.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated November 29, 2017, the CA affirmed <i>in toto</i> the RTC's ruling that accused-appellants are guilty of the crimes charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It ruled that the prosecution competently established all the elements of the crimes of Illegal Possession and Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. It likewise held that the chain of custody over the seized dangerous drugs was substantially complied with, as it was shown that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs had been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Meanwhile, it found that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the police officers did not actually detract from the truth and were thus too trivial to affect what was already proven by the prosecution, <i>i.e.,</i> the fact that accused-appellants acted in concert in selling <i>shabu</i> to PO3 Agravante.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld accused-appellants' conviction for the crimes charged.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti </i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquitta1.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter alia,</i> that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same, although jurisprudence recognized that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Pertinent to this case, <b>the law further requires that the said <u>inventory</u> and photography be done <u>in the presence of</u> the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as <u>certain required witnesses</u>,</b> namely: <i>(a)</i> if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> a representative from the media <i><u>AND</u></i> the Department of Justice, and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> or (b) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service <u><i>OR</i></u> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In this case, the inventory and photography of the seized items were not conducted in the presence of the required witnesses, namely: an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media. As the records show, the taking of photographs was immediately done upon the arrest but only in the presence of accused-appellants. It was only later when the police officers proceeded to the police precinct that a singular witness, Brgy. Capt. Malingin (an elected public official), was called to attend the marking and inventory of the confiscated items. Evidently, this procedure veers away from what is prescribed by law.<br><br>At this juncture, it is important to note that compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is because "[t]he law has been crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This notwithstanding, the Court has recognized that strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible due to varying field conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> As such, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the same would not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: <i>(a)</i> there is a justifiable ground for non-compliance; and <i>(b)</i> the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The foregoing is based on the saving clause found in Section 21 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, which was later adopted into the text of RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Anent the witness requirement, it is settled that non-compliance may be permitted if the prosecution proves that the apprehending officers exerted genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of such witnesses, albeit they eventually failed to appear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, however, no plausible explanation was given by the police officers as to why all the required witnesses were not around during the conduct of inventory and photography of the confiscated items. Neither was it shown that genuine and sufficient efforts were made to secure the presence of all the witnesses, as in fact, it was only "after the consummation of the buy-bust operation" when PO3 Agravante called Brgy. Capt. Malingin to witness the marking and inventory of the confiscated items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Thus, in view of this unjustified deviation from the chain of custody rule, the Court is constrained to conclude that the integrity and evidentiary value of the items purportedly seized from accused-appellants had been compromised, which consequently warrants their acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated November 29, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
