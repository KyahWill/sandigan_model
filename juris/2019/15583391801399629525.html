The Commission held:<br><blockquote>Without a doubt, an examination of the name REYNALDO S. ZAPANTA would disclose that the nickname "ALFRED" nowhere resembles the name of the Respondent. While the Respondent submitted affidavits of his two (2) witnesses attesting to the fact that he is known to be using "ALFRED" as his nickname, the same fails to persuade this Commission.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In the case, it is worthy to note that Petitioner is an incumbent Member of the City Council of Antipolo, Rizal, as such, it seems that he is known to the City as only ALFRED ZAPANTA. Thus, the inclusion of another candidate with strikingly the same name for the same position in the ballot will definitely sow confusion among the voters. Hence, the COC of Respondent is only meant to cause confusion among the voters by the similarity of his name appearing on the official ballot to that of the Petitioner, who is running for reelection.<br><br>The likelihood of confusion is apparent considering that Petitioner's preferred name to appear on the Official Ballot is ["ZAPANTA ALFRED J.,"] while Respondent is ["ZAPANTA ALFRED LAKAS."] Moreover, on the same premise, it likewise appears that Respondent has no <i>bona fide</i> intention to run for the office for which his COC has been filed.

He maintains that petitioner-intervenor was not duly elected; he merely benefited from petitioner's political tactics. Since he was never elected, petitioner-intervenor was not ousted from the position and his right to due process was not violated when he was not impleaded in the Nuisance Petition. Private respondent further contends that there is no provision under the Commission's Rules of Procedure that require him to implead any elected official who may be affected by his Petition. Nonetheless, petitioner-intervenor was accorded due process since he was given a copy of the Commission's August 8, 2017 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Lastly, private respondent argues that the August 8, 2017 Resolution became final and executory since no temporary restraining order was issued within five (5) days from petitioner's receipt of the Resolution's copy.

Since voters can cast more than one (1) vote for the position of city councilor, the nuisance candidate and the bona fide candidate may each receive a vote from a single voter. Thus, to add the votes cast for the nuisance candidate to the votes cast for the bona fide candidate would be erroneous, as this may result in the latter receiving two (2) votes from the same voter.

House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> this Court thoroughly discussed the reasons why nuisance candidates are abhorred:<br><blockquote>In controversies pertaining to nuisance candidates as in the case at bar, the law contemplates the likelihood of confusion which the similarity of surnames of two (2) candidates may generate. A nuisance candidate is thus defined as one who, based on the attendant circumstances, has no <i>bona fide</i> intention to run for the office for which the certificate of candidacy has been filed, his sole purpose being the reduction of the votes of a strong candidate, upon the expectation that ballots with only the surname of such candidate will be considered stray and not counted for either of them.<br><br>In elections for national positions such as President, Vice-President and Senator, the sheer logistical challenge posed by nuisance candidates gives compelling reason for the Commission to exercise its authority to eliminate nuisance candidates who obviously have no financial capacity or serious intention to mount a nationwide campaign. Thus we explained in <i>Pamatong v. Commission on Elections</i>:<br><blockquote>"The rationale behind the prohibition against nuisance candidates and the disqualification of candidates who have not evinced a <i>bona fide</i> intention to run for office is easy to divine. <b><i>The State has a compelling interest to ensure that its electoral exercises are rational, objective, and orderly.</i></b> Towards this end, the State takes into account the practical considerations in conducting elections. Inevitably, the greater the number of candidates, the greater the opportunities for logistical confusion, not to mention the increased allocation of time and resources in preparation for the election. These practical difficulties should, of course, never exempt the State from the conduct of a mandated electoral exercise. At the same time, remedial actions should be available to alleviate these logistical hardships, whenever necessary and proper. Ultimately, a disorderly election is not merely a textbook example of inefficiency, but a rot that erodes faith in our democratic institutions. . . . <br><br>. . . .<br><br>"The preparation of ballots is but one aspect that would be affected by allowance of "nuisance candidates" to run in the elections. Our election laws provide various entitlements for candidates for public office, such as watchers in every polling place, watchers in the board of canvassers, or even the receipt of electoral contributions. Moreover, there are election rules and regulations the formulations of which are dependent on the number of candidates in a given election.<br><br>"Given these considerations, the ignominious nature of a nuisance candidacy becomes even more galling. The organization of an election with <i>bona fide</i> candidates standing is onerous enough. To add into the mix candidates with no serious intentions or capabilities to run a viable campaign would actually impair the electoral process. . . .<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>Given the realities of elections in our country and particularly contests involving local positions, what emerges as the paramount concern in barring nuisance candidates from participating in the electoral exercise is the avoidance of confusion and frustration of the democratic process by preventing a faithful determination of the true will of the electorate, more than the practical considerations mentioned in <i>Pamatong</i>. A report published by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism in connection with the May 11, 1998 elections indicated that the tactic of fielding nuisance candidates with the same surnames as leading contenders had become one (1) "dirty trick" practiced in at least 18 parts of the country. The success of this clever scheme by political rivals or operators has been attributed to the last-minute disqualification of nuisance candidates by the Commission, notably its "slow-moving" decision-making.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, the names of petitioner and private respondent in the official ballots are indicated as follows:<br><blockquote>21. ZAPANTA, ALFRED (AKSYON)<br>22. ZAPANTA, ALFRED (LAKAS)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>The only way to distinguish petitioner from private respondent is their number on the ballot and their affiliations. Other than that, a voter who wanted to vote for "Alfred Zapanta," but only knows the name "Alfred" or surname "Zapanta," would be confused on which oval to shade to reflect his or her choice. No other candidate for the position of city councilor has either the name "Alfred" or "Zapanta."<br><br>After a perusal of the case records, this Court holds that petitioner was not able to sufficiently show that voters can clearly identify that his chosen nickname pertains only to him. The affidavits he presented are not enough to show that he had been using the name "Alfred" or that he is publicly known by that name.<br><br>Moreover, despite being given an opportunity to counter private respondent's allegations, petitioner failed to deny that he had no campaign materials using the name "Alfred Zapanta," or present evidence to the contrary. He merely banked on his membership in a political party to support his claim that he had a bona fide intention to run for office. Association to a political party per se does not necessarily equate to a candidate's bona fide intent; instead, he or she must show that he or she is serious in running for office. This, petitioner failed to demonstrate.<br><br>Additionally, private respondent is more recognized by his constituents as "Alfred Zapanta," being an incumbent city councilor who was running for another term.<br><br>This Court further holds that public respondent's order of adding petitioner's votes to private respondent's votes is not tainted with grave abuse of discretion. However, its ruling on this issue must be set aside.<br><br>In <i>David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><blockquote>The term "grave abuse of discretion" has been generally held to refer to such arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical exercise of judgment as is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>[T]he abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough: it must be grave.<br></blockquote>There is grave abuse of discretion when a constitutional organ such as the Senate Electoral Tribunal or the Commission on Elections, makes manifestly gross errors in its factual inferences such that critical pieces of evidence, which have been nevertheless properly introduced by a party, or admitted, or which were the subject of stipulation, are ignored or not accounted for.<br><br>A glaring misinterpretation of the constitutional text or of statutory provisions, as well as a misreading or misapplication of the current state of jurisprudence, is also considered grave abuse of discretion. The arbitrariness consists in the disregard of the current state of our law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Public respondent explained that it based its ruling on <i>Dela Cruz</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> where this Court held that the votes for the nuisance candidate should be added to the votes for the bona fide candidate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Despite involving a single-slot office, where only one (1) candidate can win for the position, public respondent applied <i>Dela Cruz</i> as it was the prevailing doctrine when it decided on this case. More, there were then no rules or jurisprudence dealing with the votes of a nuisance candidate in a multi-slot office.<br><br>This Court finds that public respondent did not exercise its judgment in an arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical manner when it ordered adding the votes cast for petitioner to the votes cast for private respondent. On the contrary, it merely applied "the current state of our law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>With the recent promulgation of <i>Santos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> this Court clarified how the votes of nuisance candidates in a multi-slot office should be treated:<br><blockquote>In a multi-slot office, such as membership of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i>, a registered voter may vote for more than one candidate. Hence, it is possible that the legitimate candidate and nuisance candidate, having similar names, may both receive votes in one ballot. The Court agrees with the OSG that in that scenario, the vote cast for the nuisance candidate should no longer be credited to the legitimate candidate; otherwise, the latter shall receive two votes from one voter.<br><br>Therefore, in a multi-slot office, the COMELEC must not merely apply a simple mathematical formula of adding the votes of the nuisance candidate to the legitimate candidate with the similar name. To apply such simple arithmetic might lead to the double counting of votes because there may be ballots containing votes for both nuisance and legitimate candidates.<br><br>As properly discussed by the OSG, a legitimate candidate may seek another person with the same surname to file a candidacy for the same position and the latter will opt to be declared a nuisance candidate. In that scenario, the legitimate candidate shall receive all the votes of the nuisance candidate and may even receive double votes, thereby, drastically increasing his odds.<br><br>At the same time, it is also possible that a voter may be confused when he reads the ballot containing the similar names of the nuisance candidate and the legitimate candidate. In his eagerness to vote, he may shade both ovals for the two candidates to ensure that the legitimate candidate is voted for. Similarly, in that case, the legitimate candidate may receive two (2) votes from one voter by applying the simple arithmetic formula adopted by the COMELEC when the nuisance candidate's COC is cancelled.<br><br>Thus, to ascertain that the votes for the nuisance candidate is accurately credited in favor of the legitimate candidate with the similar name, the COMELEC must also inspect the ballots. In those ballots that contain both votes for nuisance and legitimate candidate, only one count of vote must be credited to the legitimate candidate.<br><br>While the perils of a fielding nuisance candidates against legitimate candidates cannot be overemphasized, it must also be guaranteed that the votes of the nuisance candidate are properly and fairly counted in favor of the said legitimate candidate. In that manner, the will of the electorate is upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, the <i>Santos</i> doctrine must be applied: the votes for petitioner alone should be counted in favor of private respondent; if there are votes for both petitioner and private respondent in the same ballot, then only one (1) vote should be counted in the latter's favor. This will not only discourage nuisance candidates, but will also prevent the disenfranchisement of voters.<br><br>On the third issue, petitioner-intervenor contends that he was denied his right to due process since he was not impleaded in the Nuisance Petition, nor was he furnished with public respondent's processes or private respondent's pleadings.<br><br>The legal standing of unaffected candidates in a nuisance petition has already been settled in <i>Santos</i>:<br><blockquote>The Court finds that in a petition for disqualification of a nuisance candidate, the only real parties in interest are the alleged nuisance candidate, the affected legitimate candidate, whose names are similarly confusing. A real [party-in-interest] is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.<br><br>In <i>Timbol v. COMELEC (Timbol)</i>, it was stated that to minimize the logistical confusion caused by nuisance candidates, their COC may be denied due course or cancelled by the petition of a legitimate candidate or by the COMELEC. This denial or cancellation may be <i>motu proprio</i> or upon a verified petition of an interested party, subject to an opportunity to be heard. It was emphasized therein that the COMELEC should balance its duty to ensure that the electoral process is clean, honest, orderly, and peaceful with the right of an alleged nuisance candidate to explain his or her <i>bona fide</i> intention to run for public office before he or she is declared a nuisance candidate.<br><br>Thus, when a verified petition for disqualification of a nuisance candidate is filed, the real parties-in-interest are the alleged nuisance candidate and the interested party, particularly, the legitimate candidate. Evidently, the alleged nuisance candidate and the legitimate candidate stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit. The outcome of the nuisance case shall directly affect the number of votes of the legitimate candidate, specifically, whether the votes of the nuisance candidate should be credited in the former's favor.<br><br>Glaringly, there was nothing discussed in <i>Timbol</i> that other candidates, who do not have any similarity with the name of the alleged nuisance candidate, are real parties-in-interest or have the opportunity to be heard in a nuisance petition. Obviously, these other candidates are not affected by the nuisance case because their names are not related with the alleged nuisance candidate. <b>Regardless of whether the nuisance petition is granted or not, the votes of the unaffected candidates shall be completely the same.</b> Thus, they are mere silent observers in the nuisance case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>As a mere observer, petitioner-intervenor is not required to be impleaded in the Nuisance Petition. Hence, his right to due process could not have been violated. Records also show that petitioner-intervenor did not deny private respondent's allegation that it received a copy of public respondent's August 8, 2017 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Despite receipt, petitioner-intervenor did not take action to protect his interest.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the August 31, 2017 Writ of Execution of public respondent Commission on Elections En Banc in SPA Case No. 15-212 (DC) is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>, as follows:<br><ol><li><b>RE-CONVENE</b> the Special Board of Canvassers of Antipolo City to re-canvass the votes for the position of Members of the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> of the Second District of Antipolo City;<br><br></li><li><b>COUNT</b> the votes for Reynaldo S.
