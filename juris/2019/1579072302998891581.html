Although the parties entered into mediation before the <i>Lupong Tagapamayapa, </i>they failed to settle amicably.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>This impelled petitioner to file an <i>accion reinvindicatoria </i>with prayer for a temporary restraining order and damages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> before the MTC.<br><br><center><b>The MTC Ruling</b></center><br><br>In her complaint, petitioner, under claim of ownership by virtue of the Deeds of Absolute Sale and Reconveyance and the TCT in her name, prayed that respondents be ordered to vacate the property so that she could cultivate it herself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> For their part, respondents lamented that the sale was void under Section 118 of Commonwealth Act (C.A.)

As the sale was perfected prior to the registration and titling of the property, the MTC held that the same was not prohibited under Section 118 of C.A. No. 141. It pointed out that the approval of Enrique, Sr.'s free patent application and the issuance of the OCT in his name were conclusive proof of his ownership from which petitioner derives her right. It declared the OCT indefeasible and imprescriptible, and not subject to collateral attack in the instant action for recovery of possession but rather in a direct proceeding assailing its validity. In the same vein, it held that questions as to the validity of the Deed of Reconveyance and the consequent deprivation of the other heirs of their share by virtue thereof, must likewise be resolved in the proper forum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff and against the defendants and hereby ORDERS (sic):<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(i) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">defendants and any and all persons acting under them and in their behalf to vacate the subject property described as Lot No. 2926 Pls-570 located at Leron, Buguey, Cagayan and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-134942 and surrender the possession of the same to the plaintiff;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(ii)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">defendants to pay plaintiff reasonable rent in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) per annum from December 2002 up to the time they actually vacate the subject property;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(iii) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">defendants to pay plaintiff moral damages in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00);</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(iv)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">defendants to pay plaintiff litigation expenses and attorney's fees in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00); and,</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">(v)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Cost against defendants[.] </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b></center><br><br>The RTC, in its April 21, 2014 Decision, affirmed the findings and conclusion of the MTC as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, </b>premises considered, the Decision of the Municipal Trial Court, Buguey, Cagayan dated August 27, 2013, appealed from is <b>AFFIRMED </b><i><b>IN TOTO.</b></i><br><br><b>[SO ORDERED].</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></center><br><br>Disagreeing with the rulings below, the CA held that the waiver, the Deed of Absolute Sale and the Deed of Confirmation of Sale were all inconsequential because they were executed pending approval of the free patent application, as in fact they were not annotated on the OCT. With that, the Deed of Reconveyance, executed after the issuance of the OCT, was likewise ineffective and not binding because any alienation or encumbrance of the property is proscribed under the terms of Section 118 of C.A. No. 141. Accordingly, it declared petitioner's TCT as null and void, and the OCT in Enrique, Sr.'s name, valid and subsisting as follows:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the Petition for Review is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.

No. 141 does not apply to a sale made prior to the approval of the patent application supposedly because the prohibition applies only from the approval of the application and for five years from the date of the issuance of the patent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Section 118 states:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 118. </b>Except in favor of the Government or any of its branches, units, or institutions, <b>lands acquired under free patent or homestead provisions shall not be subject to encumbrance or alienation from the date of the approval of the application and for a term of five years from and after the date of issuance of the patent or grant, </b>nor shall they become liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the expiration of said period, but the improvements or crops on the land may be mortgaged or pledged to qualified persons, associations, or corporations.<br><br>No alienation, transfer, or conveyance of any homestead after five years and before twenty-five years after issuance of title shall be valid without the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, which approval shall not be denied except on constitutional and legal grounds. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The proscription against the sale or encumbrance of property subject of a pending free patent application is not pointedly found in the aforequoted provision. Rather, it is embodied in the regalian doctrine enshrined in the Constitution, which declares all lands of the public domain as belonging to the State, and are beyond the commerce of man and not susceptible of private appropriation and acquisitive prescription.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> What divests the Government of its title to the land is the issuance of the patent and its subsequent registration in the Office of the Register of Deeds. Such registration is the operative act that would bind the land and convey its ownership to the applicant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It is then that the land is segregated from the mass of public domain, converting it into private property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In property law, fundamental is the principle that no one can give what he does not have.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In other words, a seller may sell only what he or she owns, or that which he does not own but has authority to transfer, and a buyer can acquire only what the seller can legally transfer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In fact, the Civil Code states that in a contract of sale, the seller binds himself to transfer the ownership of the thing sold,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and to do so, he must have the right to convey ownership of the thing at the time it is delivered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The thing must be licit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Based on these precepts, the contested lot in this case, during the pendency of the free patent application, was still part of the public domain and, therefore, an illicit subject of a contract of sale between Enrique, Sr. and petitioner. At the time, Enrique, Sr. did not have the right to transfer ownership inasmuch as he merely had an inchoate right as a patent applicant. By lodging an application for free patent, he had thereby acknowledged and recognized the land to be part of the public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> His application is an unmistakable recognition of his non-ownership of the subject land, such that his waiver of rights and the execution of the subsequent Deed of Absolute Sale – both in favor of petitioner – only suggest bad faith on his part for violating the condition of the sworn application that the same is for his exclusive benefit alone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Indeed, the fact that the OCT was later issued in his name is an affirmation that the state will award homestead lots only to the person in whose name the application was filed and to no one else.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court affirmed the nullification of a mortgage on a piece of public land constituted during the pendency of the free patent application therefor. In holding that the petitioner bank did not acquire valid title as mortgagee under the deed of mortgage, the open, continuous and public possession of the land by the mortgagor for thirty 30 years did not change the character of the land as still being part of the public domain prior to the issuance of the patent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <i>Visayan Realty v. Meer</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> pointed out that the grant of a sales application merely authorizes the applicant to take possession of the land so that he could comply with the requirements prescribed by law before a final patent can be issued in his favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Before these requirements shall have been complied with, <i>Javier v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> emphasizes that the Government still remains the owner of the property, as in fact the application could still be cancelled and the land awarded to another applicant should it be shown that the legal requirements had not been complied with.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Upon this disquisition and on the basis of Section 118 in relation to Section 124<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of C.A. No. 141 did the Court, in <i>Egao v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> invalidate two sale transactions involving portions of a homestead lot – one entered into by petitioner therein during pendency of the application and the other, after issuance of the free patent but within the 5-year ban on encumbrance and alienation. There, the Court upheld the petitioner's OCT in spite of the contracts of sale which were perfected prior to the approval of the patent application and during the prohibitory period and therefore null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On this note, the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that the Deed of Reconveyance, upon which petitioner's TCT was issued, is void and ineffective in transferring rights to her as it involved a prohibited alienation under Section 118 of C.A. No. 141. It is clear at this juncture that petitioner's TCT is a nullity, yet petitioner now objects to the competence of the Court of Appeals in declaring it so. She posits that by handing down a ruling on the validity of her title, the appellate court has thereby sanctioned an impermissible attack on a Torrens title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioner is mistaken.<br><br><i>Accion reinvindicatoria, </i>or an action for reconveyance, is a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful owner of a land which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another for the purpose of compelling the latter to transfer or reconvey the land to him. The action does not seek to reopen the registration proceedings and to set aside the decree of registration but only purports to show that the person who secured the registration of the property in controversy is not the real owner thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In this action, the decree of registration is respected as incontrovertible, but what is sought instead is the transfer of the property, wrongfully or erroneously registered, in another's name, to its rightful owner or to one with a better right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Indeed, Section 48<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 1529<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> bars a collateral attack to a certificate of title and allows only a direct attack. An attack is direct when the object of the action is to annul or set aside such proceeding or enjoin its enforcement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Conversely, an attack is indirect or collateral when, in an action to obtain a different relief, an attack on the proceeding is nevertheless made as an incident thereof. Such action to attack a certificate of title may be an original action or a counterclaim, in which a certificate of title is assailed as void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>There is no obstacle to the determination of the validity of petitioner's TCT in the instant case. While the indefeasibility of a Torrens title may not be collaterally attacked, it bears to stress that the underlying complaint originated from the MTC as an action for reconveyance filed by petitioner against herein respondents, and not an original action filed by the latter to question the validity of the TCT on which petitioner anchors her claim. Thus, although a ruling on the validity of the title may constitute a collateral attack, it must be emphasized that respondents, in their answer to the complaint, have put forth a counterclaim of ownership over the subject property along with a claim for damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, therefore, may competently rule – as in fact it did – on the validity of petitioner's title for the counterclaim to be considered a direct attack on the same. This is based on the well-settled principle that a counterclaim is essentially a complaint filed by the defendant against the plaintiff and stands on the same footing as an independent action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> As plaintiffs in their own counterclaim, respondents are entitled to an opportunity to prove their cause of action and establish their rights like the petitioner in the original complaint.<br><br>In sum, the Court finds that the sale made by Enrique, Sr. in favor of petitioner during the pendency of his free patent application is void and did not produce legal effect. As petitioner has not derived valid title from the said transaction, the Deed of Reconveyance in her favor and the TCT that was eventually issued could also not have placed her in ownership of the subject property. Indeed, the definite state policy which our public land laws seek to promote is to keep in the family of the homesteader that portion of the public land which the state has gratuitously given to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>That the alienation of the property in this case was made in favor of the applicant's own heir no less, and before the issuance of the patent applied for, is, to our mind of no moment. A validation of arrangements of this kind would only open the door to fraudulent schemes that enable the means to circumvent the law. Thus, it was held in <i>Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Section 118 of the Public Land Act reads: "Except in favor of the Government or any of its branches, units, or institutions, or legally constituted banking corporations, lands acquired under the free patent or homestead provisions shall not be subject to encumbrance or alienation from the date of the approval of the application and for a term of five years from and after the date of issuance of the patent or grant, nor shall they become liable to the satisfaction of any debt contracted prior to the expiration of said period; but the improvements or crops of the land may be mortgaged or pledged to qualified persons, associations, or corporations." Is it not a clear expression then of the state policy to assure that the original grantee, even if he were minded otherwise, is deprived for a period of five years of his freedom of disposition? Thus is he protected from his own weaknesses or temptation to sell, or lack of business acumen, the purpose being, in the language of Justice <i>J.B.L. Reyes in Artates v. Urbi, </i>to keep and preserve for him "or his family the land given to him gratuitously by the State, so that being a property owner, he may become and remain a contented and useful member of our society." <b>Considering that such is policy, does it not logically follow that he is precluded disposing of his rights prior even to his obtaining the patent? Both policy and reason, therefore, unite in conclusion that no such distinction should be made. Then, it is not to be forgotten that the state is possessed of plenary power as the </b><i><b>persona </b></i><b>in law to determine who shall be the favored recipients of public lands, as well as under what terms they may be granted such privilege, not excluding placing of obstacles in the way of their exercising what otherwise would be ordinary acts of ownership?</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Petition is <b>DENIED. </b>The October 23, 2015 Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
