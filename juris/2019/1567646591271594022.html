It further directed that the concerned government offices be furnished a copy of the said Order and the same be published in a newspaper of general circulation for three (3) consecutive weeks at the expense of petitioner. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>During the scheduled hearing, petitioner established the jurisdictional requirement&nbsp; of publication, which was admitted by the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Ifugao, the office duly deputized to assist the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) in the proceedings.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[12]</sup></font> An order of general default was issued and petitioner was then allowed to present his evidence<i> ex-parte</i> before the Clerk of Court of the RTC.

Assuming that his original or first registration contains several errors, such do not constitute valid grounds for the cancellation thereof, and the proper remedy is to file a petition for correction of entries in the first registration under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court (Rule 108).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated February 1, 2018, the CA annulled and set aside the RTC ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It ruled that there can be no valid late registration of petitioner's birth considering that the same had already been lawfully registered with the LCR-Aguinaldo within thirty (30) days from the time of his birth,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as required under Office of the Civil Registrar-General Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1983.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, it held that the RTC should have upheld the validity of petitioner's <i>first</i> birth certificate instead of his <i>second</i> birth certificate, which should have been the.one nullified and cancelled. It declared that the proper remedy was to file a petition for correction of entries in petitioner's <i>first</i> birth certificate pursuant to Rule 108.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; moved for&nbsp; reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; which was denied&nbsp; in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated May 16, 2018; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The issue for the Court's&nbsp; resolution&nbsp; is whether or not the CA committed reversible error when it annulled and set aside the RTC ruling ordering the cancellation of petitioner's <i>first</i> birth certificate.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>Under Office of the Civil Registrar-General Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1983, as amended, the birth of a child shall be registered within 30 days from the time of birth in the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of the city/municipality where it occurred. In this case, petitioner's birth had already been reported by his mother, Antonia Maingit (Antonia), and duly recorded in the civil register of the LCR-Aguinaldo on June 13, 1986. Thus, as correctly pointed out by the CA, there can be no valid late registration of petitioner's birth as the same had already been lawfully registered within 30 days from his birth under the <i>first</i> birth certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, it is the <i>second</i> birth certificate that should be declared void and correspondingly cancelled even if the entries therein are claimed to be the correct ones.<br><br>However, while the petition specifically prayed for the cancellation of petitioner's <i>first</i> birth certificate&nbsp; and the retention&nbsp; of his <i>second</i> birth certificate,&nbsp; the <u>ultimate objective</u>&nbsp; was to correct the erroneous&nbsp; entries pertaining to petitioner's first and last names, <i>i.e</i>., from Matron Ohoma to Matiorico Ohomna, as he claimed that people in the community know him by the latter name rather than the former.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Rule 108 implements judicial proceedings for the correction or cancellation of entries in the civil registry pursuant to Article 412<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the Civil Code. The role of the Court under Rule 108 is to ascertain the truth about the facts recorded therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The action filed by petitioner before the RTC seeks to correct a supposedly misspelled name, and thus, properly falls under Rule 108. To correct simply means "to make or set aright; to remove the faults or error from."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Considering that petitioner complied with the procedural requirements<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> under Rule 108, the RTC had the jurisdiction to resolve the petition which included a prayer for "[o]ther reliefs just and equitable x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> A general prayer for "other reliefs just and equitable" appearing on a petition enables the court to award reliefs supported by the complaint or other pleadings, by the facts admitted at the trial, and by the evidence adduced by the parties, even if these reliefs are not specifically prayed for in the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Consequently, the CA erred in holding that petitioner has to refile another petition before the trial court could resolve his claim.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court finds that petitioner failed to sufficiently establish that his father's last name was Ohomna and not Ohoma through competent evidence, <i>i.e</i>., the latter's birth certificate, the certificate of his marriage to petitioner's mother, Antonia, on January 30, 1986, or a government-issued identification card or record. On this score alone, the correction of petitioner's first and last names should be denied. While the first name may be freely selected by the parents for the child, the last name to which the child is entitled is fixed by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Although petitioner's Elementary School Permanent Record<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; and Professional Driver's License<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> identify him as Matiorico Ohomna, the same are insufficient to grant the petition.&nbsp; It pears stressing that the real name of a person is that given him in the Civil Register, not the name by which he was baptized in his Church or by which he was known in the community, or which he has adopted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In addition, the Court notes that Antonia was the informant in both instances and the one who signed both birth certificates.&nbsp; However, a perusal of Antonia's signatures on petitioner's two (2) birth certificates shows that the same are materially different from each other.&nbsp; Further, petitioner failed to show any plausible explanation why she signed as Antonia Ohoma<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> on the first birth certificate and as Antonia Ohomna<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  on the second birth certificate.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>,&nbsp; the petition is&nbsp; <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated February 1, 2018 and the Resolution dated May 16, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
