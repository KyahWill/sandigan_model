Castillo (PCI Castillo), were at their office when a confidential in­formant arrived and told them that <i>alias</i> Gerald was the most notorious pusher of illegal drugs at Villa Evangelista St., Bolante 2, Barangay Palatiw, Pasig City. Based on this information, PCI Castillo formed an entrapment team to conduct a buy-bust operation. PO1&nbsp; Rodrigo J. Nidoy, Jr. (PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr.) was assigned as poseur-buyer and PO1&nbsp; Jonathan B. Bueno (PO1&nbsp; Bueno) was as­ signed as back-up. PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr. received two P100.00 bills as buy-bust money, which he marked with his initials "RJN." The SAID-SOTG buy-bust team submitted a Coordination&nbsp; Sheet and Pre-Operation&nbsp; Form to the Eastern Police District Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operation Task Group and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Around 2:20 am of July 19, 2015, the buy-bust team and the confidential informant proceeded&nbsp; to Villa Evangelista St. While walking along said street, the confidential&nbsp; informant pointed to PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr., Gerald's&nbsp; house. PO1 Bueno was discreetly following them. They saw accused-appellants standing in front of the house. The confidential informant whispered to PO1 Nidoy, Jr. that these were Gerald's cohorts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The confidential informant and PO1 Nidoy, Jr. approached accused-appellants and looked for Gerald because they wanted to buy shabu. After in­ forming them that Gerald just left,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Mamarinta asked them how much they wanted to buy. PO1 Nidoy, Jr. replied <i>"dos</i> <i>lang"</i> and brought out the buy-bust money which Batuan received. Mamarinta then brought out four transparent plastic sachets&nbsp; containing&nbsp; white crystalline substance,&nbsp; which appears to be shabu, and placed it on his palm. Mamarinta gave one sachet&nbsp; to PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>PO1 Nidoy, Jr. then executed the pre-arranged signal by scratching his head. PO1 Bueno then closed in on the crime scene. PO1 Nidoy, Jr. introduced himself as a police officer, arrested Mamarinta, and confiscated from him the three other sachets. As for PO1 Bueno, he likewise introduced&nbsp; himself as a police officer, arrested Batuan, and ordered him to bring out the contents of his pocket. Batuan&nbsp; brought out from his pocket the buy-bust&nbsp; money and a heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance. PO1 Bueno confiscated the items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>While they were still in the place of arrest, PO1 Nidoy, Jr. marked the sachets he received and confiscated from Mamarinta in front of the latter. PO1 Bueno likewise marked the sachet he confiscated from Batuan. They summoned representatives&nbsp; from the media and <i>barangay</i> elected officials. However, it was only <i>Barangay </i> <i>Kagawad</i> Chester&nbsp; Guevarra <i>(Brgy.</i> <i>Kgwd.</i> Guevarra) who arrived. PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr. and PO1&nbsp; Bueno presented accused-appel­lants and the evidence against them to <i>Brgy.</i> <i>Kgwd.</i> Guevarra, and explained the circumstances of their arrest. PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr. and PO1&nbsp; Bueno prepared the inventory&nbsp; of the seized&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; in front&nbsp; of accused-appellants and&nbsp; <i>Brgy.

PSI Vicente examined the contents of the sachets and found that all tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants pleaded&nbsp; not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Mamarinta&nbsp; claimed&nbsp; that&nbsp; he was inside his house in Villa Evangelista St. and was putting his child to sleep when armed men barged in and asked him if he was Gerald. Despite answering in the negative, his hands were tied with a plastic rope and he was brought to the police station via a tricycle. It was only at the police station that he met Batuan. When he was subjected to an inquest, he finally discovered what was being charged against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Batuan testified that he was at a store along Villa Evangelista St. when armed men asked him if he was Gerald and arrested him.

With respect to the chain of custody, the RTC ruled that it was unbroken since the marking of the sachets, the preparation of the inventory of the seized evidence, and the taking of photographs were all done in the presence of accused-appellants&nbsp; and while they were still in the place of the arrest.&nbsp; <i>Brgy. </i> <i>Kgwd. </i> Guevarra&nbsp; was&nbsp; also&nbsp; present&nbsp; during&nbsp; the inventory of the seized evidence.

The CA agreed with the RTC that the chain of custody requirement was substantially complied with. <i>First,</i> the absence of a&nbsp; representative&nbsp; from the media was duly explained&nbsp; by PO1 Nidoy, Jr. and PO1 Bueno, who testified that they made extra efforts to contact a media representative, but no one came because the operation was carried out during an unholy hour, <i>i.e.,</i> 2:20 a.m. <i>Second,</i> the CA held that the presence of a representative from the National Prosecution Service (NPS) during the inventory-taking does not apply because the guidelines became the implementing&nbsp; rules and regulations (IRR) of R.A. 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> amending R.A. 9165, took effect on July 30, 2015, after the operation was conducted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Third, </i>The CA ruled that the non-presentation of PSI Vicente is not a sufficient ground to find a break in the chain of custody since her testimony was dispensed with because accused-appellants' counsel and the prosecution&nbsp; had agreed to a stipulation of facts, among which is that she received the specimens and can identify her report&nbsp; on it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In addition, PSI Vicente is a public officer whose reports carry the presumption of regularity. <i>Fourth,</i> the prosecution's failure to establish that the confiscated items were placed in a sealed container or evidence bag is a negligible omission, considering that PO1 Nidoy, Jr. and PO1 Bueno were the only ones who had its custody from the time they confiscated the items until they turned it over to PSI Vicente.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants thus filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated August 16, 2018.

Thus, the rule laid down in Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. 10640, must be strictly observed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the ruling of the CA, R.A. 10640 applies in this case since the law became effective on July 23, 2014<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and the operation took place on July 19, 2015.

Gamboa,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> We reiterated that the prosecution must explain the reason for the procedural&nbsp; lapses and that the&nbsp; justifiable&nbsp; ground&nbsp; for&nbsp; non-compliance must&nbsp; be proven&nbsp; as a fact.&nbsp; With respect&nbsp; to the absence&nbsp; of the required&nbsp; witnesses,&nbsp; the prosecution must show that the apprehending officers&nbsp; exerted genuine and sufficient&nbsp; efforts to secure their&nbsp; presence.&nbsp; Mere statements&nbsp; of&nbsp; unavailability are&nbsp; insufficient to justify non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In this case, the only witness present during the conduct of the inventory in this case was <i>Brgy.</i> <i>Kgwd.</i> Guevarra.&nbsp; According to the CA, PO1 Nidoy, Jr. and PO1 Bueno both testified that they made an effort to contact a media representative but to no avail.&nbsp; During&nbsp; his cross examination, PO1&nbsp; Nidoy, Jr. said&nbsp; that&nbsp; it was a certain&nbsp; PO2 Santos&nbsp; who called&nbsp; a representative from the media. He saw PO2 Santos call the media but he could no longer recall exactly who from the media was contacted.&nbsp; No one arrived&nbsp; because of the time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As for PO1 Bueno,&nbsp; he claimed&nbsp; in his re-direct&nbsp; examination that it was the chief of&nbsp; SAID&nbsp; who&nbsp; called&nbsp; through&nbsp; a&nbsp; cellphone&nbsp; the&nbsp; representative&nbsp; from&nbsp; the Department of Justice&nbsp; (DOJ)&nbsp; and the media. Only&nbsp; <i>Brgy. Kgwd.</i> Guevarra arrived.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>In&nbsp; <i>People&nbsp; v. Jodan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> We held that when the person himself&nbsp; who contacted the representative from the media or the DOJ was not presented as a witness, the testimony of the other witnesses on this point is hearsay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Therefore, the CA erred in relying on the statements of PO1 Nidoy, Jr. and PO1 Bueno with respect to the alleged phone call made to the representatives of the media and the DOJ or the National Prosecution Service (NPS). They had no personal knowledge of the same and were not qualified to testify on the matter. Notably, both PO1 Nidoy, Jr. and PO1 Bueno did not mention whether the representative from the&nbsp; NPS&nbsp; was available,&nbsp; thus&nbsp; giving the impression that no attempt was made to secure the latter's presence. Aside from that, they did not testify how many times they tried to contact the representatives&nbsp; or&nbsp; whether they&nbsp; tried to coordinate with them&nbsp; prior&nbsp; to conducting the operation. In <i>People</i>&nbsp; <i>v.</i> <i>Misa,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> We ruled that "the apprehending officers could not reasonably expect that a representative of the NPS or the media would just be readily available for the conduct of inventory (and photography) at a mere moment's notice, much less at the officers' beck and call."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> That being the case, the prosecution failed to prove that they exerted genuine efforts in securing the presence of the required witnesses. Their&nbsp; non-compliance with Section 21 of&nbsp; R.A. 9165,&nbsp; as&nbsp; amended,&nbsp; is inexcusable. In <i>People v. Miranda,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; We held that "the procedure in Section 21 of [R.A.] 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the acquittal of accused­ appellants is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
