By doing so, Plast-Print necessarily placed the assets securing these financial accommodations under the SEC's special jurisdiction. Considering that the SEC already acquired jurisdiction over the financial accommodations and securities subject of Plast-Print's subsequent RTC Complaint, the RTC erred when it proceeded to act on it while the SEC Petition remained pending.<br><br>To stress, jurisdiction, once acquired is not lost, and continues until the case is terminated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, in cases where, as here, a petition for suspension of payments is filed before the SEC, it acquires jurisdiction over the action and all matters relating thereto to the exclusion of the RTC.<br><br>Seemingly cognizant of the RTC's lack of jurisdiction, Plast-Print and Dequito alternatively claim that the issue of the RTC's jurisdiction had been settled by the CA with finality when it resolved RCBC's petition for<i> certiorari</i> in this wise:<br><blockquote>"[The RTC] correctly ruled that [it] had jurisdiction over the questioned case since the principal action before [it] was not the suspension of payments] under the jurisdiction of the [SEC], but that of the annulment and cancellation of the [S]heriff s certificate in the foreclosure proceedings over which [the RTC] had jurisdiction.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In <i>Macapalan v.
