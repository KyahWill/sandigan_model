However, Nutri-Asia refused to pay for the goods delivered from December 29, 2007 to January 22, 2009 after their payment became due, despite oral and written demands from Hygienic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Hygienic prayed that Nutri-Asia be ordered to pay it the sum of: (1) P9,737,674.62 plus 12% interest per annum as the total unpaid cost of the plastic containers; (2) 25% of P9,737,674.62 or the amount to be collected from Nutri-Asia as attorney's fees; (3) P300,000.00 as their counsel's acceptance fee; (4) P4,000.00 as their counsel's appearance fee for each and every appearance of its counsel in court; and (5) costs of suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In its Answer with Compulsory Counter-Claim,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Nutri-Asia argued that the case should be dismissed as Hygienic failed to comply with a condition precedent prior to its filing of the Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It claimed that under the Terms and Conditions of the Purchase Orders, Hygienic should have first referred the matter to the Arbitration Committee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Nutri-Asia alleged that the venue was also improperly laid since the Regional Trial Court of Manila was not the proper venue for the institution of Hygienic's personal action. The Complaint should have been filed either before the trial courts of San Pedro, Laguna or Pasig City, where the principal places of business of Hygienic and Nutri-Asia are located, respectively. The venue of actions as stated in the Sales Invoices could not bind Nutri-Asia since it did not give its express conformity to that stipulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Nutri-Asia admitted purchasing the plastic containers, and receiving Hygienic's Demand Letter and Final Demand Letter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> However, it countered that Hygienic's claim "has been extinguished on the ground of compensation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Nutri-Asia claimed that of the 457,128 plastic containers, it only used 327,046 for its products, while the 130,082 pieces were unused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It narrated that since January 21, 2009, it received numerous customer complaints on its UFC Banana Catsup products.

Hygienic's officers allegedly assured Nutri-Asia representatives that Hygienic will shoulder the expenses that would be incurred in the recall of the contaminated products. Its Sales and Marketing Manager, Judith B. Lim, allegedly reassured the same in an electronic mail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Nutri-Asia further stated that it sent a Letter dated May 6, 2009 to Hygienic, requesting for the reimbursement of P36,304,451.27, representing the recall expenses, product and container costs, freight and rental charges, and brand damage. This amount excludes Nutri-Asia's unrealized income.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Nutri-Asia disclosed that Hygienic, in its June 9, 2009 letter, stated that it could not assess Nutri-Asia's claims as they were not accompanied by any supporting document. It also said that it would consider the case closed if Nutri-Asia failed to provide supporting documents by the end of June 11, 2009 office hours. Nutri-Asia replied that Hygienic had no basis to consider the matter closed since the former did not abandon or waive its reimbursement claim. Nutri-Asia requested for a meeting to further discuss the matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Nutri-Asia alleged that it sent Hygienic the supporting documents on June 15, 2009. However, Hygienic stated that the documents it received were insufficient to support Nutri-Asia's reimbursement claim. Nutri-Asia insisted that the documents were sufficient, and again suggested a meeting between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>After a re-computation of its claims, Nutri-Asia informed Hygienic that its request for reimbursement decreased to P25,850,759.31. The new amount was due to the reduction of the number of rejects and the reduction in freight charges, rental charges, and additional manpower charges. The parties exchanged several correspondences, until Nutri-Asia received a copy of the Complaint.

The arbitration clause was merely an offer from Nutri-Asia, which Hygienic rejected in its Sales Invoices. To submit the dispute to arbitration, there should have been an unequivocal agreement between the parties. This agreement was lacking in their case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In its May 24, 2010 Order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Regional Trial Court Branch 46, Manila denied the Omnibus Motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It held that the venue was properly laid.

It held that Hygienic and Nutri-Asia were not creditors and debtors of each other. Only Hygienic was the creditor, and only Nutri-Asia was the debtor. Nutri-Asia's Counter-Claim for damages still had to be proven.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The trial court likewise did not give credence to Nutri-Asia's allegation that Hygienic had no cause of action against it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> As to the allegation that Nutri-Asia's affirmative defenses could already be resolved without going through trial, the trial court held that the issues Nutri-Asia raised "must be heard in a full blown trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It held:<br><blockquote>It is the view of the court that the arguments presented are factual in nature. Trial therefore is essential for the court to best appreciate the facts presented. It cannot be done by mere reading, study and evaluation of the documents attached to the complaint and the arguments presented in their respective motions and comments to prevent miscarriage of justice.<br><br>....<br><br>[Rule 16, Section 6 of the Rules of Civil Procedure] provides that it is discretionary upon the court to conduct a preliminary hearing on the affirmative defenses as a ground for dismissal.<br><br>Considering therefore that it is discretionary upon the court to allow the hearing on special and affirmative defenses[,] this court would rather conduct a full blown trial so it could evaluate the respective issues raised by the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court ruled that Nutri-Asia's Counter-Claim was permissive in nature; thus, it could not acquire jurisdiction over the Counter-Claim unless the filing fees were paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court's May 24, 2010 Order read:<br><blockquote>Considering the above premises, the Omnibus Motion is hereby denied.<br><br>Defendant is directed to pay the appropriate docket fees on its permissive counterclaim within thirty (30) days from receipt of this order.<br><br>Let the pre-trial of the above case be set on July 28, 2010 at 8:30 A.M.<br><br>Notify Attys.

No trial was necessary to resolve them. All the trial courts ought to know could be determined from the documents on record, namely, the sales invoices, the purchase orders, the respective places of business of petitioner and private respondent, and the jurisprudence on these issues. We cannot envision any factual question, and the trial courts did not mention any, to be threshed out before they can rule on these affirmative defenses. The error in refusing to resolve them violates so basic and elemental precepts on what and how discretion is to be exercised. We have to set aside and reverse these Orders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals also found that "the trial courts committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing the complaint to stand and stay in Manila."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It held that since the signature of Nutri-Asia's employee in the Sales Invoices was only for the receipt of goods, Nutri-Asia did not agree to be bound by the venue stipulation in the Sales Invoices. Meanwhile, Hygienic did not deny that an arbitration clause was written on the Purchase Orders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Its representative even "acknowledged its conformity to the purchase orders."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Since Hygienic "availed of the advantages and benefits of the purchase orders when it acted on them[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> it is thus estopped from rebuffing the arbitration clause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals held that Nutri-Asia should have submitted its Counter-Claim to arbitration for resolution.

Thus, the arbitration clause cannot bind petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Petitioner reiterates that the Purchase Orders constitute respondent's offer to petitioner to enter into a contract with it. Meanwhile, the Sales Invoices constitute petitioner's counter-offer rejecting the stipulation clause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Since the parties did not agree on the arbitration agreement, the arbitration clause is "inoperative and incapable of being performed, if not totally null and void."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also insists that the venue was properly laid when it filed the Complaint before the trial court in Manila. It claims that when respondent accepted the Sales Invoices without protest, it adhered to the contract, which included the venue stipulation. Petitioner points out that the person who signed the Sales Invoices was a high-ranking officer of respondent, not a mere messenger. By signing the Sales Invoices, respondent's representative bound the company to the venue stipulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Petitioner asserts that its Motion for Reconsideration and Petition are not prohibited pleadings. It filed the Motion to question both its Complaint's dismissal and the case's supposed referral to arbitration. Thus, the Motion does not fall under Rule 4.6 of the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution. There is no basis for this Court to deny outright the Petition, which assails the Court of Appeals Resolution denying the Motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also argues it raised purely questions of law:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><blockquote>The main contention of the petitioner is that the alleged arbitration agreement between the parties of this case did not comply with the requisites provided in the Rules. This is certainly not a question of fact but rather, a question of law, as it necessitates the interpretation and application of <b><i>Section 4 of [Republic Act No.] 876</i></b> to the attendant facts of the case.<br><br>....<br><br>Contrary to the position of the respondent, the specific issue on whether or not the messenger-signatory had the authority to bind petitioner Nutri-Asia with respect to the Arbitration Clause is not at all a question of fact. [Neither the] identity nor the rank of the signatory was not disputed or put in question so as to require further reception of evidence and conduction of trial. The truth or falsehood of the incidents related to the act of signing of the mere messenger is not disputed by the respondent. The issue is only with respect to his very authority to bind petitioner Hygienic as to the alleged agreement on arbitration.
