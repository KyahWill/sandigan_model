CEB CV No. 03231.<br><br>In the assailed Decision and Resolution, the CA affirmed the Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated August 7, 2009 (Joint Decision) rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Catbalogan, Samar, Branch 29 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 7400 for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Sale, Reconveyance and Damages and Civil Case No. 7408 for Quieting of Title and Ownership.<br><br><center><b>The Essential Facts and Antecedent Proceedings</b></center><br><br>As culled from the recital of facts in the assailed Decision, the essential facts and antecedent proceedings of the instant case are as follows:<br><br>The instant case stems from the consolidation and joint trial conducted by the RTC over two cases filed by both parties: (1) Civil Case No. 7400 for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Sale, Reconveyance and Damages filed by petitioner Uy; and (2) Civil Case No. 7408 for Quieting of Title and Ownership filed by the respondents Heirs of Julita Uy-Renales, namely respondent Jessica R. Rosero (respondent Jessica), respondent Joselito Renales (respondent Joselito), and respondent Janet Renales (respondent Janet) (collectively, the respondents Heirs of Julita).<br><br>The controversy is centered on Lot No. 43 (subject lot), with its improvement, erected thereon, <i>i.e.</i>, a building (subject building), containing an area of 198 square meters, more or less, particularly described as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A parcel of land (Lot No. 43, of the Cadastral Survey of Catbalogan, Cadastral Case No.4, L.R.C. Cadastral Record No. 1378), situated in the Poblacion, Municipality of Catbalogan, Province of Samar. Bounded on the NE by Calle San Bartolome St.; on the SE by Lot No. 42; on the SW by Lots Nos. 665 and 45; and on the NW by Lot No. 44 x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The subject lot is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. (TCT) T-1467 (subject TCT)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> registered in the name of petitioner Uy's mother, Eufronia Labnao (Labnao).<br><br>The relationship of the parties is as follows: Labnao had two children, <i>i.e.</i>, petitioner Uy and Julita Uy-Renales (Julita). Julita produced three children, <i>i.e.</i>, the respondents Heirs of Julita. Hence, petitioner Uy is the uncle of the respondents Heirs of Julita. Julita died intestate on May 9, 1976.<br><br>In his Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Sale, Reconveyance and Damages, petitioner Uy maintains that upon the death of Labnao in 1995, as the surviving offspring of Labnao, he became the owner of one-half share of the subject lot and subject building owned by his deceased mother, with the other half pertaining to the respondents Heirs of Julita as co­owners.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>However, petitioner Uy discovered that the subject lot was allegedly fraudulently sold by Labnao in 1990 in favor of the respondents Heirs of Julita through a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated April 11, 1990 (Deed of Absolute Sale) purportedly executed by Labnao. Petitioner Uy asserted that the signature of Labnao in the Deed of Absolute Sale is a patent forgery as shown by the findings of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory, Region VII.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon discovery of the falsification, petitioner Uy confronted his nieces and nephew before the Barangay Chairman of Brgy. IV, Catbalogan, Samar for a possible settlement of the matter, but to no avail. Having been deprived of his hereditary rights and co-ownership over the subject lot and the subject building through the fraudulent sale, he prayed for the nullification of the Deed of Absolute Sale, the reconveyance of one-half portion of the subject lot, partition, and damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In his Complaint, petitioner Uy also noted that the subject lot and subject building have been subject of a prior action for Interpleader filed before the RTC by the lessee of the subject building, Josefa I. Uy (Josefa), who filed the said action in order to determine who between petitioner Uy and the respondents Heirs of Julita should collect the lease rentals. The RTC rendered a Decision dated November 5, 1998 adjudging the respondents Heirs of Julita as the exclusive and absolute owners of the subject lot and subject building. However, on February 7, 2001, in CA-G.R. CV No. 62971, the CA reversed the said Decision and, without ruling definitively on the ownership of the said properties, held that the respondents Heirs of Julita and petitioner Uy are entitled to an equal share of the proceeds of the rent due from Josefa. The CA also ruled that the issue of ownership over the subject lot and subject building should be threshed out in a separate action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On their part, the respondents Heirs of Julita assert in their Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> for Quieting of Title and Ownership that they have acquired ownership over the subject lot when they purchased the same from their grandmother Labnao on April 11, 1990, as evidenced by the Deed of Absolute Sale.<br><br>And prior to the said sale and during the lifetime of their mother Julita, the latter allegedly constructed the subject building on the subject lot. That upon the death of Julita in 1976, as surviving heirs of the latter, they became the rightful and exclusive owners of the subject building by operation of law. Hence, the respondents Heirs of Julita maintain that their claim of ownership over the subject lot and the subject building is now absolute and that petitioner Uy's demand for reconveyance constituted a cloud obscuring their title and thus should be quashed.<br><br>The respondents Heirs of Julita also assert that petitioner Uy's allegation that the Deed of Absolute Sale is fictitious is belied by the prior dismissal of a criminal case for Falsification filed by petitioner Uy against the respondents Heirs of Julita.<br><br>After the issues were joined and consolidated, trial ensued and the parties were made to present their respective evidence in chief.<br><br>For petitioner Uy, the following witnesses were presented: petitioner Uy himself; Romeo M. Varona (Varona), Document Examiner of PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office No. VII at Camp Sotero Cabahug, Cebu City; Sonia M. Alvarina of the Commission on Audit; Edina S. Abrio, Court Stenographer of the Municipal Trial Court of Catbalogan, Samar (MTC); and Emerita C. Macabare, another personnel of the MTC.<br><br>For respondents Heirs of Julita, the following witnesses were presented: respondent Jessica; Dionito J. Aban (Aban), one of the purported witnesses who signed the Deed of Absolute Sale; and Atty. Jose M. Mendiola (Atty. Mendiola), the notary public who supposedly notarized the Deed of Absolute Sale.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br><br>The RTC rendered its Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> favoring the respondents Heirs of Julita. Believing that there was indeed a contract of sale that was entered into between Labnao and the respondents Heirs of Julita, the RTC held that any and all cloud on the title of the respondents Heirs of Julita over the subject lot should be erased, declaring the latter as the owners of the subject lot. Further, the RTC ordered the respondents Heirs of Julita to give petitioner Uy the present value of one-half of the subject building as the latter's share as co-owner by way of inheritance from Labnao. Lastly, the RTC held that once the aforementioned value is fixed and petitioner Uy's share is given to him, the title to the subject building shall be bestowed upon the respondents Heirs of Julita in exclusive ownership.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Joint Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court hereby rules and declares the following:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(1) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">To erase the cloud on the title to Lot No. 43 of Jessica, Joselito and Janet all surnamed Renales and thus declare them owners thereof and for Pablo L.

Moving to the core issue of the case, the RTC did not concur with petitioner Uy that there was no contract of sale that occured. According to the RTC's assessment, the single and most essential evidence presented by petitioner Uy with respect to the allegation that the Deed of Absolute Sale was falsified was the document examination undertaken by the PNP Crime Laboratory, Region VII. The RTC held that the courts are not bound by expert testimonies and was not convinced by the testimony of the handwriting expert presented by petitioner Uy, <i>i.e.,</i> Varona. The RTC also stressed on the fact that the Deed of Absolute Sale was notarized, explaining that a notarial document must be sustained in full force and effect.<br><br>With respect to the subject building, the RTC held that "[Labnao] excluded the building in the conveyance. In effect[,] she wanted that her heirs share it. Since the Court finds that [the] same belonged to [Labnao], [one-half] of it should be given to [petitioner] Uy. As in fact, in the earlier case between the parties respecting the division of rents, the [CA] deemed it wise to effect an equal sharing of [the] same. So should this Court[,] because [petitioner] Uy established that he and [Labnao] buil[t] the existing building. It belonged to [Labnao] but not included in the sale."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Feeling aggrieved, petitioner Uy appealed before the CA.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the CA</b></center><br><br>In the assailed Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the assailed Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.

However, the respondents failed to file any Comment. Hence, the respondents' right to file a Comment on the instant Petition is deemed waived.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br><br>Stripped to its core, the essential issue to be resolved by the Court is whether there was a contract of sale that was entered into between the parties' predecessor-in-interest, Labnao, and the respondents Heirs of Julita, transferring ownership over the subject lot in the latter's favor.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>The instant Petition is <i>meritorious</i>.<br><br><b><i>The Deed of Absolute Sale <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>was not properly notarized</i></b><br><br>In determining whether Labnao indeed sold the subject lot to the respondents Heirs of Julita, the CA confined its discussion mainly to the evidence concerning the authenticity and due execution of the written document denominated as <i>Deed of Absolute Sale</i>, focusing on the dependability of the said document on account of its notarization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees with the CA's finding that the Deed of Absolute Sale was properly notarized.<br><br>According to the notarial law applicable during the time of the notarization of the Deed of Absolute Sale, "[e]very contract, deed, or other document acknowledged before a notary public shall have certified thereon that the parties thereto have presented their proper (cedula) residence certificates or are exempt from the (cedula) residence tax x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The presentation of competent evidence of identity is required where a document is acknowledged before a notary public "to ascertain the identity/identities of the person/s appearing before him and to avoid impostors."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, as confirmed by the RTC, the notary public, <i>i.e.,</i> Atty.

Mendiola unequivocally admitted that he "no longer verified the identity of the old woman[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Because the Deed of Absolute Sale was not properly notarized, it cannot be presumed, contrary to the CA's holding, to have been regularly executed.<br><br><b><i>The existence of an alleged <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>notarized deed of sale is not</i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i> decisive as to the existence</i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i> and validity of a contract of <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>sale</i></b><br><br>A contract is a <i>meeting of minds</i> between two persons whereby one binds himself/herself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Article 1458 of the Civil Code, in turn, defines a sale as a contract whereby one of the contracting parties, <i>i.e.,</i> the seller, obligates himself/herself to transfer the ownership and to deliver a determinate thing, and the other party, <i>i.e.,</i> the buyer, obligates himself/herself to pay therefor a price certain in money or its equivalent.<br><br>Thus, the elements of a contract of sale are: (1) consent; (2) object; and (3) price in money or its equivalent. The absence of any of these essential elements negates the existence of a perfected contract of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>A contract of sale is a <u>consensual contract</u>. Under Article 1475 of the Civil Code, the contract of sale is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of minds upon the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price. Because a contract of sale is a consensual contract, no particular form is required for its validity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Thus, even if there is a document that purports to be a contract of sale, if there is strong countervailing evidence establishing the want of consent or meeting of the minds, there is no contract of sale.<br><br>In <i>Spouses Salonga v.

Neither is the notarization of a document conclusive as to the nature of the transaction, nor is it conclusive of the true agreement of the parties thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Simply stated, the existence, veracity, and authenticity of a notarized written deed of sale do not conclusively determine whether all the essential requisites of a contract are present.<br><br>Applying the foregoing to the instant case, as made clear in the respondents Heirs of Julita's Formal Offer of Exhibits/Documentary Evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> there is no other documentary evidence that had been offered to prove that a contract of sale was entered into by the parties aside from the Deed of Absolute Sale. The only other evidence presented to prove the existence of a contract of sale is <b>the testimony of respondent Jessica</b>.<br><br>A careful review of the sworn testimony of respondent Jessica reveals that the respondents Heirs of Julita never consented to enter into any contract of sale, completely belying the contents of the Deed of Absolute Sale. Otherwise stated, respondent Jessica's testimony establishes that there was, in fact, no meeting of the minds with respect to the alleged sale of the subject lot.<br><br>Respondent Jessica never testified that the respondents Heirs of Julita approached Labnao to offer to buy the subject lot. Nor did she testify that the respondents Heirs of Julita consented to purchase the subject lot.

To the mind of the Court, therefore, there was no valid contract of sale in the instant case.<br><br>Aside from the foregoing, it also does not escape the Court's attention that the purported Deed of Absolute Sale was never registered with the Registry of Deeds. Nor was the Deed of Absolute Sale annotated on the subject TCT. In fact, the subject TCT was never transferred to the names of the supposed buyers, remaining to be registered in the name of Labnao. If there was truly a legitimate and genuine sale transaction that occurred, the supposed buyers, according to ordinary human experience, would have endeavored to secure the registration of the Deed of Absolute Sale and facilitate the transfer of the subject TCT in their name. Hence, the Court is convinced that there was no contract of sale.<br><br><b><i>Void Donation of an <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>Immovable Property</i></b><br><br>What the Court deduces from the facts on record is that Labnao's intention was to ensure that her grandchildren — the respondents Heirs of Julita — would exclusively receive the subject lot. Thus, instead of simply donating the property, Labnao opted to simply simulate a contract of sale.<br><br>Unfortunately, even as a transfer of the subject lot to the respondents Heirs of Julita, the Deed of Absolute Sale cannot be considered a valid donation.<br><br>According to Article 749 of the Civil Code, in order for a donation of an immovable property to be considered valid, <b>the donation must be made in a public document,</b> specifying therein the property donated and the value of the charges which the donee must satisfy. In the instant case, as already explained, the Deed of Absolute Sale was not properly notarized, making it a private document. Hence, there was no donation made in a public document.<br><br>Moreover, Article 749 of the Civil Code additionally requires that the donee manifests his/her acceptance of the donation of the immovable property in either the same public instrument or in a separate instrument. If the donee accepts the donation in a separate instrument, the donor should be notified thereof in an authentic form, and this step shall be noted in both instruments. In the instant case, there was no acceptance of any donation manifested by the respondents Heirs of Julita in the unilaterally executed Deed of Absolute Sale. There was also no separate instrument that was executed by the respondents Heirs of Julita for the purpose of accepting any donation fron their grandmother. Simply stated, the formalities of making and accepting a donation of an immovable property required under Article 749 of the Civil Code were not observed. The donation of real property is <b>void</b> without the formalities stated in Article 749.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Even if it were a valid donation, it would have been collated back to the estate of Labnao pursuant to Articles 908 and 1064 of the Civil Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and petitioner Uy and the respondents Heirs of Julita would have divided the estate of Labnao equally, with petitioner Uy inheriting in his own right and the respondents Heirs of Julita inheriting as a group <i>per stirpes</i> or by right of representation.<br><br><b><i>In Conclusion</i></b><br><br>Hence, considering that there is no valid contract of sale or donation of immovable property transferring the subject lot from Labnao to the respondents Heirs of Julita, and bearing in mind that the RTC's holding in the Joint Decision that the subject building is under the co-ownership of petitioner Uy and the respondents Heirs of Julita was left undisturbed, the Court holds that <b>both</b> the subject lot and building are under the co-ownership of petitioner Uy and the respondents Heirs of Julita as the intestate heirs of Labnao.
