				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A petitioner's demise extinguishes his or her legal capacity, which would warrant the dismissal of any of his or her pleadings pending in court. Moreover, when one acts as a private complainant to a criminal action, his or her role is confined to being a mere witness whose interest is limited only to the civil liability. The criminal aspect can only be undertaken by the State through the Office of the Solicitor General or any other person specifically authorized by law. Without any action on their part, the criminal action cannot prosper.<br><br>This case involves a man with cognitive disability<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> who, at 24 years old, was made by his legal guardians to undergo bilateral vasectomy without his consent. Aware of the special circumstances of this case, this Court is called upon to draw the line between a valid exercise of parental authority over a person with disability, and the commission of child abuse as contemplated and penalized by Republic Act No. 7610, or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act. This case also seeks to establish whether the cause of action and attribution of criminal liability survive the death of petitioner Sister Pilar Versoza (Sister Versoza), pending resolution of her Petition.<br><br>This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed by Sister Versoza, assailing the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Court of Appeals.

His cognitive and physical growth did not appear normal in that "at age 3 to 4 years, Larry could only crawl on his tummy like a frog . . .;" he did not utter his first word until he was three years of age; did not speak in sentences until his sixth year; and only learned to stand up and walk after he turned five years old. At age six, the Aguirre spouses first enrolled Larry at the Colegio de San Agustin, Dasmariñas Village, but the child experienced significant learning difficulties there. In 1989, at age eleven, Larry was taken to specialists for neurological and psychological evaluations. The psychological evaluation done on Larry revealed the latter to be suffering from a mild mental deficiency. Consequent thereto, the Aguirre spouses transferred Larry to St. John Ma. Vianney, an educational institution for special children.<br><br>In November of 2001, respondent Dr. Agatep, a urologist/surgeon, was approached concerning the intention to have Larry, then 24 years of age, vasectomized. Prior to performing the procedure on the intended patient, respondent Dr. Agatep required that Larry be evaluated by a psychiatrist in order to confirm and validate whether or not the former could validly give his consent to the medical procedure on account of his mental deficiency.<br><br>In view of the required psychiatric clearance, Larry was brought to respondent Dr. Pascual, a psychiatrist, for evaluation. In a psychiatric report dated 21 January 2002, respondent Dr. Pascual made the following recommendation:<br><blockquote>[T]he responsibility of decision making may be given to his parent or guardian.<br><br>....<br><br>Larry grew up with a very supportive adoptive family. He is the youngest in the family of four sisters. <i>Currently, his adoptive parents are already old and have medical problem and thus, they could no longer monitor and take care of him like before. His adoptive mother has Bipolar Mood Disorder and used to physically maltreat him</i>. A year ago, he had an episode of dizziness, vomiting and headaches after he was hit by his adoptive mother. Consult was done in Makati Medical Center and several tests were done, results of which were consistent with his developmental problem. There was no evidence of acute insults. <i>The family subsequently decided that he should stay with one of his sisters to avoid similar incident and the possibility that he would retaliate although he has never hurt anybody. There has been no episode of violent outburst or aggressive behavior. He would often keep to himself when sad, angry or frustrated.</i><br><br>He is currently employed in the company of his sister and given assignment to do some photocopying, usually in the mornings. He enjoys playing billiards and basketball with his nephews and, he spends most of his leisure time watching TV and listening to music. <i>He could perform activities of daily living without assistance except that he still needs supervision in taking a bath. He cannot prepare his own meal and never allowed to go out and run errands alone. He does not have friends and it is only his adoptive family whom he has significant relationships. He claims that he once had a girlfriend when he was in high school who was more like a best friend to him. He never had sexual relations</i>. He has learned to smoke and drink alcohol few years ago through his cousins and the drivers. There is no history of abuse of alcohol or any prohibited substances.<br><br>. . . . <br><br><i>Larry's mental deficiency could be associated with possible perinatal insults, which is consistent with the neuroimaging findings. Mental retardation associated with neurological problems usually has poorer prognosis. Larry is very much dependent on his family for his needs, adaptive functioning, direction and in making major life decisions. At his capacity, he may never understand the nature, the foreseeable risks and benefits, and consequences of the procedure (vasectomy) that, his family wants for his protection. Thus, the responsibility of decision making may be given to his parent or guardian</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote>While no explanation was provided in Dr. Marissa Pascual's (Dr. Pascual) psychiatric report, medical journals have discussed perinatal insults as having the effect of altering brain development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Using this assessment as basis, and upon the instruction and written consent of Pedro, Dr. Juvido Agatep (Dr. Agatep) performed a bilateral vasectomy on Larry on January 31, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Two (2) cases arose simultaneously after the vasectomy.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"> The first case, docketed as G.R.

Warrants of arrest were issued against the accused, who then posted their respective bail bonds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Pedro and Michelina respectively moved for the dismissal of the case and for the re-determination of probable cause. Dr. Pascual filed several motions seeking the quashal of the information and warrant of arrest and the disqualification of the private prosecutor. In addition, Pedro and Michelina filed a motion requesting a stipulation from the trial prosecutor if she intended to prosecute the case under Republic Act No. 7610 considering that the matter had been previously decided by the Department of Justice and was under the review of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On November 8, 2005, the Regional Trial Court issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dismissing the case as there was "no probable cause ... to hold the accused for trial for violation[s] of Sections 3 and 10 of [Republic Act No.] 7610[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In the Order, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court declared:<br><blockquote>As to the first issue of whether or not the case should be dismissed, the Court finds merit to grant the motion. After a careful re-evaluation and scrutiny of the records of the case, the Court is inclined to reverse its former Order dated August 26, 2005, finding the existence of probable cause to hold the accused for trial. It was only later after the Court made a determination of probable cause that the supporting documents were attached to the records of the case particularly the Resolution of the Prosecutor's Office dated August 26, 2003 dismissing the Complaint for violation of RA 7610. Further, the Court was not aware that there was already a Decision rendered by the Court of Appeals dismissing the Complaint for falsification and mutilation against the accused because the same evidence was only attached to the records during the filing of the motions of the parties. In the said Decision, bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry does not constitute mutilation, the same issue being raised in the instant case for violation of RA 7610 as bilateral vasectomy has never been a crime and cannot be considered a form of child abuse. It does not find print in the said law. At most, it is a widely accepted and recognized medical procedure.<br><br>After going through re-evaluation of the records and evidence of the case, the Court finds merit to re-determine the existence of probable cause.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In the case at bar, there was already a pronouncement made by the Court of Appeals, which was learned by this Court only after it made a prior determination of probable cause, that there was neither a case of falsification nor mutilation. This stands to reason that the Court was misled by the circumstances surrounding the case for the determination of probable cause. Had it known that there was already contradictory resolutions issued by the Public Prosecutors and the Decision rendered by the [C]ourt of Appeals touching the core issue of mutilation, this Court would have dismissed the case. However, this Court belatedly learned such facts. Consequently, there is a need to re-determine the existence of probable cause.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In the case at bar, the main core for the filing of the instant Information for violation of RA 7610 sprung from the bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry Aguirre. There was already a judicial determination made by the Court of Appeals that no probable cause exists with respect to bilateral vasectomy to be considered as mutilation. Consequently, there would also be no violation of RA 7610. But then, it appears in the instant case that the prosecutors have similarly misappropriated, if not abused, their discretion by filing an Information for violation of RA 7610. There is no reason to hold the accused for trial and further expose them to an open and public accusation of the crime when no probable cause exists.<br><br>A prosecuting officer is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of law, the two fold aim of which is that the guilt shall not escape or innocence suffers. . . . But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much as (<i>sic</i>) his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just once (<i>sic</i>) (<i>Suarez vs. Judge Platon</i> 69 Phil 556).<br><br>It is therefore imperative upon the fiscal or the judge as the case maybe, (<i>sic</i>) to relieve the accused from the pain of going thru a trial once it is ascertained that the evidence is <i>insufficient to sustain a prima facie case or that no probable cause exists</i> to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused.<br><br>In sum the Court finds that no probable cause exists to hold the accused for trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>As to Sister Versoza's standing to sue, the Regional Trial Court held:<br><blockquote>Under the law, once an adoption has been decreed, the legal ties between the biological parents and the children severed (<i>sic</i>). By analogy, since the subject child, Larry Aguirre was under an authorized adoption agency, the relationship between the said institution and the said child was severed and parental authority is now vested with the adopting parents. This is now safe to assume that Sister Pilar is divested of personality to file a complaint against the accused for violation of Sections 3 and 10 of RA 7610. If at all, it is only the State who has the right to prosecute for violation of the said law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>Sister Versoza moved for reconsideration, but her Motion was denied in the Regional Trial Court's January 31, 2006 Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The trial court again emphasized her lack of legal capacity to sue:<br><blockquote>As to the second issue of the legal capacity of herein movant to participate in the proceedings, the Court has likewise ruled in the questioned order to the effect that inasmuch as herein movant merely represents the institution which took care of the victim Larry Aguirre prior to his adoption and facilitated the same until he was eventually legally adopted, she has, technically, no more legal capacity to appear in his behalf[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>Thus, Sister Versoza appealed the Regional Trial Court Orders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In its May 16, 2009 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied her appeal and upheld the dismissal of the Information against Pedro, Michelina, and Dr. Pascual. It stated:<br><blockquote>[The] bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry Aguirre cannot be considered a form of child abuse. In fact, the bilateral vasectomy is not a surgical procedure that totally divests him of the essential organ of reproduction for the simple reason it does not entail the taking away of a part or portion of the male reproductive organ. Vasectomy as an elective surgical sterilization prevents conception from taking place but the male reproductive organs remain intact as the body continues to produce sperm, the intentional act of vasectomy procedure prevents pregnancy which is not the same thing as saying that the reproductive capacity is permanently impaired .... While the bilateral vasectomy does not totally preclude him from siring an offspring and/or raising a family, the operation is reversible and therefore, has not caused permanent damage on his person; neither does it demeans, (<i>sic</i>) debases (<i>sic</i>) and degrades (<i>sic</i>) the intrinsic worth and dignity of Larry Aguirre as a person. Thus, the surgical procedure cannot be considered prejudicial to the child's development.<br><br>Neither is the bilateral vasectomy considered an act of cruelty. <i>Black's Law Dictionary </i>defines "cruelty" as the intentional and malicious infliction of physical or mental suffering upon living creatures, particularly human beings, or, as applied to the latter, the wanton, malicious and unnecessary infliction of pain upon the body, or the feelings and emotions. The test is whether the accused deliberately and sadistically augmented the victim's suffering by causing another wrong not necessary for its commission or inhumanly increased the victim's suffering or outraged (<i>sic</i>) ....<br><br>It is settled that once an information has been filed in Court, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court. The Court remains the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it notwithstanding the power of the prosecutor to retain the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Affirming the trial court's finding that Sister Versoza had "no personality to prosecute the [criminal] complaint[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court of Appeals declared that her being part of Heart of Mary Villa did not authorize her to appear as a private complainant.

Although bilateral vasectomy does not constitute mutilation, it is still punishable as child abuse under Republic Act No. 7610.

In the prosecution of the offense, the complainant's role is limited to that of a witness for the prosecution such that when a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal therefrom on the criminal aspect may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General. The private offended party or complainant may not take such appeal, but may only do so as to the civil aspect of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>As a private complainant to the criminal action, petitioner's role is confined to being a mere witness, her interest in the case limited to only the civil liability. Only the State, through the Office of the Solicitor General, can appeal the criminal aspect of the case. Thus, absent any action on the part of the Office of the Solicitor General, the appeal cannot prosper.<br><br>Moreover, considering that petitioner died during the pendency of this case, she no longer has the legal capacity to pursue the appeal.<br><br>For these reasons, the Petition should be denied.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>The prosecution of criminal offenses begins with the filing of a complaint or an information. Ordinarily, a complaint is "subscribed by the offended party, any peace officer, or other public officer charged with the enforcement of the law violated."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> On the other hand, an information is subscribed by a prosecutor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> It is usually the offended party or a law enforcer who commences the case's prosecution. This is the traditional concept of the prosecution of criminal offenses.<br><br>However, the rule is different in cases involving private crimes and those punishable under special laws.

Rule 110, Section 5 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure enumerates crimes that require the intervention of specific individuals before criminal proceedings can be had:<br><blockquote>SECTION 5. <i>Who must prosecute criminal actions</i>. — ...<br></blockquote><blockquote><i>The crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended spouse</i>. The offended party cannot institute criminal prosecution without including the guilty parties, if both are alive, nor, in any case, if the offended party has consented to the offense or pardoned the offenders.<br></blockquote><blockquote><i>The offenses of seduction, abduction and acts of lasciviousness shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents or guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly pardoned by any of them. If the offended party dies or becomes incapacitated before she can file the complaint, and she has no known parents, grandparents or guardian, the State shall initiate the criminal action in her behalf.</i><br><br>The offended party, even if a minor, has the right to initiate the prosecution of the offenses of seduction, abduction and acts of lasciviousness independently of her parents, grandparents, or guardian, unless she is incompetent or incapable of doing so. Where the offended party, who is a minor, fails to file the complaint, her parents, grandparents, or guardian may file the same. The right to file the action granted to parents, grandparents, or guardian shall be exclusive of all other persons and shall be exercised successively in the order herein provided, except as stated in the preceding paragraph.<br><br><i>No criminal action for defamation which consists in the imputation of any of the offenses mentioned above shall be brought except at the instance of and upon complaint filed by the offended party.<br><br>The prosecution for violation of special laws shall be governed by the provisions thereof</i>.

This plain-meaning rule or <i>verba legis</i> derived from the maxim <i>index animi sermo est</i> (speech is the index of intention) rests on the valid presumption that the words employed by the legislature in a statute correctly express its intent or will and preclude the court from construing it differently. The legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by the use of such words as are found in the statute. <i>Verba legis non est recedendum</i>, or from the words of a statute there should be no departure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Here, petitioner hinged her legal standing on being a representative of a licensed child-caring institution under Section 27(d) of Republic Act No. 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> She brought this case as an officer or representative of the Heart of Mary Villa, the foster home that had custody of Larry before his guardianship was passed to the Aguirre Spouses.<br><br>Respondents Michelina and Pedro oppose this and claim that the Aguirre Spouses' appointment as Larry's legal guardians divested petitioner of the authority to file a criminal case for child abuse.

In particular, Article 220 enumerates the rights and duties that parents and those exercising parental authority have to their children or wards:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 220. The parents and those exercising parental authority shall have with respect to their unemancipated children or wards the following rights and duties:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="center">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%" valign="top"> <div align="justify">To keep them in their company, to support, educate and instruct them by right precept and good example, and to provide for their upbringing in keeping with their means; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(2)</div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><i>To give them love and affection, advice and counsel, companionship and understanding;</i></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(3) </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">To provide them with moral and spiritual guidance, inculcate in them honesty, integrity, self-discipline, self-reliance, industry and thrift, stimulate their interest in civic affairs, and inspire in them compliance with the duties of citizenship;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(4) </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><i>To enhance, protect, preserve and maintain their physical and mental health at all times</i>;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(5) </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><i>To furnish them with good and wholesome educational materials, supervise their activities, recreation and association with others, protect them from bad company, and prevent them from acquiring habits detrimental to their health, studies and morals;</i></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(6)</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify"><i>To represent them, in all matters affecting their interests;</i></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(7) </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">To demand from them respect and obedience;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(8) </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">To impose discipline on them as may be required under a the circumstances; and</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">(9)</div></td> <td valign="top"> <div align="justify">To perform such other duties as are imposed by law upon parents and guardians.

The nature of parental authority was explained in <i>Santos, Sr. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><blockquote>The right of custody accorded to parents springs from the exercise of parental authority. <i>Parental authority</i> or <i>patria potestas</i> in Roman Law is the juridical institution whereby parents rightfully assume control and protection of their unemancipated children to the extent required by the latter's needs. <i>It is a mass of rights and obligations which the law grants to parents for the purpose of the children s physical preservation and development, as well as the cultivation of their intellect and the education of their heart and senses. As regards parental authority, "there is no power, but a task; no complex of rights, but a sum of duties; no sovereignty but a sacred trust for the welfare of the minor</i>. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>The authority granted to the Aguirre Spouses to raise Larry as their ward is a responsibility that went beyond the mere transfer of the child's physical custody. When they were granted guardianship, the Aguirre Spouses committed themselves to protect and uphold Larry's best interests. The State entrusted Larry's growth and development to the Aguirre Spouses, so that when the time comes, he may be an empowered citizen of the country, capable of making his own choices and fully undertaking his own responsibilities.<br><br>Granted, family affairs cannot always be subject to the State's inquiry, especially if no one comes forward to shed light on ongoing abuses, or worse still, if the abused merely sees the acts as matters of fact. Indeed, in child abuse cases, the parents or guardians may be the abusers themselves. Those entrusted with the care and protection of the child could very well be complicit in the abuse, if not its perpetrators. In these situations, allowing another person to represent the abused becomes apparent and more urgent, which is why barangay chairs, social workers, and concerned responsible citizens are enjoined to file a complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> When the abuse happens, no one else will protect them from such harm.<br><br>Thus, the argument that the transfer of parental authority has severed all ties between Larry and Heart of Mary Villa does not hold water. To tolerate this line of reasoning would be to allow the persistence of abuses against children. Under no circumstances must child abuse be allowed to hide behind a shroud of secrecy, even more so if it is committed under the guise of parental authority. The title of a parent or guardian is not a magic word to be wielded with immunity. With it comes the ultimate responsibility of raising the child or ward under the best conditions, allowing him or her to mature into an empowered individual.<br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br>The protection afforded under Republic Act No. 7610 recognizes persons with mental or intellectual impairments that prevent them from fully engaging in the community. Our laws accord a high level of protection to those with cognitive disability.<br><br>Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3.

Quintos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> a case involving the rape of a person with intellectual disability. This Court defined "twelve (12) years of age" under Article 266-A(1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code as either the chronological age of a child or the mental age if a person has intellectual disability:<br><blockquote>We are aware that the terms, "mental retardation" or "intellectual disability," had been classified under "deprived of reason." The terms, "deprived of reason" and "demented," however, should be differentiated from the term, "mentally retarded" or "intellectually disabled." An intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived of reason or demented. This court had even ruled that they may be credible witnesses. However, his or her maturity is not there despite the physical age. He or she is deficient in general mental abilities and has an impaired conceptual, social, and practical functioning relative to his or her age, gender, and peers. Because of such impairment, he or she does not meet the "socio-cultural standards of personal independence and social responsibility."<br></blockquote><blockquote>Thus, a person with a chronological age of 7 years and a normal mental age is as capable of making decisions and giving consent as a person with a chronological age of 35 and a mental age of 7. Both are considered incapable of giving rational consent because both are not yet considered to have reached the level of maturity that gives them the capability to make rational decisions, especially on matters involving sexuality. Decision-making is a function of the mind. <i>Hence, a person's capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her chronological age but by his or her mental age. Therefore, in determining whether a person is "twelve (12) years of age" under Article 266-A (1) (d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is established</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In light of this interpretation, and based on the distinction set forth in Section 3(a), a person who has a cognitive disability would be considered a child under Republic Act No. 7610 based on his or her mental age, not chronological age.<br><br>In this case, it is without question that, despite his chronological age, Larry is a child under the law.

No. 7610. I find that the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in affirming the Order of the trial court dismissing the child abuse case for lack of probable cause. Based on the evidence on record, the vasectomy performed on Larry does not constitute child abuse or cruelty to a child as contemplated under Section 10(a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of R.A. No. 7610.<br><br>With the untimely demise of Versoza, I agree with the <i>ponencia </i>that such supervening event warrants the dismissal of the case. At any rate, for the guidance of the Bench and the Bar, the novel issue of whether the bilateral vasectomy conducted on Larry constitutes child abuse under R.A. No. 7610 should be resolved. I also have to agree that the issue of whether the bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry constitutes child abuse under R.A. No. 7610 is one of transcendental importance to others similarly situated due to mental deficiency, inasmuch as the term "child" not only refers to "a person below eighteen (18) years of age, but also to one over said age who, upon evaluation of a qualified physician, psychologist or psychiatrist, is found to be incapable of taking care of himself fully because of a physical or mental disability or condition or of protecting himself [/or herself] from abuse."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Besides, even if petitioner Versoza had already passed away during the pendency of the instant petition, Section 2, Article XI of R.A. No. 7610 mandates that the State shall intervene on behalf of the child when acts of abuse, exploitation and discrimination against the child are committed by the parent, guardian, [as in the case of respondent Pedro Aguirre] teacher or person having care and custody of the same. Section 2, Article XI explicitly states that the best interests of children shall be the paramount consideration in all actions concerning them, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities and legislative bodies. It is in line with this provision that the Court may, in the interest of justice, resolve the issue of whether the bilateral vasectomy conducted on Larry constitutes child abuse under R.A. 7610. After all, it is not Larry who died, but Versoza, his former guardian who was then a social worker or representative of a licensed child-caring institution when she filed the complaint on behalf of Larry. It is safe to say that Larry is still alive today, there being no showing to the contrary, bearing the lingering effect of his bilateral vasectomy.<br><br>On the merits of the case, I join Justice Francis H. Jardeleza and Justice Caguioa in disagreeing with the <i>ponencia</i> that the bilateral vasectomy conducted on Larry is an act of child abuse.<br><br>In <i>P/C Supt. Pfleider v. People,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> it was held that "the determination of probable cause is not lodged with this Court. Its duty, in an appropriate case, is confined to the issue of whether the executive or judicial determination, as the case may be, of probable cause was done without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to want of jurisdiction." This is consistent with the general rule that criminal prosecutions may not be restrained or stayed by injunction, preliminary or final. There are, however, exceptions to this rule, some of which are enumerated in <i>Brocka v. Enrile.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> None of such exceptions obtain in this case.<br><br>Moreover, this Court is not a trier of facts, and the determination of probable cause is and will always entail a review of the facts of the case.<br><br>In finding that no probable cause exists to hold the accused for trial, the RTC ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>In the case at bar, there was already a pronouncement made by the Court of Appeals, which was learned by this Court only after it made a prior determination of probable cause, that there was neither a case of falsification or mutilation. This stands to reason that the Court was misled by the circumstances surrounding the case or the determination of probable cause. Had it known that there was already contradictory resolutions issued by the Public Prosecutors and the Decision rendered by the Court of Appeals touching the core issue of mutilation, this Court would have dismissed the case. However, this Court belatedly learned of such facts. Consequently, there is a need to re-determine the existence of probable cause.<br><br>xxx the main core for the filing of the instant information for violation of RA 7610 sprung from the bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry Aguirre. There was already a judicial determination made by the Court of Appeals that no probable cause exists with respect to the bilateral vasectomy to be considered as mutilation. Consequently, there would be no violation of RA 7610. But then it appears that in the instant case that the prosecutors have similarly misappropriated, if not abused, their discretion in filing an Information for violation of RA 7610. There is no reason to hold the accused for trial and further expose them to an open and public accusation of the crime when no probable cause exists.</blockquote>In upholding the dismissal of the complaint for child abuse, the CA aptly held, thus:<br><blockquote>Bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry Aguirre cannot be considered a form of child abuse. In fact, the bilateral vasectomy is not a surgical procedure which totally divests him of the essential organ of reproduction for the simple reason that it does not entail the taking away of a part of portion of the male reproductive organ. Vasectomy as an effective surgical sterilization prevents conception from taking place but the male reproductive organs remain intact as the body continues to produce sperm, the intentional act of vasectomy procedure prevents pregnancy which is not the same thing as saying that the reproductive incapacity is permanently impaired. While the bilateral vasectomy does not totally preclude him from siring an offspring and/or raising a family, the operation is reversible and therefore has not caused permanent damage on his person, neither does it demean, debase and degrade the intrinsic worth and dignity of Larry Aguirre as a person. Thus, the surgical procedure cannot be considered prejudicial to the child's development.</blockquote>On the issue of whether the bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry constitutes child abuse as contemplated in R.A. No. 7610, I quote with approval the opinion of Justice Caguioa, thus:<br><blockquote>To sustain a conviction under Section 10(a) of RA 7610, proof of the accused's intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the child as a human being should be established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In this regard, the records show that while general allegations anent the purported degrading and demeaning effects of the vasectomy performed on Larry had been repeatedly made by Versoza during the course of the proceedings, not a single shred of evidence was offered to show that the respondents were impelled by any ill-motive in facilitating the questioned procedure. To my mind, no specific intent to debase, degrade or demean Larry's intrinsic worth as a human being had been convincingly shown, thereby negating respondents' criminal liability under Section 10(a) of RA 7610.<br><br>Quite the contrary, assessed in light of their intent as Larry's parents, the act of respondents cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be characterized as debasing, degrading or demeaning. Indeed, my own appreciation of that intent is that it was borne out of care and love for Larry, and by extension, for any offspring Larry may bear x x x.</blockquote>Probable cause is defined as the existence of facts and circumstances that engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed, and that the respondent is probably guilty of that crime and should be held for trial. The term does not mean "actual and positive cause" nor does it import absolute certainty. It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. A finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction. It is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged.<br><br>Based on the records, the specific intent to debase, degrade or demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being that was so essential in the crime of child abuse,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was absent on the part of accused-respondents when they had Larry undertake bilateral vasectomy. Hence, the Court of Appeals committed no reversible error in affirming the Order of the RTC, which dismissed the child abuse case against respondents for lack of probable cause.

We held:<br><blockquote>We are aware that the terms, "mental retardation" or "intellectual disability," had been classified under "deprived of reason." The terms, "deprived of reason" and "demented", however, should be differentiated from the term, "mentally retarded" or "intellectually disabled." An intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived of reason or demented. This court had even ruled that they may be credible witnesses. However, his or her maturity is not there despite the physical age. He or she is deficient in general mental abilities and has an impaired conceptual, social, and practical functioning relative to his or her age, gender, and peers. Because of such impairment, he or she does not meet the "socio-cultural standards of personal independence and social responsibility."<br><br>Thus, a person with a chronological age of 7 years and a normal mental age is as capable of making decisions and giving consent as a person with a chronological age of 35 and a mental age of 7. Both are considered incapable of giving rational consent because both are not yet considered to have reached the level of maturity that gives them the capability to make rational decisions, especially on matters involving sexuality. Decision-making is a function of the mind. <i>Hence, a person's capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her chronological age but by his or her mental age. Therefore, in determining whether a person is "twelve (12) years of age" under Article 266-A(1)(d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is established</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>Though Larry was chronologically 24 years old when the procedure was conducted on him, he actually had a mental age of an 8-year-old.

The Rules and Regulations of the questioned statute distinctly and separately defined child abuse, cruelty and exploitation just to show that these three acts are different from one another and from the act prejudicial to the child's development. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, an accused can be prosecuted and be convicted under Section 10 (a), Article VI of Republic Act No. 7610 if he commits any of the four acts therein.

The right to liberty guaranteed by the Constitution includes the right to exist and the right to be free from arbitrary personal restraint or servitude. The term cannot be dwarfed into mere freedom from physical restraint of the person of the citizen, but is deemed to embrace the right of man to enjoy the faculties with which he has been endowed by his Creator, subject only to such restraints as are necessary for the common welfare</i>. As enunciated in a long array of authorities including epoch-making decisions of the United States Supreme Court, liberty includes the right of the citizen to be free to use his faculties in lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any avocation, and for that purpose, to enter into all contracts which may be proper, necessary, and essential to his carrying out these purposes to a successful conclusion. The chief elements of the guaranty are the right to contract, the right to choose one's employment, the right to labor, and the right of locomotion.<br><br>In general, it may be said that liberty means the opportunity to do those things which are ordinarily done by free men.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Granted, this liberty is not impenetrable from interference.

The area of freedom where decisions surrounding one's right to procreate are made is sacrosanct, the protection further bolstered by one's right to privacy.<br><br>Although the right to privacy is intertwined with the right to liberty, it is a distinct right that is equally entitled to protection under the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Article III, Section 3(1) states that "[t]he privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise as prescribed by law."<br><br>The right to privacy, however, not only pertains to privacy of one's communication and correspondence. It has many dimensions, referred to as "zones of privacy," which are embedded in other constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. In <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><blockquote>[I]n view of the fact that there is an express recognition of privacy, specifically that of communication and correspondence which "shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of Court or when public safety and order" may otherwise require, and implicitly in the search and seizure clause, and the liberty of abode, the alleged repugnancy of such statutory requirement of further periodical submission of a sworn statement of assets and liabilities deserves to be further looked into.<br><br>In that respect the question is one of first impression, no previous decision having been rendered by this Court. It is not so in the United States where, in the leading case of <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>, Justice Douglas, speaking for five members of the Court, stated: "Various guarantees create zones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen. The Third Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers 'in any house' in time of peace without the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy. The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the 'right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.' The Fifth Amendment in its Self- Incrimination clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: 'The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'" After referring to various American Supreme Court decisions, Justice Douglas continued: "These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition is a legitimate one."<br><br>The <i>Griswold</i> case invalidated a Connecticut statute which made the use of contraceptives a criminal offense on the ground of its amounting to an unconstitutional invasion of the right of privacy of married persons; rightfully it stressed "a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees." It has wider implication though. The constitutional right to privacy has come into its own.<br><br>So it is likewise in our jurisdiction. The right to privacy as such is accorded recognition independently of its identification with liberty; in itself, it is fully deserving of constitutional protection. The language of Prof. Emerson is particularly apt: "The concept of limited government has always included the idea that governmental powers stop short of certain intrusions into the personal life of the citizen. This is indeed one of the basic distinctions between absolute and limited government. Ultimate and pervasive control of the individual, in all aspects of his life, is the hallmark of the absolute state. In contrast, a system of limited government safeguards a private sector, which belongs to the individual, firmly distinguishing it from the public sector, which the state can control. Protection of this private sector — protection, in other words, of the dignity and integrity of the individual — has become increasingly important as modern society has developed. All the forces of a technological age — industrialization, urbanization, and organization — operate to narrow the area of privacy and facilitate intrusion into it. In modern terms, the capacity to maintain and support this enclave of private life marks the difference between a democratic and a totalitarian society."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Apart from the Constitution, our laws also recognize the zones of privacy. In<i> Ople v.

It also holds a public officer or employee or any private individual liable for damages for any violation of the rights and liberties of another person, and recognizes the privacy of letters and other private communications. The Revised Penal Code makes a crime the violation of secrets by an officer, the revelation of trade and industrial secrets, and trespass to dwelling. Invasion of privacy is an offense in special laws like the Anti-Wiretapping Law, the Secrecy of Bank Deposits Act and the Intellectual Property Code.

As a child in need of greater care and consideration, respondents should have acted more humanely and responsibly.<br><br>Moreover, Larry's ability to exercise his right to procreate goes beyond a mere invocation of his reproductive health rights. It seeps into his capacity to form relationships, to start a family, to be a responsible parent, and to live his life as fully and as meaningfully as possible. Taking away his ability to sire children effectively debilitates him as a child and a human being. While Larry is not barred from engaging in a relationship or sexual relations that could lead to having a child, the vasectomy has severely limited his options to start a family of his own. The decision to undergo vasectomy, whether reversible or not, involves an act that is part of private rights. The right to reproduce forms part of how humans define themselves. The choice of whether to reproduce should be respected, even if the person has cognitive disability.<br><br>Thus, the vasectomy on someone with cognitive disability, without his' or her consent, is both an act of cruelty and an act prejudicial to the person's' development.<br><br>Cruelty refers to something that debases, degrades, or demeans the intrinsic value of a child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> This may be seen in two (2) ways. On one hand, it can refer to an act and the manner by which it was done. On the other hand, it can also refer to the result of an act.<br><br><i>The unconsented vasectomy on Larry is clearly a case of cruelty, not so much for the manner it was done, but because of the circumstances surrounding its commission and the resulting limitations to the way Larry will be able to live the rest of his life.</i><br><br>The vasectomy was a decision made by respondents despite the medical finding that Larry, at that time, was unable to comprehend the procedure's long-term ramifications. While parents are capable of exercising authority over their children, this authority is by no means unlimited. Parental authority is both a right and an obligation, granted by law under the presumption that it will be exercised for the full development of a child's mind, heart, and senses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Under no circumstances is it allowed to be exercised in a way that is violative of human dignity or will diminish another's intrinsic worth. <i>Santos, Sr. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> describes the nature of parental authority as a "sum of duties":<br><blockquote>[Parental authority] is a mass of rights and obligations which the law grants to parents for the purpose of the children's physical preservation and development, as well as the cultivation of their intellect and the education of their heart and senses. As regards parental authority, "there is no power, but a task; no complex of rights, but a sum of duties; no sovereignty but a sacred trust for the welfare of the minor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></blockquote>The mark of a good parent is not measured by his or her material wealth or mental faculties. Rather, a good parent is one who exhibits the patience, love, and ability to sacrifice so that the child discovers what it is to be nurtured, protected, and resilient.<br><br>Being cognitively disabled is not a barrier to parenthood. A person's disability has no direct correlation to being a good parent:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><blockquote>It is important to separate personality from disability, to acknowledge that cognitive limitation is only about how people learn. Rarely is it the most If significant factor in deciding whether someone can parent adequately.<br><br>A parent's disability, in itself, does not necessarily determine whether a parent will be a "good enough" parent. While the individual characteristics of the parent are important, the characteristics of the supports available have a lot of influence over whether parents will succeed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></blockquote>Under the philosophy of supported parenting, persons who are cognitively disabled are fully capable of being parents themselves if given wholehearted support by both their family and community.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> This requires that their needs be identified, including "the parent's individual learning style; the parent's current knowledge, behavior, attitudes, beliefs, values; available support systems, and available resources."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Yet, Larry's legal guardians, instead of acting <i>only</i> for his best interests, substituted his consent with their own under the guise of "protection."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> There were other options for Larry who, in time, could have children of his own. But this was taken away from him by the people who should have acted in Larry's best interest. To deprive him of all the options his life had to offer is an act of cruelty. It was an act borne out of selfishness, not love. It was not for them to conclude that Larry cannot become a parent or care for someone other than himself.<br><br>The State's responsibility to protect children with disabilities is both an international and constitutional commitment. When no one else is willing to take up the cudgels for Larry, the State must not renege on its duty to ensure the protection of his human dignity simply on the ground of procedural infirmity. The State must not allow the violation of a child's right made even in the misguided concept of parental authority.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote that the bilateral vasectomy conducted on Larry be considered as child abuse and a violation of Republic Act No. 7610.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, 1975.

In June 1980, he was, formally taken in as a ward by respondents Pedro Aguirre and the latter's spouse Lourdes S. Aguirre (Aguirres) by virtue of an Affidavit of Consent to Legal Guardianship executed by Sister Mary Concepta Bellosillo, Superior of the Heart of Mary Villa. Several years later, or on June 19, 1980, the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Balanga, Bataan, granted the Aguirres joint guardianship of Larry's person and property. In 1989, when Larry was eleven years old, and given his "somewhat slow mental development,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> he was taken to specialists for neurological and psychological evaluations which revealed that he had mild mental deficiency. In 2001, when Larry was 21 years old, the Aguirres approached respondent Dr. Juvido Agatep (Dr. Agatep), a urologist/surgeon, concerning their intention to have Larry vasectomized. Dr. Agatep, however, required that Larry first be evaluated by a psychiatrist to determine whether Larry is able, given his mental deficiency, to give consent to the requested medical procedure. In a psychiatric report dated January 21, 2002, respondent psychiatrist Dr. Marissa Pascual (Dr. Pascual) confirmed Larry's mental deficiency, finding that he is "very much dependent on his family for his needs, adaptive functioning, direction and in making major life decisions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> According to Dr. Pascual, Larry, "[a]t his capacity, x x x may never understand the nature, the foreseeable risks and benefits, and consequences of the procedure (vasectomy) that his family wants for his protection. Thus, the responsibility of decision making may be given to his parent or guardian."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On January 31, 2002, and with respondent Pedro's written consent, respondent Dr. Agatep performed bilateral vasectomy on Larry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In two complaint-affidavits dated September 9, 2002, Gloria Pilar S. Aguirre and Sister Pilar Versoza (Versoza) charged respondents Pedro, his daughter Michelina Aguirre-Olondriz, Dr. Agatep, and Dr. Pascual of falsification and mutilation under Articles 172 and 262, respectively, of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and/or Child Abuse under Sections 3 and 10 of RA 7610. The complaints for falsification and mutilation were dismissed by the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>It appears, however, that the OCP reconsidered its earlier resolution and ordered the filing of criminal Informations against respondents with the RTC <i>for violation of RA 7610</i>. Upon respondents' motions, the RTC, in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated November 8, 2005, nevertheless dismissed the case for lack of probable cause. Petitioner thus elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals (CA). In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated May 16, 2008, the CA held that the bilateral vasectomy performed on Larry is neither child abuse nor cruelty punishable under RA 7610. It also held that then appellant (now petitioner) Versoza is neither Larry's parent, adopter, or legal guardian, and therefore had no legal personality to institute the complaint against respondents. Aggrieved, petitioner filed this action before the Court.<br><br>In the meantime, respondents Michelina S. Aguirre-Olondriz and Pedro B. Aguirre, in a motion to dismiss, informed this Court that petitioner died on September 9, 2012, three days after suffering from a brain aneurysm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This was not denied by petitioner's counsel, who also maintained that, given the "transcendent importance" of the issue at hand, the case survives petitioner Versoza's death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center>II</center><br>In my view, RA 7610 does not criminalize vasectomy.

Whether the decision <i>is </i>in the best interest of said child in a particular case would, of course, be a triable question of fact to be resolved after the reception of evidence on the condition of the child and the situation of the parent/legal guardian.<br><br>Here, Justice Leonen cannot cite from the record sufficient scientific and medical evidence to show that Larry understands the nature and consequences of his sexuality, of his having a child, and of his being a parent. Dr. Pascual's conclusion that Larry may never understand the nature and consequences of vasectomy does not substitute for evidence that he understands the nature and consequences of bearing a child and being a parent. Neither is there evidence introduced below to show that Larry is' possessed of the <i>will and ability</i> to respond to the "needs and aspirations" of children he may beget, taking into account his (Larry's) "psychological preparedness, health status" and attendant "sociocultural and economic concerns," according to the provisions of RA 10354 on responsible parenthood.<br><br>On the contrary, Dr. Pascual, after examining Larry, noted that he "still needs supervision in taking a bath," "cannot prepare his own meal" or run errands alone, and whose human figure "is comparable to a 7-8 year old."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Larry also does not appear to have a source of income independent from his family. These, it must be emphasized, were never controverted by petitioner.<br><br>Similarly, there is no medical or scientific evidence on record to support either Justice Leonen's claim that Larry's mental age will grow to be 18 years of age or beyond at some point in the future or its theory of "supported parenting." Given the advancing age and medical problems of Larry's guardians, and their financial standing, it is imperative that there must be some showing that they are (or will still be) possessed with the resources to meet the requirements of "supported parenting" for any of Larry's future children.<br><br>Notably, Justice Leonen himself, in his Opinion holding curfew ordinances on minors unconstitutional, has characterized a parent's rights with respect to his/her family as no less "fundamental," "an integral aspect of liberty and privacy," which ought to "receive the support of Government," their interests being "superior" to the State whose decision can only substitute or supplement "when parental authority is established to be absent or grossly deficient."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Here, Larry's guardians claim that they made the decision to sterilize him due to the following considerations: they "are already old and have medical problem and x x x could no longer monitor and take care of him like before,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and "because of Larry's emerging sexuality and inability to take care of himself much less a child."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Absent any clear showing that this exercise of parental authority is absent or grossly deficient, it should be considered that respondent Pedro, as Larry's legally-constituted guardian with the obligation to ensure his well-being, has an equally important right to decide matters affecting the latter. Justice Leonen conspicuously fails to cite any basis on the record which would show how respondent Pedro's exercise of parental authority in this particular instance was absent or grossly deficient, much less that it actually operated to Larry's detriment.<br><br>With respect, I also take exception to Justice Leonen's insinuation that respondent Pedro "deprive[d] him of all the options [that] his life had to offer,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> even expressly characterizing their decision as "an act of selfishness; not one borne out of love."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> First, and considering that there is simply no evidence on record to support these statements, I find Justice Leonen's conclusions to be unfounded and unfair. Furthermore, parents, probably more than anyone else, are the ones expected to love and care for their child, to do their best to ensure and look after their child's best interests. This is even acknowledged by the law which provides a father's diligence as the default standard of care required in the general performance of obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Absent evidence to the contrary, respondent Pedro is presumed to always act in Larry's best interests; he would never have been granted guardianship over Larry otherwise. Respondent Pedro has taken Larry, an orphan, into his house and, from all available indications, brought him up like one of his own. I thus hesitate to be so harsh as to question respondent Pedro's motivations and impute bad faith on his parenting on account of Justice Leonen's disagreement (with the decision to vasectomize) based on a still to be established legal "principle."<br><br><center>B</center><br>We should also consider the provisions of the Family Code which prohibits persons under the age of 18 from contracting marriage;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and' allows the annulment of marriages contracted by parties between the ages of 18 and 21 when parental consent is not secured<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> or when either party was of unsound mind at the time of marriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> These provisions evince a State interest to ensure that parties contracting a marriage know their enormous responsibilities as future parents. The Family Code is replete with provisions making up the bundle of duties and responsibilities imposed upon parents/guardians with respect to their children/wards,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> including the duty to support, educate and provide for the child's upbringing. Pursuant thereto, should the State issue a marriage license in favor of an intellectually-disabled individual? A case can arguably be made that the same State interest (which allows the State to prohibit minors from contracting marriage) applies in cases of intellectually-disabled individuals who may wish to marry and have children. To my mind, an assertion of an unqualified right of an intellectually-disabled person to have children, because it implicates State interests, would require the reception of evidence to prove that the individual is willing and able to meet the bundle of duties and responsibilities imposed by the State as a consequence of parenthood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center>C</center><br>There is also Republic Act No. 11036 (RA 11036), otherwise known as the "Mental Health Act," which was approved only in June of last year.

Rodriguez</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> involved a suit brought by Mexican-American parents on behalf of school children said to be members of poor families who reside in school districts having a low property tax base. Asserting an implied right to education, which they claim is necessary for their effective exercise of their rights to free speech and suffrage, petitioners challenged the Texas system of financing public education (which provides that State funding for basic education is to be supplemented by each district through an <i>ad valorem</i> tax on property within its jurisdiction) insofar as it allegedly favored children from more affluent neighborhoods, in violation of equal protection requirements. The Court found unpersuasive, the reasons for the asserted liberty claim and held as follows:<br><blockquote><blockquote>Education, of course, is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected, x x x&nbsp; It is appellees' contention, however, that education is distinguishable from other services and benefits provided by the State, because it bears a peculiarly close relationship to other rights and liberties accorded protection under the Constitution. <b>Specifically, they insist that education is itself a fundamental personal right, because it is essential to the effective exercise of First Amendment freedoms and to intelligent utilization of the right to vote</b>, xxx<br><br><div align="CENTER">x x x x</div><br>We need not dispute any of these propositions. The Court has long afforded zealous protection against unjustifiable governmental interference with the individual's rights to speak and to vote.

But they are not values to be implemented by judicial intrusion into otherwise legitimate state activities.</b><br><br>Even if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is a constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of either right, we have no indication that the present levels of educational expenditures in Texas provide an education that falls short. Whatever merit appellees' argument might have if a State's financing system occasioned an absolute denial of educational opportunities to any of its children, <b>that argument provides <u>no basis for finding an interference with fundamental rights where only relative differences in spending levels are involved and where — as is true in the present case — no charge fairly could be made that the system fails to provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full participation in the political process</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote></blockquote><br>The US Supreme Court has also refused to recognize an asserted implied fundamental right to die in <i>Washington v.

After examining relevant history, tradition and practice, the Court ruled in the negative and held:<br><blockquote>That many of the rights and liberties protected by the Due Process Clause sound in personal autonomy does not warrant the sweeping conclusion that any and all important, intimate, and personal decisions are so protected, <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist. v.

Firstly, Justice Leonen cites the Constitution's <i>express </i>guarantee to due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> An examination of the due process clause, however, will immediately show that it does not <i>textually </i>grant upon an intellectually-disabled person a liberty interest in procreation and parenthood.<br><br>Justice Leonen then relies on the fundamental right to privacy, citing <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> which, in turn, cited <i>Griswold v.

Baird</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> building on the foundations of <i>Griswold</i>, would provide even stronger precedent. In the context of the right of unmarried persons to access contraceptives, the US Supreme Court held: "[i]f the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> Despite <i>Griswold </i>and <i>Eisenstadt</i>, however, the US Supreme Court has yet to recognize a fundamental right to procreation or parenthood on the part of the intellectually-disabled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> In fact, the various American State Supreme Courts are split on the issue, <i>depending in part on whether the State legislatures have statutes governing sterilization</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup><br><br>The reason is understandable. Recognizing a fundamental right in a single person to bear or beget a child, and becoming a parent, is a far cry from recognizing <i>in an intellectually-disabled person</i> a fundamental right to make the same decision on procreation or parenthood. The underlying issues that have bedeviled the courts and the state legislatures in the US include whether an intellectually-disabled person can make that decision and whether the parent or guardian can substitute the disabled child or ward in making that decision. As a commentator has so aptly stated, the ruling in <i>Eisenstadt</i> begs the question: "[b]ut what happens when that individual lacks the capacity to comprehend the possession of a reproductive function and, right, and is not capable of making any decision regarding that right?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> It presents, as the Supreme Court of New Jersey puts it, a "disturbing paradox: how we can preserve the personal freedom of one incapable of exercising it by allowing others to make a profoundly personal decision on her behalf?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup><br><br>Justice Leonen also cites the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Convention), which guarantees persons with disabilities a right to non-discrimination, <i>i.e</i>., full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> There is, however, no law, rule, nor judicial holding which provides that the Convention can operate to "create" a "fundamental" right in the absence of the enactment by a State party of an implementing law precisely creating such substantive right. Secondly, the Convention itself is carefully worded that it does not <i>textually</i> grant persons with disabilities a right to be treated with absolute equality. Rather, its language is carefully parsed to state that equality is "on an equal basis with others." By so qualifying, it is my view that the Convention realizes that the State must not only consider the particular type of disability affected, but also provide for remedies that relate to the specific type of interest to be promoted and their effect of the exercise of the right on "others." In Our case, the State, through the Congress and in explicit recognition of its obligations under the Convention, enacted RA 11036, or the "Mental Health Act." As discussed, RA 11036 does not treat persons with mental health conditions (which includes the intellectually-disabled) on the same footing as persons without such conditions, in terms of the role that their informed consent bears on their access to treatment (such as vasectomy). The law sought to balance the peculiar interests of the disabled with the interests of the other members of society (which includes their parents) through a very robust and exacting procedure to ensure the exercise of informed consent.<br><br>All told, there is no clear showing as to <i>how </i>Justice Leonen has arrived at (much less, justified) his conclusion that the unenumerated liberty interest of an intellectually disabled person to procreation or parenthood warrants accordance of the "fundamental" status. The record is absolutely bereft of evidence to prove the proposition. Thus, and without prejudice to a future and proper case where the modalities/approaches/methods for its analysis and interpretation are clearly and sufficiently set forth and first presented to a trier of fact with supporting evidence, I simply cannot support his view at this time.<br><br><center>V</center><br>Finally, I must note the peculiar process by which the asserted "fundamental" right is sought to be established by Justice Leonen in this case. Jurisprudence would show that assertion of fundamental rights, whether on due process or equal protection grounds, are usually made at the heels of a positive act on the part of the State, an exercise of State powers resulting to unwarranted intrusions into the personal life of individuals. Such exercises of governmental powers are typically manifested in the form of laws,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> ordinances,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> and executive acts<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> or issuances<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> which are alleged to, either facially or in its operation, actively discriminate and deprive individuals of certain fundamental rights.<br><br>Here, while there is an assertion of an infringement of "fundamental" liberties, there is no claim of any law, ordinance, or executive issuance of the State which has caused the infringement alleged. In fact, the specific act" in issue, that is, the vasectomy conducted on Larry, was carried out bymedical practitioners, upon guardian Pedro's request/consent, all of whom are private individuals. Clearly, there is no State action as to call for the guarantee of the protection of "fundamental" liberties. As so clearly held by this Court in <i>People v.

To reiterate, it is not the province of the Judiciary to speculate what the Legislature should have done:<br><blockquote>Even on the assumption that there is in fact a legislative gap caused by such an omission, neither could the Court presume otherwise and supply the details thereof, because a legislative lacuna cannot be filled by judicial fiat. Indeed, courts may not, in the guise of the interpretation, enlarge the scope of a statute and include therein situations not provided nor intended by the lawmakers. An omission at the time of the enactment, whether careless or calculated, cannot be judicially supplied however after later wisdom may recommend the inclusion. Courts are not authorized to insert into the law what they think should be in it or to supply what they think the legislature would have supplied if its attention has been called to the omission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup></blockquote></https:></https:></http:><http: emedicine.medscape.com="" article="" 452831-overview=""><https: www.nspcc.org.uk="" what-="" is-child-abuse="" types-of-abuse="" neglect="" #types=""><https: www.researchgate.net="" publication="" 51180520_psychological_treatments_in_intellectual_disabil="" ity_the_chalienges_of_buiiding_a_good_evidence_base="">I am afraid that Justice Leonen's proposition, however well-intentioned, is fraught with still unseen implications, and I am reminded of the following observation of Easterbrook:</https:></https:></http:><http: emedicine.medscape.com="" article="" 452831-overview=""><https: www.nspcc.org.uk="" what-="" is-child-abuse="" types-of-abuse="" neglect="" #types=""><https: www.researchgate.net="" publication="" 51180520_psychological_treatments_in_intellectual_disabil="" ity_the_chalienges_of_buiiding_a_good_evidence_base=""><br><blockquote>I am nervous when a case is so easy, x x x If "everyone" endorses a particular aspect of liberty, it is easy for the Court to say in the aberrant case (the one where the legislature has not acted) that the judges are the true guardians of the "spirit" of the people and may produce what an "enlightened" legislature would have done, x x x<br><br>xxx [E]asy cases, popular and obviously right cases, may produce dangerous doctrines because they establish the <i>principle </i>that the Constitution allows the judges to do whatever the legislature ought to have done, xxx<br><br>The easy cases allow judges to establish doctrines that collapse the judicial and legislative processes, x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup></blockquote><br>With these, I would reserve judgment on the issue of whether an intellectually-disabled person has a "fundamental" right to procreate until after Congress passes, if it so decides, a law on the subject.

Florida</i>, 572 U.S. ______ (2014), concluding that both terms refer to the same identical phenomenon. Earlier, in <i>Atkins v. Virginia</i>, 536 U.S. 304 (2002), using the term "mental retardation," the Court held that the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment renders unconstitutional the execution of a mentally retarded person. In <i>Hall</i>, the Court voided a Florida law that defines "intellectual disability" to require an intelligence quotient (IQ) test score of 70 or less, such that if a prisoner is deemed to have an IQ below 70, all further exploration of intellectual disability is foreclosed. The Court noted that the change in terminology is approved and used in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, one of the basic texts used by psychiatrists and other experts, and that the manual is often referred to by its initials "DSM," followed by its edition number, <i>e.g.</i>, "DSM-5." The Court also noted that a federal statute (Public Law 111-256), otherwise known as Rosa's Law, replaced the term "mental retardation" with "intellectual disability." See <i>People v. Quintos</i>, G.R. No. 199402, November 12, 2014, 740 SCRA 179, 201-202 where J. Leonen referred to, and defined, the term "intellectually disabled," citing the earlier case of <i>People v.

Florida</i> (572 U.S.___ (2014), the US Supreme Court held:<br><blockquote>That this Court, state courts, and state legislatures consult and are informed by the work of medical experts in determining intellectual disability is unsurprising. Those professionals use their learning and skills to study and consider the consequences of the classification schemes they devise in the diagnosis of persons with mental or psychiatric disorders or disabilities. Society relies upon medical and professional expertise to define and explain how to diagnose the mental condition at issue. And the definition of intellectual disability by skilled professionals has implications far beyond the confines of the death penalty: for it is relevant to education, access to social programs, and medical treatment plans. In determining who qualifies as intellectually disabled, it is proper to consult the medical community's opinions.<br><br><div align="center">x x x x<br></div><br>In addition to the views of the States and the Court's precedent, this determination is informed by the views of medical experts. These views do not dictate the Court's decision, yet the Court does not disregard these informed assessments. See [<i>Kansas v. Crane</i>, 534 U. S. 407, 413 (2002)] ("[T]he science of psychiatry . . . informs but does not control ultimate legal determinations. . ."). It is the Court's duty to interpret the Constitution, but it need not do so in isolation. The legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis, but it is informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework. <i>Atkins</i> itself points to the diagnostic criteria employed by psychiatric professionals. And the professional community's teachings are of particular help in this case, where no alternative definition of intellectual disability is presented and where this Court and the States have placed substantial reliance on the expertise of the medical profession.</blockquote>Here, even as it voided Florida's fixed standard of IQ of 70, the US Supreme Court reiterated the need for evidence of both subaverage intellectual functioning and significant limitations in adaptive skills. Similarly, in <i>Atkins v. Virginia</i>, 536 U.S. 304, 318 (2002), it held that "clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest before age 18."<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <i>People v.

Prior to the Warren Court era of the 1960's, there was an overall attitude of marginal judicial intervention with respect to equal protection cases. This "old" variety of equal protection scrutiny- was deferential; insisting merely that the classification in the contested statute reasonably relate to the avowed legislative purpose. This meant that the rational classification requirement was satisfied fairly readily. In the 1960s, the US Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren, embraced a "new" approach to equal protection whereby it came to find more areas where strict rather than' deferential scrutiny was to be applied. Under this "new" approach, strict scrutiny was to be applied when two characteristics were found to be present: the presence of "suspect" classifications or an impact on1 "fundamental" rights and interests. "Suspect" classifications typically involved those based on race, but eventually also included other areas as well (such as alienage, illegitimacy, gender, and wealth). Rights and interests considered fundamental by the Warren Court included those on voting, criminal appeals and interstate travel. Years later, the US Supreme Court under Chief Justice Warren E. Burger would retain the two-tier formulation of the Warren Court but slowed down any significant expansions with respect to defining new fundamental interests. In fact, scholars have noted a mounting discontent with the two-tier formulation such that Justice Marshall, in <i>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez</i>, 411 U.S. 1 (1973) would propose a "sliding scale" approach which provides that rather than limiting itself to two neat categories (between strict scrutiny and mere rationality), the Court should consider a spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination allegedly violative of the Equal Protection Clause. Under this "newer" equal protection model, the Court would be less willing to supply justifying rationales by exercising its imagination. Instead, it would have to gauge the reasonableness of the challenged means on the basis of materials offered it, rather than "resorting to rationalizations created by perfunctory judicial hypothesizing." This "newer" approach of modest interventionism essentially provides the middle ground and bridges the yawning gap between the extreme deference of the "old" approach and the excessive interventionism of the "new" approach.

Kansas</i>, 236 U.S. 1 (1915), wherein the US Supreme Court invalidated a Kansas law prohibiting employees from requiring employees not to join a union. The Court in <i>Coppage</i> held:<br><blockquote>Included in the right of personal liberty and the right of private property — partaking of the nature of each—is the right to make contracts for the acquisition of property. Chief among such contracts is that of personal employment, by which labor and other services are exchanged for money or other forms of property. If this right be struck down or arbitrarily ' interfered with, there is a substantial impairment of liberty in the long established constitutional sense. The right is as essential to the laborer as to the capitalist, to the poor as to the rich, for the vast majority of persons have no other honest way to begin to acquire property save by working for money.<br><br>An interference with this liberty so serious as that now under consideration, and so disturbing of equality of right, must be deemed to be arbitrary unless it be supportable as a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state. But, notwithstanding the strong general presumption in favor of the validity of state laws, we do not think the statute in question, as construed and applied in this case, can be sustained as a legitimate exercise of that power.<br><br><div align="center">x x x x<br></div><br>xxx <b>[S]ince the relation of employer and employee is a voluntary relation, as clearly as is that between the members of a labor organization, the employer has the same inherent right to prescribe the terms upon which he will consent to the relationship, and to have them fairly understood and expressed in advance.</b><br><br>When a man is called upon to agree not to become or remain a member of the union while working for a particular employer, he is in effect only asked to deal openly and frankly with his employer, so as not to retain the employment upon terms to which the latter is not willing to agree. And the liberty of making contracts does not include a liberty to procure employment from an unwilling employer, or without a fair understanding. Nor may the employer be foreclosed by legislation from exercising the same freedom of choice that is the right of the employee.<br><br>To ask a man to agree, in advance, to refrain from affiliation with the union while retaining a certain position of employment is not to ask him to give up any part of his constitutional freedom. He is free to decline the employment on those terms, just as the employer may decline to offer employment on any other, for "it takes two to make a bargain." Having accepted employment on those terms, the man is still free to join the union when the period of employment expires, or, if employed at will, then at any time upon simply quitting the employment. And, if bound by his own agreement to refrain from joining during a stated period of employment, he is in no different situation from that which is necessarily incident to term contracts in general. For constitutional freedom of contract does not mean that a party is to be as free after making a contract as before; he is not free to break it without accountability. Freedom of contract, from the very nature of the thing, can be enjoyed only by being exercised, and each particular exercise of it involves making an engagement which, if fulfilled, prevents for the time any inconsistent course of conduct, (Emphasis supplied.) <i>Id</i>. at 14, 20-21.</blockquote>See also Samberg, The Fundamentals of Fundamental Rights, https://medium.com/@mattsamberg/the-fundamentals-of-fundamental-rights-1138ced2ad4, last accessed November 13, 2018.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> 262 U.S. 390(1923).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Id. at 399-402.

Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health.

The jurors, under a sworn bailiff, visited the scene of the crime, accompanied by the judge, the counsel for both parties, and the court stenographer. The Court affirmed the conviction as there was no showing that there was a history or tradition in the State of Massachusetts affording the accused such right.

This test was again seen appropriate to evaluate "abusive executive action," which in said case was a police car chase which resulted in the death of one of those being chased.

In the case of <i>In Re Grady</i>, 85 N.J. 235, 426 A.2d 467 (1981), it was held that "[a] right to sterilization has yet to receive constitutional protection from the United States Supreme Court."<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> Fourteen states have statutes authorizing sterilization of persons with mental impairments who are deemed incapable of consent. For the most part, these statutes provide procedural and substantive safeguards designed to protect the class from arbitrary enforcement. (Cepko, '<i>'Involuntary Sterilization of Mentally Disabled Women</i>" 8 Berkeley Women's L.J. 122 [1993]). In states where no specific statues authorize sterilization, courts faced with a petition for sterilization have had varied responses. A majority of the courts will not accept jurisdiction absent legislative authority, but a minority accepts jurisdiction even without said authority and lay downs guidelines to be followed to determine if sterilization is warranted. (Irvine, "<i>Balancing the Right of the Mentally Retarded to Obtain a Therapeutic Sterilization Against the Potential for Abuse</i>" 12 Law &amp; Psychology Review 95 [1988], p. 96.) Typical of the majority view is that the inherent equity power of the courts did not include the ability to order a sterilization without statutory authority. (<i>Hudson v. Hudson</i>, 373 So. 2d 310 [1979], as cited by Irvine, "<i>Balancing the Right of the Mentally Retarded to Obtain a Therapeutic Sterilization Against the Potential for Abuse</i>," 12 Law &amp; Psychology Review 95 [1988], p. 107.) The minority view, on the other hand, while conceding that a right to sterilization has yet to receive express constitutional protection from the US Supreme Court, and most states have found that they lack the power to grant a petition for sterilization absent legislative authorization, relies on the inherent parens patriae power of the courts and maintains that it still holds the final determination whether consent to sterilization should be given on behalf of an incompetent individual. <i>In Re Grady</i>, 85 N.J. 235, 426 A.2d 467 (1981).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> Irvine, "<i>Balancing the Right of the Mentally Retarded to Obtain a Therapeutic Sterilization Against the Potential for Abuse</i>," 12 Law &amp; Psychology Review 95 (1988).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> <i>In Re Grady</i>, 85 N.J. 235,426 A.2d 467 (1981).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> <i>J</i>.

To my mind, no specific intent to debase, degrade or demean Larry's intrinsic worth as a human being had been convincingly shown, thereby negating respondents' criminal liability under Section 10(a) of RA 7610.<br><br><b>Quite the contrary, assessed in light of their intent as Larry's parents, the act of respondents cannot, <u>by any stretch of the imagination</u>, be characterized as debasing, degrading or demeaning.&nbsp; </b>Indeed, my own appreciation of that intent is that it was borne out of care and love for Larry, and by extension, for any offspring Larry may bear, as indicated by the following circumstances:<br><br>Foremost, a professional evaluation of Larry's personal circumstances revealed that he "grew up with a very supportive adoptive family."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This is consistent with the declarations of Pedro and Michelina to the effect that the vasectomy procedure was done merely as a <b>preventive</b> measure against unwanted pregnancies in light of Larry's "emerging sexuality and inability to take care of himself[,] much less a child [of his own]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> More so, the Spouses' age at the time precluded their ability to fully monitor and take care of Larry as much as they used to.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Quite clearly, the intent behind the decision of Pedro and Michelina to have Larry undergo the operation is to be- understood within the context of ensuring Larry's best interest. ,<br><br>Next, Larry was treated as one of the Spouses' own children; no expenses were spared by the Spouses when it came to Larry's welfare and educational needs. At the early age of 6, he was enrolled at the Colegio de San Agustin in Dasmariñas Village.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> At age 11, Larry was subjected to a psychological evaluation after showing signs of delayed development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Based on the recommendation of a medical professional, Larry was then transferred to St. John Marie Vianney, where he could receive special education and training.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Larry was later enrolled in a vocational course at Don Bosco after completing his secondary education.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In all these years, Larry could not prepare his own meals, do his errands, or even bathe himself without supervision from his parents or his older siblings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Yet, despite this, Larry confessed to having been in a relationship at least once and that he had learned to drink and smoke.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Taking the circumstances in their totality, it is crystal clear to me that Pedro and Michelina were driven by no other motive than that of love and compassion for Larry. If Larry were to reproduce, by deliberate choice or otherwise, the task of raising a child would be too difficult a task to undertake, given Larry's proven inability to take care of his own affairs. Inevitably, the responsibility to take care of the child would redound to the Spouses, who, as previously mentioned, are already encountering difficulty taking care of Larry alone. Thus, by no stretch of the imagination can it be said that there is any evidence of malevolent intent to debase or degrade Larry's intrinsic worth as a human being. <b>To declare otherwise, would be, to my mind, cruel and degrading to the adoptive parents who, by all indications, only sought the best for Larry.</b><br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the Petition, solely on the ground of mootness.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>Also stated as "Versoza" in some parts of the <i>rollo</i>.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 12.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 13.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 25.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 26.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 27.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 48.

I write this separate opinion to express my views on the proposed balancing of individual reproductive rights as against parental authority. Particularly implicated here is the individual's right to procreate as against the right and duty of parents to decide on behalf of their children who lack the capacity to consent to medical procedures which impinge on the right to procreate. As Larry's guardians and <i>de facto</i> parents, the spouses Aguirre's primary and natural right to bring up and care for Larry vests in them the right to decide what is best for the child they took in and raised as their own; and such decision is clothed with the presumption of good faith and legality until proven otherwise. Under our current legal regime, the right of parents or guardians to provide consent for medical procedures on behalf of intellectually disabled persons who are unable to provide such consent is part and parcel of their parental authority over their children or wards.<br><br><i>Mootness of the petition</i><br><br>It must be noted that the present petition stems from the Quezon City Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Order dated November 8, 2005 <i>dismissing</i> the case for violation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610. Stated differently, an information has already been filed in court, arrest warrants have been issued, and bail bonds have been posted by the herein respondents. At that point in time, therefore, the People of the Philippines had become a party to the case, since the action had passed from the investigation phase to the trial phase with the filing of the information before the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> However, it also bears emphasizing that <i>no appeal</i> from the aforesaid order was filed on behalf of the People of the Philippines. Sr. Versoza filed the appeal on her own without impleading or involving the People. The crux of the present petition, therefore, is the propriety of Sr. Versoza's filing of an appeal from the dismissal of the criminal case for violation of R.A. No. 7610 without impleading the People of the Philippines. Stated differently, <i>does Sr. Versoza, acting alone and in her personal capacity, have standing to appeal the dismissal of the criminal case for violation of R.A. No. 7610</i>?<br><br>As discussed in the Resolution, Sr. Versoza's right to appeal the dismissal of the case is personal to her. It is distinct and separate from the People's right to appeal as the designated plaintiff in criminal prosecutions — a right it chose not to exercise in the case at bar. Therefore, upon Sr. Versoza's demise, the issue of whether or not she can appeal the dismissal in her personal capacity has been rendered moot and academic.<br><br><i>Parental authority as a "primary and<br>natural right"</i><br><br>The 1987 Constitution "recognizes the Filipino family as the foundation of the nation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As such it commits the State to the "strengthen[ing of] the« family as a basic <b><u>autonomous</u></b> social institution".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> To further this State policy, the Constitution vests upon parents the "natural and primary right"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to rear their children. This right is reiterated in the Child and Youth Welfare Code, which expressly provides that parents have, "in relation to all other persons or institutions dealing with the child's development, the primary right and obligation to provide for their upbringing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The primary and natural right of parents to rear their children is fleshed out in the Family Code, in the form of the juridical institution known as parental authority, or patria potestas, whereby parents rightfully assume control and protection of their unemancipated children to the extent required by the latter's needs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Parental authority has been defined as the mass of rights and obligations which parents have in relation to the person and property of their children. This authority lasts until the children's majority age or emancipation, and even after this under certain circumstances. Parental authority is granted for the purpose of the children's physical preservation and development, the cultivation of their intellect, and the education of their heart and senses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>As originally conceived in Roman law, parental authority was vested primarily in the father and amounted to a "near absolute right to his children, whom he viewed as chattel, a right with which courts were powerless to interfere."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Such right included the "power of life and death" (<i>Jus vitae ac necis</i>) over children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Over time, as recognition of children's rights expanded, <i>patria potestas</i> rights have been gradually reduced, first yielding some authority to the state as <i>parens patriae</i>; and later becoming subject to the <i>best interest of the child</i> standard. This modern conception of patria potestas animates the provisions of the Family Code. Nevertheless, the Family Code still reiterates the primary and natural right to parental child-rearing, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Article 209. Pursuant to the <u><b>natural right and duty</b></u> of parents over the person and property of their unemancipated children, parental authority and responsibility shall include the caring for and rearing them for civic consciousness and efficiency and the development of their moral, mental and physical character and well-being.</blockquote>The constitutional and statutory affirmation of the primacy of parental authority reiterates a self-evident fact: that parents are the primary caregivers and stewards of their children. Thus, courts have declared that, as a general rule, parental authority is superior to the power of the state over its minor citizens as <i>parens patriae</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In <i>Sps. Imbong, et al. v. Hon. Ochoa, Jr., et al.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this Court struck down a provision of the Reproductive Health Law which dispensed with parental consent for access to modern methods of family planning if the minor is already a parent or has suffered a miscarriage for "disregarding] and disobey[ing] the constitutional mandate that the natural and primary right and duty of parents in the rearing of the youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character shall receive the support of the Government." The Court cited 1986 Constitutional Commission member Fr. Joaquin Bernas:<br><blockquote>The 1987 provision has added the adjective "primary" to modify the right of parents. It imports the assertion that the right of parents is superior to that of the State, x x x The State cannot, without a compelling state interest, take over the role of parents in the care and custody of a minor child, whether or not the latter is already a parent or has had a miscarriage. Only a compelling state interest can justify a state substitution of their parental authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>This pronouncement was repeated in <i>Samahan ng mga Progresibong, Kabataan, et al. v. Quezon City, et al,</i> involving the constitutionality of curfew ordinances passed by three Metro Manila local governments, thus:<br><blockquote>By history and tradition, "the parental role implies a substantial measure of authority over one's children." In <i>Ginsberg v. New York</i>, the Supreme Court of the United States (US) remarked that "constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents' claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children is basic in the structure of our society." As in our Constitution, the right and duty of parents to rear their children is not only described as "natural," but also as "primary." The qualifier "primary" connotes the parents' superior right over the State in the upbringing of their children, x x x As our Constitution itself provides, the State is mandated to support parents in the exercise of these rights and duties. State authority is therefore, not exclusive of, but rather, complementary to parental supervision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote>Justice Leonen, in his Separate Opinion, concurred with these propositions and went on to state that:<br><blockquote>The addition of the qualifier "primary" unequivocally attests to the constitutional intent to afford primacy and preeminence to parental responsibility. More plainly stated, the Constitution now recognizes the superiority of parental prerogative. It follows, then, that state interventions, which are tantamount to deviations from the preeminent and superior rights of parents, are permitted only in instances where the parents themselves have failed or have become incapable of performing their duties.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As it stands, the <b><u>doctrine of <i>parens patriae</i> is a mere substitute or supplement to parents' authority over their children. It operates only when parental authority is established to be absent or grossly deficient</u></b>. The wisdom underlying this doctrine considers the existence of harm and the subsequent inability of the person to protect himself or herself. This premise entails the incapacity of parents and/or legal guardians to protect a child.<br><br>To hold otherwise is to afford an overarching and almost absolute power to the State; to allow the Government to arbitrarily exercise its <i>parens patriae</i> power might as well render the superior Constitutional right of parents inutile.<br><br>More refined applications of this doctrine reflect this position. In these instances where the State exercised its powers over minors on account of <i>parens patriae</i>, it was only because the children were prejudiced and it was without subverting the authority of the parents themselves when they have not acted in manifest offense against the rights of their children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><i>Parental authority vis-a-vis standing<br>under Republic Act No. 7610</i><br><br>The plenary and natural right of parental authority is vested primarily in the parent or guardian,15 subject only to substitution <i>in case of default of the parent or guardian</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> or to the creation of special parental authority under certain circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Parental authority is therefore vested first and foremost in the parent or guardian, and is only lost, transferred or supplemented in accordance with law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Article 189(2) of the Family Code and Rule 96, Section 1 of the Rules of Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Article 189. Adoption shall have the following effects:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(2) The <b><u>parental authority of the parents by nature over the adopted shall terminate and be vested in the adopters</u></b>, except that if the adopter is the spouse of the parent by nature of the adopted, parental authority over the adopted shall be exercised jointly by both spouses; x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br><div align="center">RULE 96<br><br>General Powers and Duties of Guardians<br></div><br>SECTION 1.

The guardian of the estate of a nonresident shall have the management of all the estate of the ward within the Philippines, and no court other than that in which such guardian was appointed shall have jurisdiction over the guardianship.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote>The law is clear: adoption or guardianship transfers the full panoply of parental rights and duties to the adoptive parent or guardian, subject only to specific exceptions as provided for by law. Thus, once a licensed child-caring institution has transferred the custody of a child to a judicially constituted guardian, the right of the institution's representative to sue on behalf of the child ceases, except as provided for by law. In the case at bar, it has been established that the spouses Pedro and Lourdes Aguirre have been granted parental authority over Larry by virtue of the June 19, 1986 decision of the RTC of Balanga, Bataan. The judicial declaration of the spouses Aguirre's guardianship over Larry therefore had the effect of divesting Sr. Versoza and the Heart of Mary Villa of parental authority over Larry. Therefore, Sr. Versoza's standing to file a complaint. for child abuse on Larry's behalf can only be based on the provision on standing under R.A. No. 7610<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and not on the parental authority provisions of the Family Code.<br><br>I therefore take exception to the assertion in the Resolution that "the argument that all ties have been severed between Larry and the child-caring agency to which [Sr. Versoza] belonged on account of the transfer of parental authority does not hold water",<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> for it confuses the parental right to represent a child with standing to file a complaint under R.A. No. 7610. R.A. No. 7610's provision on standing was created precisely to address circumstances where child abuse is committed under the guise of parental authority. This grant of standing to sue on behalf of abused children is purely statutory in nature and is distinct and separate from the parents' or guardians' right to represent their children.<br><br><i>Scope and limitations of parental authority</i><br><br>American courts, in interpreting the term "custody,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> have conceded that the "complex of rights" embraced thereby have "no precise contours."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It has been held that parents with custody and control of their children have "the right to make all reasonable decisions for control and proper functioning of the family as a harmonious social unit,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> including the right to "make decisions regarding care and control, education, health, and religion."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Under contemporary law, parental authority remains a plenary authority whose scope is almost all-encompassing, subject only to the limitations expressly provided for by statute and by the best interests standard.

Pursuant to the <b><u>natural right and duty</u></b> of parents over the person and property of their unemancipated children, parental authority and responsibility shall include the <b><u>caring for and rearing them for civic consciousness and efficiency and the development of their moral, mental and physical character and well-being.<br><br></u></b>x x x x<br><br>Chapter 3.

Thus, under the aforecited provision, included in these "other duties as are imposed by law" is the duty and authority of parents or guardians to decide for their intellectually disabled children or wards on matters regarding the use of health services.<br><br>Section 10 of the Mental Health Law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> lays down concrete guidelines regarding the consent of "persons with lived experience of any mental health condition including persons who require, or are undergoing psychiatric, neurologic or psychosocial care"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to medical treatment, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SECTION 10.

Nevertheless, as the natural and primary caregiver and custodian of their children, with the inherent right and duty "to develop their moral, mental and physical character and well-being" and "to represent them in all matters affecting their interests," parents are entitled to a presumption of good faith in the discharge of their <i>patria potestas</i> duties. However, the best interests of the child remain the paramount consideration, which the State, as <i>parens patriae</i> must promote; and to which, parental authority must yield in case of conflict. The sterilization of an intellectually disabled person, who is considered a child in the eyes of the law, presents one such instance, where the interests of the parents in ensuring the health and well-being of their child could conflict with the interests of the state in upholding the child's right to reproductive choice and corporal self-control. Thus, in the absence of allegations or proof that the parents acted in bad faith or against the best interests of their child, their right and duty to decide on their child's behalf must prevail.<br><i><br>The right to consent to sterilization of<br>an intellectually disabled person</i><br><br>The sterilization of intellectually disabled individuals has been the subject of a long line of decisions in the United States and Canada,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> almost all of which involved the parent or guardian of an intellectually disabled individual applying for judicial authorization to perform some medical procedure which will render said individual unable to procreate; and in most instances since 1978, the appellate courts have either denied such applications<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; or remanded them to the lower court for the reception of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In this regard, the Canadian Supreme Court has held that:<br><blockquote>The court undoubtedly has the right and duty to protect those who are unable to take care of themselves, and in doing so it has a wide discretion to do what it considers to be in their best interests. But this function must not, in my view, be transformed so as to create a duty obliging the court, at the behest of a third party, to make a choice between the two alleged constitutional rights—the right to procreate or not to procreate—simply because the individual is unable to make that choice. All the more so since, in the case of non-therapeutic sterilization as we saw, the choice is one the courts cannot safely exercise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>It must be noted that the North American courts unanimously recognize reproductive rights, including the right to choose to (or <i>not </i>to) undergo sterilization, as a fundamental human right, held by <i>all </i>individuals regardless of intellectual or mental ability. The doctrinal divergence lies not in the exercise of this right by intellectually disabled individuals, who, by reason of such disability, are unable to do so. Rather, the issues primarily revolve around whether the State should defer to the parents' wishes or substitute its own judgment as <i>parens patriae</i> on the individual's behalf; not the capacity of the individual to decide for himself or herself. The difficulties faced by the courts in resolving such matters have been summarized thusly:<br><blockquote>The case before us presents a situation that is difficult to characterize as either "compulsory" or "voluntary." "Compulsory" would refer to a sterilization that the state imposes despite objections by the person to be sterilized or one who represents his interests. Here, however, Lee Ann's parents and her guardian <i>ad litem</i> all agree that sterilization is in her best interests, and while the state may be acting in the constitutional sense, it would not be compelling sterilization. Lee Ann herself can comprehend neither the problem nor the proposed solution; without any such understanding it is difficult to say that sterilization would be against her will. Yet for this same reason, the label "voluntary" is equally inappropriate. Since Lee Ann is without the capacity for giving informed consent, any explanation of the proposed sterilization could only mislead her. Thus, what is proposed for Lee Ann is best described as neither "compulsory" nor "voluntary," but as lacking personal consent because of a legal disability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>As such, in the absence of comprehensive evidence regarding the individual's physical and mental capacities, sexual proclivity, and psycho-social capabilities to discharge the duties of a parent,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> courts in the United States have refrained from making such a choice in place of the intellectually disabled person. Ultimately, the determination of the most proper course of action would be an evidentiary matter that requires the reception of evidence and presentation of proof. In making such a determination, courts have considered evidence regarding the following factors: the intellectually disabled person's capacity to consent to the procedure;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> their capability to reproduce;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> their religious beliefs;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> their present and future inability to understand the concepts of reproduction or contraception, and the likely permanence of such inability;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> their ability to care for a child, either alone, or with the assistance of a prospective spouse;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> possible trauma or psychological damage that may be brought on by childbirth or parenthood;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> likelihood of voluntary engagement in sexual activity or exposure to situations where sexual intercourse is imposed;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> advisability of sterilization at the time of the application rather than in the future;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> evidence of scientific advances which may occur within the foreseeable future which will make possible either improvement of the individual's condition or alternative and less drastic sterilization procedures;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and a demonstration that the proponents of sterilization are seeking it in good faith, with the best interests of the individual in mind, rather than their own or the public's convenience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><i>The case at bar</i><br><br>It is undisputed that Larry Aguirre is considered a child under the law, since his mental age is that of an 8-year old;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and he is incapable of making important life decisions on his own.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Likewise, the parties do not dispute that respondent Pedro Aguirre acquired parental authority over Larry's person by virtue of the June 19, 1986 decision of the RTC of Balanga, Bataan, which granted the spouses Pedro and Lourdes Aguirre joint guardianship over Larry's person and property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The record likewise establishes that Larry has been in the care and custody of the Aguirre family since he was two years old.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It is therefore clear that the Aguirre spouses had parental authority over Larry. Consequently, they have the primary right and duty, under current laws, to decide what is best for Larry.<br><br>Turning now to the particular circumstances of Larry's situation, viewed in the light of the relevant factors mentioned in the preceding section, the undisputed findings made by Dr. Pascual in her Psychiatric Report, as cited in the case of <i>Aguirre v. Secretary of Justice</i>, must be accorded great weight. According to the report, Larry's mental development has been significantly delayed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> because of mild to moderate mental deficiency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, his human figure is comparable to a seven or eight year old child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He can perform most daily activities without assistance but still needs supervision to bathe.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> He cannot prepare meals on his own and is not allowed to go out or run errands alone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> He has no friends and only has significant relationships with his adoptive family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> He has learned to smoke and drink but has no history of substance abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> As such, he is very much dependent on his family for his needs, adaptive functioning, direction, and in making major life decisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Finally, the report concluded that, at his capacity, Larry may never understand the nature, foreseeable risks, benefits, and consequences of the vasectomy sought by his parents for his protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In contrast, there is no evidence on record to show that Larry understands the nature and consequences of his sexuality, his present and future inability to understand the concepts of reproduction or contraception; or of his ability to care for a child, either alone, or with the assistance of a prospective spouse. No evidence was likewise presented as to the possibility of trauma or psychological damage that may be brought on Larry by the fact of childbirth or parenthood; or of the likelihood of his voluntary engagement in sexual activity or exposure to situations where sexual intercourse is imposed; much more of the <i>ponencia</i>'s claim that Larry's mental age will grow to be 18 years of age or beyond at some point in the future, or its theory of "supported parenting."<br><br>Given the dearth of evidence to guide the courts in deciding on Larry's behalf, they must defer to the parties with the constitutional primary right to decide for Larry: his parents. The parental authority vested in the spouses Aguirre includes the right to decide upon and consent to a vasectomy, on Larry's behalf, as a precautionary measure to ensure that Larry is able to live his best life, free from the possible complications and repercussions which may arise if he bears a child under the attendant circumstances in the case at bar. Such decisions should be presumed to have been made in Larry's best interest, unless proven otherwise.<br><br>All told, a binding resolution of the novel issue raised by the <i>ponencia</i> must await another case where an authorized trier of fact will be able to receive evidence from all parties concerned, hopefully with the guidance of medical, sociological, and psychological experts, and guided by international precedents.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the petition solely on the ground of mootness.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> On this point, the trial court indicated its recognition of the fact that the action had passed into the trial phase when held in its November 8, 2005 Order that: "As to the first issue of whether or not the case should be dismissed, the Court finds merit to grant the motion."

It "involves legal custody (decision-making authority) and physical custody (caregiving authority), and an award of custody usually grants both rights. In a divorce or separation proceeding between the parents, the court usually awards custody to one of them, unless both are found to be unfit, in which case the court may award custody to a third party, typically a relative. In a case involving parental dereliction, such as abuse or neglect, the court may award custody to the state for placing the child in foster care if no responsible relative or family friend is willing and able to care for the child."
