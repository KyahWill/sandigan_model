Porciuncula, Jr. testified for the prosecution. On the other hand, only appellant testified for the defense. </p><p> <b>The Prosecution's Evidence</b> </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Rhey Gonzales</b> </p> <p> He was the eldest among appellant's four children and the brother of Ronald Gonzales. Their father was already dead. At the time of the incident, he was fifteen years old while Ronald was thirteen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p> <p> On September 16, 2009, around 7 o'clock in the evening, he and Ronald got home from school. Appellant also got home from work around the same time. Shortly after, she discovered they had no current in the house because Ronald sold the bronze wire connected to the electric meter. Then, appellant's co-workers came to fetch her. When she came back home, she was drunk. Using a hanger, she hit Ronald several times until the hanger snapped. Still, she did not stop. She got hold of the broom and using its wooden handle, hit Ronald's head and body. At that time, Rhey was lying on the lower bunk of their double-deck bed. He cried when he saw what was going on. His two other siblings Racel and Raymart also cried.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p> <p> When Rhey woke up around 6 o'clock the next morning, he saw vomit on Ronald's bed and his jogging pants were wet with urine. Ronald could not eat and looked very weak. Meanwhile, appellant asked Ronald why he sold the bronze electrical wire. Ronald confessed he sold the bronze electrical wire because he needed money for his project. She then again took hold of the broom and inserted its handle into Ronald's mouth. Later in the evening, when Rhey arrived home, he learned that their aunt Glena Gonzales brought Ronald to the East Avenue Medical Center. Together with his uncle Teody Gonzales, he went to the hospital to check Ronald's condition. Ronald died around 10 o'clock in the evening of September 17, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p> <p> <b>Racel Gonzales</b> </p> <p> She was the younger sister of Ronald. She was eleven years old at the time of the incident. She saw appellant scold and hit Ronald with a hanger while he lay on the bed. Appellant hit Ronald's legs, arms, and head with the handle. The following morning, she saw vomit on Ronald's mouth, on the bed, and on the floor. She also noticed that Ronald was very weak. Later in the afternoon, she went to the East Avenue Medical Center to visit Ronald. Appellant was at the hospital when Ronald was pronounced dead.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p> <p> <b>Glena Gonzales</b> </p> <p> She was appellant's sister-in-law and Ronald's aunt. They were neighbors. About 9 o'clock in the morning of September 17, 2009, she went to appellant's house. Only appellant and Ronald were there. She saw Ronald unconscious and very pale. When she could not feel Ronald's pulse, she carried him shouting they should bring him to the hospital. Appellant replied that Ronald was just pretending. Together with a certain Mommy Ludy, she rushed Ronald to Tiga Clinic in Manggahan where he was given oxygen. Appellant remained in the house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p> <p> After an hour, the clinic caretaker told them to transfer Ronald to the East Avenue Medical Center. There, the doctor said Ronald was comatosed and only had 50% chance of survival. Ronald died around 11 o'clock in the evening.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p> <p><b>Dr. Filemon C. Porciuncula, Jr.</b> </p> <p> He was the Medico-Legal Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory who examined Ronald's body on September 18, 2009. He found that Ronald sustained one external injury (swelling) and one internal injury (brain hemorrhage). In his expert opinion, the injuries were caused by a forcible blow using a blunt object. The direct cause of death was a blood clot in his head.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The possibility that the deceased sustained it because he fell from a high elevation was very remote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <b>The Defense's Evidence</b> </p><p> Appellant testified that on September 16, 2009, around 5:30 in the afternoon, she got home but it was dark inside. Racel told her Ronald cut the electrical wiring and sold it. When Ronald arrived from school, he admitted selling the copper wire to buy something. She ordered him to lay his hands on the table. She hit them once with a hanger. Racel and Raymart<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> saw her hit Ronald's hands. It was painful for her as a mother so she went out and returned around 9 o'clock in the evening. At that time, her children were already asleep. She hugged Ronald and told him, "<i>pasensia ka na kong nasaktan kita, kasi kasalanan mo</i>." She went to sleep shortly after.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> Early the next day, she heard a noise and saw Ronald sitting and leaning on the ladder of the double-deck bed. When she asked what happened, Ronald said he slipped and fell. Ronald went to the comfort room and went back to sleep. About 5 o'clock in the morning, she told Rhey to wake up Ronald. At that time, Ronald was vomiting. She gave Ronald a hot drink thinking her son was "<i>nalamigan</i>." Meantime, Rhey left to bring Racel to school. When he returned, she told him to help Ronald take a bath. After the bath, Ronald lay on the bed while she washed clothes outside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> When she noticed that Ronald was very weak, she told him to go to his Tita Glena's house. Glena brought Ronald to the clinic for treatment. They were told though that his heartbeat was very weak and they needed to bring him to the hospital. She followed them to the clinic, and together with Glena, brought Ronald to the East Avenue Medical Center. Between 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock in the evening, Ronald died.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Trial Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> As borne by Judgment dated May 20, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the trial court rendered a verdict of conviction, <i>viz</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Salve Gonzales y Torno, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Parricide defined and penalized under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code and she is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perputua (sic) and to indemnify private complainants the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The trial court found that the elements of parricide were all present in the case. Rhey and Racel Gonzales positively testified that appellant severely beat up their brother Ronald first with a hanger until it broke, and then, with the broom's wooden handle. Appellant hit Ronald all over his body, including his head. This caused traumatic injuries which resulted in Ronald's death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals</b> </p><p> On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for finding her guilty of parricide despite the prosecution's alleged failure to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. She denied killing her son. She insisted Ronald just slipped.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> She also argued that even assuming she killed Ronald, the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong must be appreciated in her favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), through Assistant Solicitor General Karl B. Miranda and Senior State Solicitor Noel Cezar T. Segovia<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> countered that the straightforward testimonies of the prosecution witnesses clearly established that appellant's acts toward her thirteen-year old son were sadistic, not just corrective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Her defense of denial cannot outweigh her children's positive testimonies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Lastly, the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong cannot favor appellant since there was no notable disparity between the means she employed in beating up Ronald and the resulting injuries which caused his death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Court of Appeal's Ruling</b> </p><p> The Court of Appeals affirmed. It held that appellant's defense of denial cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of her own children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Also, the mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong cannot work in appellant's favor since her acts were reasonably sufficient to cause Ronald's death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Present Appeal</b> </p><p> Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for her acquittal. In compliance with Resolution dated June 17, 2015,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> both appellant and the OSG manifested that, in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs filed before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling</b> </p><p> We deny the appeal. </p><p> <b><i>Parricide and its elements proven</i></b> </p><p> Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code defines parricide, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Article 246. </b>Parricide. — Any person who shall kill his father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or any of his ascendants, or descendants, or his spouse, shall be guilty of parricide and shall be punished by the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death.</p> </blockquote> <p> Parricide is committed when (1) a person is killed; (2) the accused is the killer; and (3) deceased is either the legitimate spouse of the accused, or any legitimate or illegitimate parent, child, ascendant or descendant of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Here, the presence of the <b>third element</b> is undisputed.

These children would not impute such a heinous crime as parricide on their own mother if it were not true. More so because these children, young as they were, only had appellant to take care of them as their father had already died.
