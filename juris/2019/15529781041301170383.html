It is elementary that alibi and denial are outweighed by positive identification that is categorical, consistent and untainted by any ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Aside from that, where there is the least possibility of the presence of the accused at the crime scene, the alibi will not hold water.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The arguments raised by accused-appellants which assail Mary Ann's testimony lack merit. They argued that, when Mary Ann saw accused­ appellant Casemiro, she initially did not recognize him and was able to pinpoint him as the culprit only the following day. However, the claim that Mary Ann only positively identified them through what other people said was uncorroborated and self-serving.<br><br>The argument that Mary Ann could not have witnessed the incident likewise deserves scant consideration since no proof was shown that Mary Ann's vision was hindered by the lighting condition. There was no allegation that the vision of the eyewitness had been obstructed, or that her distance from the crime scene had effectively impaired her ability to identify the perpetrators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Normally, where conditions of visibility are favorable and the witness does not appear to be biased, her assertion as to the identity of the malefactors should be accepted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This is more so when the witness is a near relative because witnesses such as she usually strive to remember the faces of the assailants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Finally, their argument regarding Mary Ann's reaction after the incident - she left her husband without even checking if he was still alive - is similarly bereft of merit in light of the pronouncement of this Court that there is no standard behavior or reaction for people who witness traumatic events such as the death of a common-law husband, as in this case. For it is settled "that different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling or frightful experience."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants also assail their conviction for murder after the lower courts found the qualifying circumstance of treachery.<br><br>For this Court to appreciate treachery, it must be shown that offenders employed means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime that tend directly and especially to ensure its execution without risk to themselves arising from the defense which the victim might make.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In the instant case, the accused-appellants invited the victim under the pretense of butchering a duck and brought him to a place where there were no houses nearby in the middle of the night; the victim was unarmed while accused-appellants wielded a knife and an ice pick; the victim was stabbed multiple times on the chest, held by the arms by the other, and again stabbed multiple times on the back even after he had fallen down. These circumstances indubitably prove treachery; execution of the attack gave the victim no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate, and said means of execution was deliberately adopted by accused-appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the trial court made a pronouncement on the presence of abuse of superior strength. The CA also stated that there was abuse of superior strength but that this would only be absorbed by treachery. This Court finds the pronouncements unnecessary considering that abuse of superior strength was not even alleged in the Information. An aggravating circumstance, even if proven during trial, cannot affect an accused-­appellant's liability when the Information fails to allege such circumstance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, it was not proper for the lower courts to make a pronouncement on the presence of the circumstance of abuse of superior strength. Be that as it may, the crime was already qualified by the circumstance of treachery which was alleged and proven by the prosecution.<br><br>The crime of murder qualified by treachery is penalized under Article 248 of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. Accused-appellants were meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> by the trial court which the CA affirmed. This Court finds the imposition and subsequent affirmance thereof in order.<br><br>As to the award of damages, prevailing jurisprudence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> directs the payment to the heirs of the victim the amounts of P75,000.00 as moral damages; P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and P50,000.00 as temperate damages, as well as the payment of interest at 6% <i>per annum</i> on all amounts from finality of the Decision until full payment. These amounts have been properly decreed by the appellate court when it affirmed the ruling of the trial court with modification. Thus, we see no reason to modify further the assailed ruling of the appellate court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.
