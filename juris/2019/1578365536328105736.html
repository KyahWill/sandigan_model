				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The doctrine of qualified political agency acknowledges the multifarious executive responsibilities that demand a president's attention, such that the delegation of control power to his or her Cabinet becomes a necessity. Unless the Constitution or law provides otherwise, Cabinet members have the president's imprimatur to exercise control over the offices and departments under their respective jurisdictions, which authority nonetheless remains subject to the president's disapproval or reversal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><p> This Court resolves a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> challenging the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Commission on Audit, which upheld the validity of Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(06-10) disallowing the Philippine Institute for Development Studies' procurement of group healthcare maintenance totaling P1,647,235.06.</p><p> On June 11, 1978, former President Ferdinand E. Marcos (Marcos) issued Presidential Decree No. 1597,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which provided, among others, that government employees may be granted allowances, honoraria, and other fringe benefits, subject to the approval of the President. It read: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. Allowances, Honoraria, and Other Fringe Benefits. Allowances, honoraria and other fringe benefits which may be granted to government employees, whether payable by their respective offices or by other agencies of government, shall be subject to the approval of the President upon recommendation of the Commissioner of the Budget. For this purpose, the Budget Commission shall review on a continuing basis and shall prepare, for the consideration and approval of the President, policies and levels of allowances and other fringe benefits applicable to government personnel, including honoraria or other forms of compensation for participation in projects which are authorized to pay additional compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Pursuant to this provision, former President Fidel V. Ramos issued Administrative Order No. 402,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which authorized government agencies and government-owned and controlled corporations to establish an annual medical checkup program: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. Establishment of the Annual Medical Check-up Program. An annual medical check-up for government officials and employees is hereby authorized to be established starting this year, in the meantime that this benefit is not yet integrated under the National Health Insurance Program being administered by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In conformity with Section 6 of Administrative Order No. 402,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Department of Health, Department of Budget and Management, and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) issued Joint Circular No. 01-98, which enumerated the examinations to be included in the annual medical checkup program, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Sometime in 1999, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, through its former Acting President Mario B. Lambarte, wrote then Health Secretary Alberto G. Romualdez (Health Secretary Romualdez) and PhilHealth. It requested that it be authorized to establish a health maintenance program in the form of a free annual medical checkup through their membership in a private health maintenance organization, in lieu of the annual medical checkup under Administrative Order No. 402.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> In an August 31, 1999 letter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> then Health Secretary Romualdez sought the Department of Budget and Management's opinion on whether the Philippine Institute for Development Studies may be exempted from the coverage of Joint Circular No. 01-98. He expressed in the letter, however, that he had no objection to the request.</p><p> In its September 30, 1999 letter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> PhilHealth, through Senior Vice President Reynaldo N. Dalma, Jr., informed the Philippine Institute for Development Studies that, like the Department of Health, it had no objection to the request. </p><p> Similarly, in a January 20, 2000 letter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Department of Budget and Management, through Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno, expressed that it had no objection to the request. However, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies was advised that since the medical checkup program's establishment was made through an administrative order issued by the President, it must likewise seek exemption from the Office of the President. </p><p> Thus, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies sought the President's approval.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> On March 1, 2000, the Office of the President, through Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Ramon B. Cardenas (Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Cardenas), responded: </p><blockquote> <p> Upon the recommendation of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department of Health (DOH) and <em>Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC)</em>, please be informed that the request of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) for establishment of an <em><strong>Annual Medical Check-Up Program</strong></em> thru enrollment with duly accredited Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO), in lieu of the Annual Medical Health Program authorized under Administrative Order No. 402, dated 2 June 1998, as implemented by DOH-DBM-PHIC Joint Circular No. 01, dated 9 September 1998,<em><strong> is hereby approved</strong></em>, <em>subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Armed with the Office of the President's approval, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies executed a Health Care Agreement with PhilamCare Health System, Inc. (PhilamCare) on April 19, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Under the agreement, PhilamCare would provide 54 employees of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies with outpatient, hospitalization, and emergency services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> Upon post-audit, the Audit Team Leader issued Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2005-001 finding that the payment to PhilamCare was contrary to Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001. The Philippine Institute for Development Studies was directed to discontinue further payment for the transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> In a letter-reply, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies argued that the procurement of the health maintenance program from PhilamCare was undertaken pursuant to Administrative Order No. 402.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> On April 25, 2006, after further evaluation, the Legal and Adjudication Office-Corporate issued Notice of Disallowance No. PIDS 2006-01 to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies. The notice disallowed the amount of P324,700.01, which represented the annual membership fees of its 54 employees under the Health Care Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> In a June 19, 2007 Decision, the Legal and Adjudication Office-Corporate affirmed this disallowance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies filed before the Commission on Audit a Petition for Review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The Petition was eventually denied in a February 16, 2012 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which the Philippine Institute for Development Studies then assailed before this Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in a case docketed as G.R. No. 200838. This Court, in a April 21, 2015 Unsigned Resolution, found that the Petition lacked merit. </p><p> Meanwhile, as the Commission on Audit's resolution on Notice of Disallowance PIDS No. 2006-01 was still pending, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies again wrote the Office of the President on March 19, 2007. It requested authority for the continued implementation of its health maintenance program from 2005 onwards notwithstanding the issuance of Notice of Disallowance PIDS No. 2006-01.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> The Office of the President referred the letter to then Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III (Health Secretary Duque) and then Budget Secretary Rolando Andaya, Jr. (Budget Secretary Andaya) for recommendation and appropriate action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> Acting on the Office of the President's endorsement, Health Secretary Duque recommended<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the continued implementation of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies' health maintenance program. </p><p> Budget Secretary Andaya<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> likewise recommended that the Philippine Institute for Development Studies be granted authority to continue the implementation of its annual medical checkup program through enrollment in duly accredited health maintenance organizations from 2005 onwards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> Meanwhile, in its July 13, 2007 letter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> PhilHealth informed the Philippine Institute for Development Studies that it has not yet included the annual medical checkup in the benefit package it was developing: </p><blockquote> <p> Please be informed that in our opinion, this is not within the authority of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) to make recommendations whether or not a government institution like the PIDS should continue implementing their Health Maintenance Program. The issue, we believe is between PIDS and Office of the President, who has sole authority to grant or not to grant the request. </p> <p> <i>We have written your office in 2006 informing that we have not yet included the annual medical check up in the benefit packages being developed by PhilHealth, and this situation is still existing up to now.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the Department of Health's and the Department of Budget and Management's recommendations, the Office of the President, through Executive Secretary Eduardo R. Ermita (Executive Secretary Ermita), finally granted the Philippine Institute for Development Studies' request to continue implementing their annual medical checkup program through enrollment with duly accredited health maintenance organizations. As with the previous approval, this also came with the same condition that it is subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies continued to implement its health maintenance program and eventually executed healthcare agreements with different insurance companies from 2006 to 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> All the procurements totaled P1,647,235.06.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> This amount, however, was disallowed upon audit by the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor in Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(6-10) dated May 23, 2011. The amount was disallowed for being violative of the February 3, 2005 Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001, which the Audit Team Leader and Supervising Auditor said prohibits the procurement of healthcare insurance from private agencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> Aggrieved, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies appealed before the Commission on Audit's Corporate Government Sector Cluster C (COS-Cluster C).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> In its August 11, 2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the COS-Cluster C granted the appeal and lifted Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(6-10). </p><p> As per protocol, the August 11, 2011 Decision was elevated to the Commission on Audit Proper for automatic review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> In its March 18, 2014 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Commission on Audit Proper set the CGS-Cluster C's Decision aside and upheld the validity of Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(06-10).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> In so ruling, the Commission on Audit Proper noted that Administrative Order No. 402 only provides government employees with a medical checkup program limited to diagnostic medical procedures, such as physical examination, chest x-ray, complete blood count, urinalysis, stool examination, and ECG.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Since the Philippine Institute for Development Studies entered into agreements that provide more than just medical checkups and include hospitalization, outpatient, and emergency benefits, their disallowance was deemed proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies' invocation of Commission on Audit Decision No. 2002-272, which lifted the disallowance of a similar benefit, was given scant consideration. The Commission on Audit Proper noted that the Decision was issued in 2002, when the prohibition under Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001 did not yet exist. Here, it noted, Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(06-10) was issued precisely for violation of the 2005 resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies filed this Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> under Rule 64 of the Rules of Court. With it comes a prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the Commission on Audit from enforcing its March 18, 2014 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner argues that the Commission on Audit erred in ruling that it violated Administrative Order No. 402. It stresses that the President, as an exercise of authority under Presidential Decree No. 1597, allowed it to avail of medical benefits other than those in the administrative order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> Petitioner further contends that the Commission on Audit Proper gravely erred when it applied Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner stresses that the healthcare insurance it acquired from health maintenance organizations cannot be considered as disbursement of public funds because PhilHealth itself, in its July 13, 2007 letter, informed petitioner that it has not yet included the annual medical checkup in the benefit package it was developing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p> Petitioner likewise contends that the Commission on Audit's March 18, 2014 Decision violates the constitutional guarantee to equal protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner cites <i>Province of Negros Occidental v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> where this Court set aside the Commission on Audit's disallowance of the Province of Negros' insurance premium payment to PhilamCare for hospitalization and health care benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It also again invokes the Commission on Audit's 2002 Decision, which lifted the disallowance of payment of group health insurance coverage for the Department of Labor and Employment and National Conciliation and Mediation Board employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> Claiming that its employees are similarly situated with their counterparts in the cited cases, petitioner asserts that the Commission on Audit's failure to rule in a similar manner violates its constitutional right to equal protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> Finally, petitioner stresses that even if Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(6-10) were valid, its officers and employees, who relied in good faith on the Department of Budget and Management's, the Department of Health's, and the Office of the President's approval, should be absolved of any liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> In this Court's June 3, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> a Temporary Restraining Order was issued enjoining the Commission on Audit from enforcing its March 18, 2014 Decision. The Commission on Audit was also required to comment on the Petition. </p><p> In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> respondent avers that the Office of the President's approval of petitioner's request to continue its annual medical checkup program came with the condition that it would be "subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Consequently, petitioner is required to comply with Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001 despite the approval from the Department of Health, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Office of the President.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><p> Respondent denies that petitioner's constitutional right to equal protection has been violated, arguing that petitioner's employees are not similarly situated with the employees in the cases it cited in the Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> Respondent likewise insists that petitioner's defense of good faith is unavailing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> In an August 12, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> this Court directed petitioner to reply to the Comment. </p><p> In its Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> petitioner argued that Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001 cannot supplant the President's constitutional prerogative to implement Presidential Decree No. 1597.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> In a November 18, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court directed the parties to file their respective memoranda. </p><p> In its Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> petitioner reiterates that the Commission on Audit erred in applying Administrative Order No. 402.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> It likewise maintains that Commission on Audit Resolution 2005-001 does not apply to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><p> Respondent, through the Office of the Solicitor General, manifested that it would be adopting its Comment as its Memorandum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> The principal issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not respondent Commission on Audit erred in upholding the validity of Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(6-10). </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> The cases petitioner cited, <i>Province of Negros Occidental</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and Commission on Audit Decision No. 2002-072, do not apply here. </p><p> The facts in <i>Province of Negros Occidental</i>, for one, are not analogous to the facts here. </p><p> There, petitioner Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Negros Occidental obtained health insurance coverage from PhilamCare, which agreed to provide the province's officials and employees with hospitalization and healthcare benefits. Upon post-audit investigation, the Provincial Auditor disallowed payment to PhilamCare for the petitioner's failure to obtain approval from the Office of the President, per Administrative Order No. 103. The disallowance was affirmed by the Commission on Audit, which ruled that the president's approval is required before a local government unit may grant additional benefits to its personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> In its September 28, 2010 Decision, this Court ruled that the petitioner did not violate Administrative Order No. 103. It found that the requirement needing the president's prior approval does not apply to local government units, but only "to departments, bureaus, offices[,] and government-owned and controlled corporations under the Executive branch."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><p> Here, unlike in <i>Province of Negros</i>, petitioner is not a local government unit, but a government-owned and controlled corporation which sought the President's approval before establishing its annual medical checkup program. It likewise sought the Office of the President's approval to continue the annual medical checkup program's implementation after Notice of Disallowance No. 2006-01 had been issued, which the petitioner in <i>Province of Negros</i> never did. </p><p> Evidently, <i>Province of Negros</i> cannot apply here. </p><p> Likewise misplaced is the invocation of Commission on Audit Decision No. 2002-072, which petitioner uses to argue that respondent's failure to decide its case in a similar manner violates its constitutional right to equal protection. </p><p> Contrary to petitioner's postulation, its employees are not similarly situated to the employees of the Department of Labor and Employment and the National Conciliation and Mediation Board. </p><p> The disallowance of the amount of P1,647,235.06, the total payment for petitioner's healthcare agreements with health maintenance organizations, was based on Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001, which precludes the procurement of healthcare insurance from private agencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the Commission on Audit Decision lifting the disallowance of Department of Labor and Employment and National Conciliation and Mediation Board was issued on March 14, 2002. Hence, the basis for the present disallowance did not yet exist when Commission on Audit Decision No. 2002-072 was issued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> On April 21, 2015, as this Petition was pending, this Court rendered an Unsigned Resolution in G.R. No. 200838, entitled <i>Philippine Institute for Development Studies v. Pulido Tan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It ruled that the agreement petitioner entered into with PhilamCare could not be allowed because it was considered an irregular expenditure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></p><p> This Court further decreed that, contrary to petitioner's argument, the approval for exemption issued by the Office of the President, through then Senior Deputy Executive Secretary Cardenas, did not exempt it from the provisions of Administrative Order No. 402. It held that the Senior Deputy Executive Secretary had no authority to exempt an agency from the application of an administrative order: </p><blockquote> <p> Also, the Court cannot agree with PIDS that when the OP approved its procurement of a health care package in lieu of that provided by the PHIC, it also exempted it from the said health program under A.O. No. 402. <i>The Senior Deputy Executive Secretary had no power or authority to declare an agency to be exempt from an administrative order or a presidential issuance and. thus. had no basis for approving the procurement of a private health care package.</i> Contrary to what he had stated in his letter of approval, the DOH, the PHIC and the DBM never made any recommendation pushing for an independent HMO. Instead, they merely stated that they "interpose no objection" to PIDS' plan of engaging a private HMO. In fact, in the DBM letter, then Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno stressed that its acquiescence would not be enough to exempt or excuse an agency from the operation of A.O. No. 402.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>THIS CASE IS DIFFERENT UNLIKE THE 2015 PHILIPPINE INSTITUTE FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES CASE, WHERE THE SENIOR DEPUTY EXECUTIVE SECRETARY GRANTED PETITIONER EXEMPTION FROM ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 402, HERE, THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY HIMSELF SIGNED THE LETTER ALLOWING PETITIONER TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTING ITS HEALTH MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</i>.</p><p> In his July 23, 2007 letter, Executive Secretary Ermita, acting by authority of the President, wrote: </p><blockquote> <p> Upon the recommendation of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and Department of Health (DOH), please be informed that the request of the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) for grant of authority for the continued implementation of their Annual Medical Check-Up Program thru enrollment with duly accredited Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) from 2005 onwards, in lieu of the Annual Medical Health Program authorized under Administrative Order No. 402, dated 02 June 1998, as implemented by DOH-DBMPHIC Joint Circular No. 01, dated 09 September 1998, is hereby approved, <i>subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The executive secretary wields such power that enables him or her to act on behalf of the president—though this position did not always have such authority, as its long history, tracing back to the Spanish era, will tell. </p><p> The Office of the Executive Secretary was first established in 1901. Created to assist in the then civil governor's executive duties, the office was led by an executive secretary with an assistant executive secretary as deputy. The executive secretary, who must be able to speak and write fluently in English and Spanish, acted as an "interpreter at all public sessions of the [Philippine] Commission when that body desires his presence"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> and supervised the translation of its laws.

In 1947, Executive Order No. 94 changed the title to executive secretary<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and further provided that the executive secretary "shall have the rank of a Secretary of Department and shall exercise such powers, functions, and duties as may be assigned to him by the President from time to time, and such others as may be imposed upon him by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></p><p> In 1975, then President Marcos abolished the positions of executive secretary, deputy executive secretary, and assistant executive secretary.

This means that the President of the Philippines is the Executive of the Government of the Philippines, and no other.

All executive authority is thus vested in him, and upon him devolves the constitutional duty of seeing that the laws are "faithfully executed." In the fulfillment of this duty which he cannot evade, he is granted specific and express powers and functions. In addition to these specific and express powers and functions, he may also exercise those necessarily implied and included in them. The National Assembly may not enact laws which either expressly or impliedly diminish the authority conferred upon the President of the Constitution.

This sort of constitutional interpretation would negate the very existence of <i>cabinet positions</i> and the respective expertise which the holders thereof are accorded and would unduly hamper the President's effectivity in running the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> But, in the same case, this Court expressly set limitations to the delegations of authority that can be properly covered by the doctrine of qualified political agency: </p><blockquote> <p> Nevertheless, there are powers vested in the President by the Constitution which may not be delegated to or exercised by an agent or <i>alter ego</i> of the President. Justice Laurel, in his <i>ponencia in Villena</i>, makes this clear: </p> <blockquote> <p> Withal, at first blush, the argument of ratification may seem plausible under the circumstances, it should be observed that there are certain acts which, by their very nature, cannot be validated by subsequent approval or ratification by the President. There are certain constitutional powers and prerogatives of the Chief Executive of the Nation which must be exercised by him in person and no amount of approval or ratification will validate the exercise of any of those powers by any other person. Such, for instance, in his power to suspend the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> and proclaim martial law (PAR. 3, SEC. 11, Art. VII) and the exercise by him of the benign prerogative of mercy (par. 6, sec. 11,<em> idem</em>). </p> </blockquote> <p> These distinctions hold true to this day. <em>There are certain presidential powers which arise out of exceptional circumstances, and if exercised, would involve the suspension of fundamental freedoms, or at least call for the supersedence of executive prerogatives over those exercised by co-equal branches of government. The declaration of martial law, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and the exercise of the pardoning power notwithstanding the judicial determination of guilt of the accused, all fall within this special class that demands the exclusive exercise by the President of the constitutionally vested power.

In that case, the doctrine was extended to cover the Assistant Regional Director as an <em>alter ego</em> of the Finance Secretary in fulfilling the latter's obligations under Sections 49 and 50 of the Local Tax Code. This Court stated: </p><blockquote> <p> Petitioners further fault the Municipal Treasurer for the latter's failure to furnish the Provincial Treasurer with a copy of Tax Ordinance No. 88-11-36 after its approval.

This doctrine is in recognition of the fact that in our presidential form of government, all executive organizations are adjuncts of a single Chief Executive; that the heads of the Executive Departments are assistants and agents of the Chief Executive; and that the multiple executive functions of the President as the Chief Executive are performed through the Executive Departments. The doctrine has been adopted here out of practical necessity, considering that the President cannot be expected to personally perform the multifarious functions of the executive office. </p> <p> But <em>the doctrine of qualified political agency could not be extended to the acts of the Board of Directors of TIDCORP despite some of its members being themselves the appointees of the President to the Cabinet</em>. Under Section 10 of Presidential Decree No. 1080, as further amended by Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8494, 24 the five ex officio members were the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Trade and Industry, the Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, and the Chairman of the Philippine Overseas Construction Board, while the four other members of the Board were the three from the private sector (at least one of whom should come from the export community), who were elected by the ex officio members of the Board for a term of not more than two consecutive years, and the President of TIDCORP who was concurrently the Vice-Chairman of the Board. Such Cabinet members sat on the Board of Directors of TIDCORP ex officio, or by reason of their office or function, not because of their direct appointment to the Board by the President.

Ermita (ES Ermita) through a July 23, 2007 letter by authority of the President.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> Respectfully, I am of the opinion that the doctrine of qualified political agency [<em>i.e</em>., whether the approval of the Office of the President (OP) is given by the ES or SDES] is not the issue ultimately determinative of the resolution of this case. </p><p> To recall, A.O. 402 authorized government agencies and government­ owned and -controlled corporations to establish an annual medical check-up program. Pursuant to this authorization, the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PHIC) issued Joint Circular No. 01-98 which, among others, enumerated the examinations to be included in the Annual Medical Check-Up Program. PIDS sought to establish an HMP in the form of a Free Annual Medical Check-Up through its membership in a private Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), in lieu of the Annual Medical Check-Up provided under A.O. 402. <b><u>The DOH, PHIC, and DBM interposed no objection</u></b>. Thus, the OP, through SDES Ramon B. Cardenas (SDES Cardenas), approved PIDS's HMP in lieu of that provided in A.O. 402, subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. Subsequently, PIDS entered into a Health Care Agreement (Agreement) with PhilamCare Health System, Inc. (PhilamCare).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> COA disallowed the amounts representing the annual membership fees of PIDS employees covered by the Agreement for violating COA Resolution No. 2005-001, which prohibits the procurement of healthcare insurance from private agencies. This matter reached the Court and was docketed as G.R. No. 200838 entitled <em>Philippine Institute for Development Studies v. Pulido Tan </em>(2015 PIDS case).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> Pending resolution of the disallowance, PIDS wrote the OP requesting authority to continue the implementation of its HMP. The OP referred the letter to the DOH, DBM, and PHIC. The DOH and DBM recommended its continuation, but the PHIC opined that it was not within its authority to make such recommendation. <b><u>Moreover, the PHIC informed PIDS that it has not yet included the annual medical check-up in the benefit packages being developed by PHIC</u></b>. Due to the favorable recommendations of the DOH and DBM, the OP, through ES Ermita, granted PIDS's request to continue the implementation of its HMP with the same condition that it is subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations. Thus, PIDS continued to implement its HMP and entered into healthcare agreements with different insurance companies. These became the subject of the disallowance in the instant case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p> Meanwhile, the Court affirmed the disallowance in the 2015 PIDS case. The Court also made a pronouncement that the "[SDES] had no power or authority to declare an agency to be exempt from an administrative order or a presidential issuance and, thus, had no basis for approving the procurement of a private health care package."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p>In granting the instant petition, the <em>ponencia</em> discussed the Court's ruling in the 2015 PIDS case, which was promulgated during the pendency of this case. The Court ruled therein that the agreement between PIDS and PhilamCare was properly disallowed by the COA for being an irregular expenditure because contrary to PIDS's argument, the approval for exemption issued by the OP, through then SDES Cardenas, did not exempt it from the provisions of A.O. 402. In particular, the SDES had no authority to declare an agency as exempt from an administrative order or a presidential issuance and, thus, had no basis for approving the procurement of a private healthcare package.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> In this regard, the <em>ponencia</em> stated that <u>unlike the 2015 PIDS case where it was <b>only the SDES</b> who granted PIDS's exemption from the coverage of A.O. 402, the signatory of the letter allowing PIDS to continue the implementation of its HMP is <b>ES Ermita himself</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The <em>ponencia</em> then went on to discuss the doctrine of qualified political agency and ruled that ES Ermita, being the President's alter ego, had the authority to grant PIDS authority to continue the implementation of its Annual Medical Check-Up Program through enrollment with HMOs, in lieu of those provided under A.O. 402. Thus, PIDS's exemption remained valid until disapproved or reprobated by the President.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> My disagreement with the <i>ponencia's ratio</i> focusing on the doctrine of qualified political agency is that it appears to make an unqualified distinction between the powers of the SDES and the ES to act by authority of the President. </p><p> A review of the records reveals that nowhere in the pleadings was the validity of the ES's authority in approving PIDS's request to continue its HMP ever put in issue. Coupled with the fact that the Court's statement in the 2015 PIDS case that the "SDES had no power or authority to declare an agency to be exempt from an administrative order or a presidential issuance and, thus, had no basis for approving the procurement of a private health care package"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> may not necessarily be accurate, this approach may have far-reaching and unintended consequences for the operations of the OP. </p><p> I agree fully with the <i>ponencia</i> that the power of the ES is found in the Administrative Code of 1987<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Administrative Code), particularly, Section 27, Sub-Chapter B, Chapter 9, Book III of the Administrative Code: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 27. <i>Functions of the Executive Secretary.</i> - The Executive Secretary shall, subject to the control and supervision of the President, carry out the functions assigned by law to the Executive Office and shall perform such other duties as may be delegated to him.

(Underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> This listing of the duties and responsibilities of the ES is clarified or streamlined through presidential issuances. In turn, these Memorandum Orders delineate or specify the functions of the ES, the SDES, and Deputy Executive Secretary (DES),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and at times, even specify the designated duties and responsibilities not merely of the functional positions, but of the specific persons occupying the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> An early example of such Presidential issuance is Letter of Instructions No. 238 dated January 1, 1975, which provides that"[o]nly the [ES] <u>and the [DES]</u> shall be empowered to sign by authority of the President when implementing and disseminating Presidential directives and policies."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Other Memorandum Orders authorize the SDES and DES to sign official papers (or act) "[b]y authority of the President."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Memorandum Order (MO) No. 28 dated August 14, 1992, provides: </p><blockquote> <p> The Senior Deputy Executive Secretary and the Deputy Executive Secretary are hereby empowered to sign the following official papers "By authority of the President," as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> I. The Senior Deputy Executive Secretary: </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p>3. <u>Transmittal and/or implementation of Presidential directives and instructions</u>. (Underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Notably, the Court had recognized the authority of the SDES and DES in the 2017 case of <i>Baculi v. Office of the President</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which the <em>ponencia</em> cites.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioner therein questioned the order of dismissal against him, claiming that it should have been issued by the President who should have personally exercised the power to remove him, not by the Acting DES for Legal Affairs. The Court dismissed this contention, ruling as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x <u>[I]t was of no moment to the validity and efficacy of the dismissal that only Acting Deputy Executive Secretary</u> for Legal Affairs Gaite had signed and issued the order of dismissal. In so doing, Acting Deputy Executive Secretary Gaite neither exceeded his authority, nor usurped the power of the President. Although the powers and functions of the Chief Executive have been expressly reposed by the Constitution in one person, the President of the Philippines, it would be unnatural to expect the President to personally exercise and discharge all such powers and functions. Somehow, the exercise and discharge of most of these powers and functions have been delegated to others, particularly to the members of the Cabinet, conformably to the doctrine of qualified political agency. <b>Accordingly, we have expressly recognized the extensive range of authority vested in the Executive Secretary or the Deputy Executive Secretary as an official who ordinarily acts for and in behalf of the President. As such, <u>the decisions or orders emanating from the Office of the Executive Secretary are attributable to the Executive Secretary even if they have been signed only by any of the Deputy Executive Secretaries</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> With respect to SDES Cardenas who, in so many words, the Court ruled in the 2015 PIDS case to have had no power to act by authority of the President on his own or in default of the ES, MO No. 17 dated September 7, 1998 specifically provides his duties and functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Among these is to "<u>[p]erform the duties of the Executive Secretary upon express designation and delegation during his absence or when the Secretary is unable to perform his duties owing to illness and other causes</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> These Presidential issuances show that no absolute or categorical rule can be made that the SDES has no power to act on his own or in default of the ES by authority of the President generally or specifically whether it be to exempt PIDS from the coverage of A.O. 402, or to approve the HMP pursuant to A.O. 402. </p><p> Therefore, I am concerned that it may be somewhat improvident for the Court to resolve the current case by distinguishing this case from the 2015 PIDS case on that account. This, especially considering that the current organizational setup of the OP still has a DES for Legal Affairs, General Administration, and Finance and Administration, with duties and responsibilities which they exercise on their own or in default of the ES by authority of the President. </p><p> To reiterate, the COA disallowed the subject amounts for violating COA Resolution No. 2005-001. Indeed, one of PIDS's arguments was that it was authorized by the OP, upon recommendation of the DOH and DBM, to establish its own HMP in lieu of that authorized in A.O. 402. Thus, according to PIDS, it had duly complied with the requirement in Section 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 1597 of securing approval from the OP of its HMP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> However, the COA made clear its position that the approval by the DOH, DBM, and the OP does not exempt PIDS from compliance with COA Resolution No. 2005-001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p>Correlatively, x x x, the approvals by the DOH, DBM and OP will not, in any manner, render the agreements valid since, in the first place, they were not in accordance with AO No. 402. Although it complied with Section 5 of PD No. 1597 which requires presidential approval on the grant of any allowance, honoraria and other benefits to government officials and employees, such approval nonetheless was not in harmony with the provision of AO No. 402, the enabling law that gave rise to said Agreements. The Agreements should have been in conformity with AO No. 402 and not have been over and beyond what was provided thereof. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, <b>the disallowance in this case was made by the COA not on the basis of the authority or the lack thereof of the SDES or the ES in approving PIDS's request for the establishment or continuation of its HMP</b>. In fact, the COA recognizes that PIDS was authorized by the President, through the letter from the ES. As stated in the COA's Comment: </p><blockquote> <p> Let it be stressed that the letter of Executive Secretary Eduardo R. Ermita, by authority of the President, dated July 23, 2007, approving the request of petitioner PIDS to continue the implementation of its Annual Medical Check-Up Program with private health insurance companies "is subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations." Thus, the approval by the President of PIDS' health care package with private health insurance companies carries with it the express reservation or condition that it should be subject to the usual accounting rules and regulations of the COA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> It is thus clear that the COA's concern was the extent of the President's approval,<em> i.e.,</em> that it is still "subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations." </p><p> To my mind, this is the issue upon which the case turns. In other words, does the OP approval, admitted by both parties, serve to excuse PIDS from complying with COA Resolution No. 2005-001? </p><p> In this regard, I agree with the <em>ponencia</em> that the tenor of the approval given by SDES Cardenas in 2000 and by ES Ermita in 2007 tends to show that PIDS was authorized to establish its HMP <em>in lieu</em> of the PHIC health program as provided in A.O. 402. Meaning, while the authority given to PIDS by ES Ermita provides that it is still "subject to the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations," this does not mean that the COA can use A.O. 402 in order to cite PIDS in violation of the authority granted to it — as this proves to be a circular argument. </p><p> An administrative order is an executive issuance; hence, it can be abrogated by the President as the issuing authority. When ES Ermita, by authority of the President, approved PIDS 's request for authority to continue with the implementation of their HMP <b><i><u>in lieu of that provided in A.O. 402</u></i></b>, the President, in effect, carved out an exception from A.O. 402 in favor of PIDS. Thus, the COA cannot hold PIDS liable under A.O. 402 precisely because the President, through the ES, already exempted PIDS from said administrative order. </p><p> On this note, I also agree with the following statements in the <em>ponencia</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> "In lieu" means instead or in the place of. It signifies that petitioner's annual medical checkup program functions as a substitute or an alternative to the annual medical health program provided under Administrative Order No. 402. </p> <p> Thus, respondent erred when it upheld Notice of Disallowance No. 11-001-(06-10) reasoning that petitioner's agreements with health insurance companies should have been limited to diagnostic medical procedures, such as physical examination, chest x-ray, complete blood count, urinalysis, stool examination and ECG, as provided under Administrative Order No. 402.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Likewise, I agree with the ruling in the <em>ponencia</em> that PIDS did not violate COA Resolution No. 2005-001, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Clearly, procuring health insurance from private health insurance companies, by itself, does not constitute disbursement of public funds. What Commission on Audit Resolution No. 2005-001 forbids is the procurement of another health insurance<em> in addition</em> to the health program provided by the government through PhilHealth. </p> <p> The annual medical checkup program being implemented by petitioner <u>is <b>not an additional</b> insurance. It <b>is an alternative</b> to that provided by PhilHealth</u>. <u>PhilHealth</u>, in its July 13, 2007 letter, <u>informed petitioner that it has "not yet included the annual medical check-up benefit in the benefit packages being developed by [it]</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> All things considered, I submit that the resolution of the case turned only upon this issue, making it unnecessary to rely upon qualified political agency as the <i>ratio decidendi</i> for the ultimate resolution of the case. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> This caption was used by Chief Justice Enrique Fernando in <i>Tañada v.
