				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><i>Grounded on equity, the derivative suit has proven to be an effective tool for the protection of minority shareholders. Such actions have for their object the vindication of a corporate injury, even though they are not brought by the corporation, but by its stockholders. That said, derivative suits remain an exception. As a general rule, corporate litigation must be commenced by the corporation itself, with the imprimatur of the board of directors, which, pursuant to the law, wields the power to sue. Therefore, since the derivative suit is a remedy of last resort, it must be shown that the board, to the detriment of the corporation and without a valid business consideration, refuses to remedy a corporate wrong. A derivative suit may only be instituted after such an omission. Simply put, derivative suits take a back seat to board-sanctioned litigation whenever the corporation is willing and able to sue in its own name.</i> <p> On appeal are the September 26, 2013 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the January 10, 2014 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

They essentially alleged that Angelita, in connivance with Teresita P. Apin (Teresita), Maribel Amaro (Maribel), and certain local officials of Legazpi City, introduced unauthorized improvements on corporate property.

She narrated that sometime in the 1960s, Emmanuel and Corazon immigrated to the United States, leaving the management of ARDC's properties to her.

After she failed to satisfy the unreasonable demand, Emmanuel, through two letters sent by counsel, allegedly accused her of introducing improvements on ARDC's property and allowing Teresita to operate a restaurant business thereon, without the necessary authorization from the corporation's Board of Directors.

Tan, <i>et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the Court explained when such actions lie,<em> viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> Suits by stockholders or members of a corporation based on wrongful or fraudulent acts of directors or other persons may be classified into individual suits, class suits, and derivative suits. Where a stockholder or member is denied the right of inspection, his suit would be individual because the wrong is done to him personally and not to the other stockholders or the corporation. Where the wrong is done to a group of stockholders, as where preferred stockholders' rights are violated, a class or representative suit will be proper for the protection of all stockholders belonging to the same group. <b><u>But where the acts complained of constitute a wrong to the corporation itself, the cause of action belongs to the corporation and not to the individual stockholder or member</u></b>. Although in most every case of wrong to the corporation, each stockholder is necessarily affected because the value of his interest therein would be impaired, this fact of itself is not sufficient to give him an individual cause of action since the corporation is a person distinct and separate from him, and can and should itself sue the wrongdoer. Otherwise, not only would the theory of separate entity be violated, but there would be multiplicity of suits as well as a violation of the priority rights of creditors. Furthermore, there is the difficulty of determining the amount of damages that should be paid to each individual stockholder. </p> <p> However, in cases of mismanagement <b><u>where the wrongful acts are committed by the directors or trustees themselves, a stockholder or member may find that he has no redress because the former are vested by law with the right to decide whether or not the corporation should sue, and they will never be willing to sue themselves</u></b>. The corporation would thus be helpless to seek remedy. Because of the frequent occurrence of such a situation, the common law gradually recognized the right of a stockholder to sue on behalf of a corporation in what eventually became known as a "derivative suit." <b><u>It has been proven to be an effective remedy of the minority against the abuses of management</u></b>. Thus, an individual stockholder is permitted to institute a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation wherein he holds stock in order to protect or vindicate corporate rights, whenever officials of the corporation refuse to sue or are the ones to be sued or hold the control of the corporation. In such actions, the suing stockholder is regarded as the nominal party, with the corporation as the party in interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the CA held that since the cause of action belongs to ARDC, the properties in question being titled in its name, the case instituted by Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> was derivative in nature.

A minority stockholder then instituted a petition to annul the subject mortgage deeds and the consequent foreclosure sales. The complaint alleged that the suing minority stockholder had been excluded from corporate affairs and that attempts between him and the other stockholders to compromise the case had failed.

The Court held that the suit was correctly classified as derivative in nature since the relator-stockholders had clearly alleged injury to the corporation. The fact that the plaintiffs alleged damage to themselves in their personal capacities on top of the damage done to the corporation merely gave rise to an additional cause of action, but it did not disqualify them from filing a derivative suit. </p><p> In <i>San Miguel Corporation v.

SMC tried to repurchase shares through its wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Neptunia Corporation Limited (Neptunia). However, the shares had been sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) on the ground that they were owned by one of the cronies of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Later, SMC's Board of Directors passed a resolution assuming Neptunia's liability for the purchase of the subject shares. The board opined that there was nothing illegal about the assumption of liability since Neptunia was wholly-owned by SMC. Subsequently, Eduardo de los Angeles (De los Angeles), director and minority stockholder of SMC, brought a derivative suit challenging the board resolution as constituting an improper use of corporate funds. When the case reached the Court, it was held that De los Angeles had properly resorted to a derivative suit. It was of no moment that he owned only 20 SMC shares or that he was elected to the board of directors by the PCGG. Since the case concerned the validity of the assumption by SMC of the indebtedness of Neptunia, a cause of action that indeed belonged to the former corporation, the Court held that De los Angeles could maintain the suit on behalf of SMC. </p><p> Despite derivative suits being grounded on equity, they cannot prosper in the absence of any or some of the requisites enumerated in the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> <em>viz</em>.: </p><p align="center"> <b>Rule 8 <br> DERIVATIVE SUITS</b> </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. <i>Derivative action</i>. - A stockholder or member may bring an action in the name of a corporation or association, as the case may be, provided, that: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">He was a stockholder or member at the time the acts or transactions subject of the action occurred and the time the action was filed;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">He exerted all reasonable efforts, and alleges the same with particularity in the complaint, to exhaust all remedies available under the articles of incorporation, by-laws, laws or rules governing the corporation or partnership to obtain the relief he desires; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">No appraisal rights are available for the acts or acts complained of; and </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The suits is not a nuisance or harassment suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>The second requisite does not obtain in this case. </p> <p> <b>Before instituting a derivative suit, the relator-stockholder must exert all reasonable efforts to exhaust all remedies available under the articles of incorporation, the by-laws, and the laws or rules governing the corporation or partnership to obtain the relief he or she desires.</b> Such fact must then be alleged with particularity in the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> "The obvious intent behind the rule is to make the derivative suit the final recourse of the stockholder, after all other remedies to obtain the relief sought had failed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> </p><p> In their petition, Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> allege that they exerted all reasonable efforts to exhaust all remedies available to them.

For the minority, on the other hand, this may not be the case. There may be situations where a corporation is wronged, but the board of directors refuses to take remedial action. The board's refusal may be based on valid business considerations, such as that the costs of litigation exceed the potential judgment award. But <b>in situations where the board's decision is tantamount to breaching the trust reposed in it by the minority, equity necessitates that the aggrieved stockholders be given a remedy</b>.

On this point, the record is bereft of any showing that ARDC's stockholders ever met to elect its governing board.

While Emmanuel, Corazon, and Angelita came together for a special stockholders' meeting on August 11, 2006, no election was held then. As mentioned earlier, Angelita walked out before the meeting started, and Emmanuel and Corazon were only able to pass a stockholders' resolution purportedly authorizing the institution of the instant case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> However, as amply discussed above, a corporation's power to sue is lodged in its board of directors. Hence, the resolution, not emanating from the board, was inefficacious. </p> <p> The failure of ARDC's majority stockholders to elect a board of directors must be taken against them. To be sure, <b>there was nothing preventing Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> from holding a meeting for the purpose of electing a board, even in Angelita's absence or over her objection</b>. It is admitted that the plaintiffs<em> a quo</em> hold a majority of ARDC's capital stock, by virtue of which they could have constituted a board to exercise the corporation's powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> If they had done so, the instant case could have been instituted by ARDC itself. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The role of the board of directors is impressed with such importance that corporate business cannot properly be conducted without it</i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Being necessary to the legitimate operation of business, the board of directors is an organ that is indispensable to the corporate vehicle. If this case were allowed to prosper as a derivative suit, the non-election of boards of directors would be incentivized, and the stability brought by "centralized management"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> eroded. <b>Majority shareholders cannot be allowed to bypass the formation of a board and directly conduct corporate business themselves. The Court cannot stress enough that the law mandates corporations to exercise their powers through their governing boards. </b>Hence, if a person<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> or group of persons truly desires to conduct business through the corporate medium, then he, she, or they, as a matter of law, must form a board of directors. To allow Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> to forego the election of directors, and directly commence and prosecute this case would not only downplay the key role of the board in corporate affairs, but also undermine the theory of separate juridical personality. </p><p> It is axiomatic that a corporation is an entity with a legal personality separate and distinct from the people comprising it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Accordingly, a wrong done to a corporation does not vest in its shareholders a cause of action against the wrongdoer. Since the corporation is the real party in interest, it must seek redress itself. As stated above, a case instituted by the stockholders would be subject to dismissal on the ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> </p><p> Here, because ARDC is the victim of the act complained of, the cause of action does not lie with Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> The corporation should have filed the case itself through its board of directors. However, this could not be done since those responsible for the institution of this case never bothered to elect a governing body to wield ARDC's powers and to manage its affairs. Their omission cannot be without consequence. Verily, <strong>by virtue of their admitted controlling interest in ARDC, Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> could have come together and formed a board of directors consisting of all five of the corporation's stockholders</strong>. Even without Angelita's participation, such a board would have been able to validly conduct business<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> and, accordingly, could have sanctioned the filing of the complaint before the Legazpi City RTC. The aggrieved stockholders cannot now come before the Court, claiming that their remedy is a derivative suit. <strong>Their failure to elect a board ultimately resulted in their failure to exhaust all legal remedies to obtain the relief they desired</strong>. Since this case could have been brought by ARDC, through its board, its stockholders cannot maintain the suit themselves, purporting to sue in a derivative capacity.<strong> Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> should not be allowed to use a derivative suit to shortcut the law.</strong> </p><p> Neither can Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> take refuge in their assertion that ARDC is a close family corporation. They claim that the stockholders of a close corporation may take part in the active management of corporate affairs. Hence, they, as ARDC's stockholders, are legally invested with the power to sue for the corporation. </p><p> As correctly claimed, under Section 97 of the Corporation Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> a close corporation may task its stockholders with the management of business, essentially designating them as directors. However, the law is clear that a close corporation must do so through a provision to that effect contained in its articles of incorporation. Nowhere in ARDC's Articles of incorporation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> can such a provision be found. <strong>There is nothing that expressly or impliedly allows Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> and Angelita, or any of them, to manage the corporation</strong>. Hence, the merger of stock ownership and active management that Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> rely on cannot be applied to ARDC. </p><p> Further, assuming<em> arguendo</em> that ARDC is a close family corporation, the same cannot be considered a justification for noncompliance with the requirements for the filing of a derivative suit. In<em> Ang v. Sps. Ang</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> the Court declared: </p><blockquote> <p> The fact that [SMBI] is a family corporation does not exempt private respondent Juanito Ang from complying with the Interim Rules.

Since it is settled that she introduced improvements on ARDC's property without its consent, it follows that the complaint was not baseless at all. However, because the case was not brought by the corporation, but by its stockholders, its dismissal was properly decreed by the trial court. </p><p> The fact that Emmanuel, <i>et al.</i> brought the case without the consent of the corporation cannot be equivalent to malice. Surely, they could have elected a board of directors to run ARDC's affairs, but their failure to do so, coupled with the filing of the complaint before the RTC, should not make them liable for moral damages. After all, the fact that a case is dismissed does not <em>per se</em> make that case one of malicious prosecution and subject the plaintiff to the payment of moral damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Since it is not a sound public policy to place a premium on the right to litigate, no damages can be charged on those who exercise such precious right in good faith, even if done erroneously.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> </p><p> Neither does the Court see any cogent reason to award attorney's fees in favor of Angelita. Certainly, she only has herself to blame for the filing of the case before the RTC. If she did not introduce improvements on ARDC's property, Emmanuel <i>et al.</i> would have no reason to institute an action against her. Since she treated corporate property as if it was her own, she should have reasonably expected retaliatory action from the other shareholders. Hence, the CA was correct to delete the award of attorney's fees. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the September 26, 2013 Decision and January 10, 2014 Resolution rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
