The prosecution alleged that at around six (6) o'clock in the morning of May 13, 2015, the members of the Tingloy Police Station proceeded to the residence of petitioner located at Barangay Sto. Tomas, Tingloy, Batangas to implement Search Warrant No. 15-20<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated May 7, 2015 (search warrant) issued by the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City, Branch 3 for an alleged violation of RA 9165.

After placing petitioner under arrest, the police officers marked, inventoried, and photographed the seized items in the presence of petitioner, Barangay Chairman Aileen Mendoza (Brgy. Chairman Mendoza), media representative Benedicto Griño (Griño), and Department of Justice (DOJ) representative Judith Buhay (Buhay). Afterwards, they brought petitioner and the seized items to the police station to prepare the request for laboratory examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Subsequently, PO1 Togonon delivered the letter-request and the two (2) plastic sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i> to the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory Office, where, after examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the contents thereof yielded positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>For his part, petitioner interposed the defense of denial, claiming that at around three (3) o'clock in the morning of May 13, 2015, some police officers suddenly barged into his house and began searching its premises against his consent. After the search, they found illegal drugs at the second floor of his house and consequently, brought him to the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In a Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated July 14, 2017, the RTC found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to thirteen (13) years and one (1) day, as maximum, and to pay a fine in the amount of P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It held that as opposed to petitioner's bare denials, the prosecution adduced sufficient proof to show that all the elements of the crime were present, and that the chain of custody over the seized dangerous drugs remained unbroken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Aggrieved, petitioner appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to the CA.<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated June 29, 2018, the CA affirmed petitioner's conviction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> ruling that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were properly preserved from the time they were recovered in petitioner's house until they were handed over to Police Senior Inspector Herminia Carandang Llacuna (PSI Llacuna), Forensic Chemist, for laboratory examination, who, in turn, delivered the same to Evidence Custodian Joel Barcelona (EC Barcelona) for safekeeping.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Moreover, it found the minor inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses to be trivial matters that bear little significance to the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Undaunted, petitioner sought reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated September 18, 2018; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>In every prosecution of the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165, the following elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (<i>a</i>) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (<i>b</i>) such possession was not authorized by law; and (<i>c</i>) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Here, the courts <i>a quo</i> correctly ruled that the prosecution was able to establish with moral certainty all the foregoing elements, considering that: (<i>a</i>) by virtue of a valid search warrant, the police officers recovered, among others, two (2) plastic sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i> from petitioner's house; (<i>b</i>) petitioner failed to prove that his possession of the seized dangerous drugs was authorized by law; and (<i>c</i>) petitioner freely and consciously possessed the same because he hid them inside a <i>Katialis</i> ointment container.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In this regard, it should be noted that the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Hence, since there is no indication that the said courts overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, the Court finds no reason to deviate from their factual findings.<br><br>Further, the Court notes that the police officers sufficiently complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Notably, to establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, a representative from the media <u><i>AND</i></u> the DOJ, and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <u><i>OR</i></u> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Records show that after petitioner was arrested, the police officers immediately took custody of the seized items. They also conducted the requisite marking, inventory, and photography thereof in the presence of an elected public official, <i>i.e.</i>, Brgy. Chairman Mendoza; a media representative, <i>i.e.</i>, Griño; and a DOJ representative, <i>i.e.</i>, Buhay, right at the place where petitioner was arrested.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Subsequently, PO1 Togonon delivered the seized items to PSI Llacuna for laboratory examination, who, in turn, brought the same to EC Barcelona for safekeeping. In light of the foregoing, the Court holds that the chain of custody over the seized dangerous drugs remained unbroken, and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> have been properly preserved. Perforce, petitioner's conviction must stand.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>, the Decision dated June 29, 2018 and the Resolution dated September 18, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody.
