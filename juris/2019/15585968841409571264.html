Jardeleza, ruled that courts may deviate from the basic formula provided by administrative agencies if it finds, in its discretion, that other factors must be taken into account in the determination of just compensation. Deviation, however, must be grounded on a reasoned explanation based on the evidence on record. Absent this, the deviation will be considered as grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><p> For this Court's resolution is a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> assailing the Court of Appeals January 20, 2011 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and August 8, 2012 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in CA-G.R.

On the other hand, the valuation of the petitioners is likewise cumbersomely high for the government and the farmer-beneficiaries considering that the valuation of P300,000.00 per hectare they initially asked in 1998 were based only on assumptions of facts unsupported by credible evidence. This offer of P300,000.00 was reiterated by Mr. Gustilo during the hearing and clearly, this offer is based on his own declarations but this was not adequately substantiated and therefore inconclusive. Thus, the Court in the exercise of its judicial prerogatives, must consider the needs of both parties and should be guided by several factors in order to arrive at a just compensation which is fair, reasonable and acceptable to the parties. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p><i>The Supreme Court has ruled that (sic) in several cases that the determination of just compensation is a function addressed to the Courts</i>. It may not be usurped by any other branch or official of the government. The Courts are unanimous in decrying mathematical formulas or method "where even a grade school pupil could substitute for a judge for fixing just compensation. These methods are considered impermissible encroachments on judicial prerogatives. They tend to render the court inutile in a matter which under the [Constitution is reserved to the courts for final determination". Thus, pure mathematical approaches to valuation will not be tolerated by the courts, whose hands remain free and untied in arriving at just compensation. </p> <p> <i>Thus, in determining just compensation, the Court will take into consideration the factors, like the price set by the plaintiffs when they first offered the subject land for voluntary acquisition (P300,000.00 per hectare; Date of Offer - January 30, 1995) and those provided under Section 17 of R.A. 6657, to wit: a) the cost of acquisition of the land; b) the current value of like properties; c) the sworn valuation by the owner; d) the tax declarations and assessments; e) the assessments made by government assessors; f) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farm workers and by the government to the property; and g) the non-payment of taxes or loans secure from any government financing institution on the said land.</i> </p> <p> The petitioners herein presented the four (4) Tax Declarations for 1996 of the subject lots wherein the assessor fixed the market value per hectare of the bamboo land at P45,200.00 (total area - 0.5000 Has.); for rice land irrigated at P60,830.00 (total area - 1.5716 hectares); for coconut land at P45,000.00 (total area - 0.2000 hectares); and for sugar land at P122,000.00 (total area - 8.2318 hectares) or a total market value of P1,131,479.60. </p> <p> Although the market value appearing in the tax declaration is usually lower than the actual value of the property, the court will consider the said amount since no evidence was presented by the plaintiffs to prove a higher amount. </p> <p> In evaluating the subject lot in the case at bar, the Court will take into account the amount of P31,789.80 per hectare of bamboo land consisting of 0.4855 hectares; P59,871.97 per hectare of rice unirrigated consisting of 8.9920 hectare[s]; and P59,502.19 per hectare of rice unirrigated consisting of 3.1202 hectares, <em>which was arrived at using the mathematical formula provided under DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 and the market value of the property as shown in the tax declarations</em> which are as follows: for bamboo land consisting of 0.5000 hectares, the market value is P22,600.00; for coconut land consisting of 0.2000 hectares, the market value is P9,000.00; for rice irrigated consisting of 1.5716 hectares, the market value is P95,600.00 per hectare; and for sugar land consisting of 8.2318 hectares, the market value is P1,004,279.60 or a total market value of P1,131,479.60. <em>The average of these amounts will be considered the just compensation of the subject lot. Such method of valuation is intended to take into account all the factors previously discussed.</em> Therefore, the average of these two figures will result in the following valuation per hectare: </p> <blockquote> <table width="80%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="24%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="22%">Per Hectare</td> <td width="27%">Area Actually Taken </td> <td width="27%">Value</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bambooland</td> <td>P38,494.50</td> <td>0.4855 Has.</td> <td>P18,689.08</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rice unirrigated</td> <td>P90,935.96</td> <td>8.9920 Has.</td> <td>817,696.15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td> Rice unirrigated</td> <td>P60,166.10</td> <td><u>3.1202 Has.</u></td> <td><u>187,730.26</u></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>[12.5977] has.</td> <td>P1,024,118.49</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>From the foregoing computations, this Court finds and so hold (<i>sic</i>) that the just compensation or land value of the subject lot located at Brgy. Maquina, Dumangas, Iloilo covered by TCT Nos. T-62209, T-622010, T-62212 and T-51376 and registered in the name of Lucy Grace Franco married to Jose Mandoriao, Jr. and Elma Gloria Franco is P1,024,115.40 for the 12.5977 hectares actually taken by the government and transferred in favor of the qualified farmer-beneficiaries. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p>The concept of just compensation embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also the payment of the land within a reasonable time from its taking. Without prompt payment, compensation cannot be considered "just" for the property owner is made to suffer the consequence of being immediately deprived of his land while being made to wait for a decade or more before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Land Bank filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but it was denied by the Special Agrarian Court in a November 14, 2007 Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p>Land Bank filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, arguing that the Special Agrarian Court's determination of just compensation was inconsistent with Department of Agrarian Reform Administrative Order No. 5, series of 1998 (Administrative Order No. 5).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> In its January 20, 2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court of Appeals, citing <i>Heirs of Lorenzo and Carmen Vidad v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> affirmed the ruling of the Special Agrarian Court and held that the determination of just compensation is judicial in nature: </p><blockquote> <p> Settled is the principle that the determination of just compensation is judicial in nature. Hence, contrary to petitioner's assertion, the court a quo may properly determine for itself the amount of just compensation to be awarded to private respondents. . . . The transaction involved the taking of the property of private respondents under R.A. 6657 which was an exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. As such, <i>the valuation of property or determination of just compensation is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies. Thus, even though there might have been an acceptance by the landowner of the valuation of the DAR, this acceptance does not bar resort to the courts for the final determination of just compensation</i>. </p> <blockquote> <p> "R.A. 6657 does not make DAR's valuation absolutely binding as the amount payable by petitioner. A reading of Section 18 of R.A. 6657 shows that the courts, and not the DAR, make the final determination of just compensation. It is well-settled that the DAR's land valuation is only preliminary and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party. The courts will still have the right to review with finality the determination in the exercise of what is admittedly a judicial function." </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, to sustain petitioner's position that the court a quo cannot re-evaluate the DAR's valuation, would modify the Special Agrarian Court's function to determine just compensation to an appellate one, instead of the original and exclusive jurisdiction vested upon it by R.A. 6657. </p> <p> <i>Admittedly, certain factors have to be considered in the determination of just compensation. As opposed to petitioner's claim, however, it appeared that the court a quo considered these factors when it awarded the sum of P1,024,115.49 to private respondents as compensation for their property taken under the CARP. Aside from the evidence submitted by petitioner, the court a quo likewise gave due consideration to private respondents' evidence, particularly as to the market value of the subject parcels of land. In fact, the court a quo utilized the same values as determined by DAR using the mathematical formula provided under DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 which embodied the criteria laid down in Section 17 of R.A. 6657</i>. Thus, it cannot be said that the court a quo disregarded the rules and principles established by law and jurisprudence on the fixing of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court of Appeals, however, modified the Special Agrarian Court Decision by deleting the imposition of the 12% legal interest on the outstanding amount. In doing so, it explained that the delay in the delivery of payment has not been established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> Land Bank filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration, but it was denied by the Court of Appeals in its August 8, 2012 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Hence, this Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> was filed. </p><p> Petitioner argues that in determining just compensation, the Special Agrarian Court expanded the basic general formula in Administrative Order No. 5 by taking the average between its valuation and the market value of the properties based on its respective tax declarations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> For reference, the basic general formula is: </p><blockquote> <p> LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)</p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="6%">Where:</td> <td width="5%">LV</td> <td width="4%">=</td> <td width="85%">Land Value </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>CNI</td> <td>=</td> <td>Capitalized Net Income </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>CS</td> <td>=</td> <td>Comparable Sales</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>MV</td> <td>=</td> <td>Market Value per Tax Declaration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Petitioner contends that the Special Agrarian Court expanded the formula to LV = [(CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)] + 1996 tax declaration) / 2 x area, which it claims was contrary to Administrative Order No. 5.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It argues that in a long line of cases, this Court "has demonstrated judicial fealty to the applicable formula and guidelines which [the Department of Agrarian Reform] issued through several administrative orders."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It cites <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

It submits that considering that the properties acquired were below 24 hectares and were voluntarily offered for sale, the landowner, instead of receiving 35% in cash and 65% in agrarian reform bonds, should receive 40% in cash and 60% in agrarian reform bonds as just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p><p> Respondents, on the other hand, counter that the Special Agrarian Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation.

The State shall, by law, <i>undertake an agrarian reform program founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other farmworkers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof</i>. To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental, or equity considerations, and <i>subject to the payment of just compensation</i>. In determining retention limits, the State shall respect the right of small landowners. <i>The State shall further provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Several laws were enacted to ensure that the State's policy toward agrarian reform is properly carried out. These laws are outlined in A<i>ssociation of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> R.A. No. 3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, had already been enacted by the Congress of the Philippines on August 8, 1963, in line with the above-stated principles. This was substantially superseded almost a decade later by P.D. No. 27, which was promulgated on October 21, 1972, along with martial law, to provide for the compulsory acquisition of private lands for distribution among tenant-farmers and to specify maximum retention limits for landowners. </p> <p> The people power revolution of 1986 did not change and indeed even energized the thrust for agrarian reform. Thus, on July 17, 1987, President Corazon C. Aquino issued E.O. No. 228, declaring full land ownership in favor of the beneficiaries of P.D. No. 27 and providing for the valuation of still unvalued lands covered by the decree as well as the manner of their payment. This was followed on July 22, 1987 by Presidential Proclamation No. 131, instituting a comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP), and E.O. No. 229, providing the mechanics for its implementation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In 1988, the Congress enacted the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, which further strengthened the State's policy toward agrarian reform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The law provided an exact definition of the phrase "agrarian reform," thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Agrarian Reform means the redistribution of lands, regardless of crops or fruits produced to farmers and regular farmworkers who are landless, irrespective of tenurial arrangement, to include the totality of factors and support services designed to lift the economic status of the beneficiaries and all other arrangements alternative to the physical redistribution of lands, such as production or profit-sharing, labor administration, and the distribution of shares of stocks, which will allow beneficiaries to receive a just share of the fruits of the lands they work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In light of these developments, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, or the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, vested in regional trial courts exclusive and original jurisdiction of civil actions and special proceedings under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the courts of agrarian relations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Section 56,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> in relation to Section 57<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, confers "special jurisdiction" on special agrarian courts. </p><p> Regional trial courts, sitting as special agrarian courts, have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, as well as the prosecution of all criminal offenses under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In contrast to the special agrarian courts, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board only has preliminary administrative determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> Just compensation is "the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The measure of the taking "is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The term "just" intensifies the term "compensation" to obtain a real, substantial, full, and ample equivalent for the property taken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The jurisdiction of the trial courts, sitting as special agrarian courts, is "not any less 'original' and 'exclusive'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> because the Department of Agrarian Reform passes upon the question of just compensation first.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> "[judicial proceedings are not a continuation of the administrative determination ... the law may provide that the decision of the [Department of Agrarian Reform] is final and unappealable.

This "original and exclusive" jurisdiction of the RTC would be undermined if the DAR would vest in administrative officials (sic) original jurisdiction in compensation cases and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions. Thus, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from Sec. 57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Sec. 57 and therefore would be void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> A statute's provisions should be read in its entirety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Section 57 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, on the exclusive and original jurisdiction of special agrarian courts, must be read with Section 16(f), which provides that: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 16.

In its exercise of original jurisdiction, the special agrarian court may deviate from the formulas if it can show that the value is not equivalent to the fair market value at the time of the taking. However, an allegation is not enough. The landowner must allege and prove why the formula provided by the Department of Agrarian Reform does not suffice. </p><p> Nonetheless, having original and exclusive jurisdiction does not mean that our courts should be removed from the realities that confront the entire government bureaucracy and, in so doing, become impervious to the guidelines issued by our administrative agencies. </p><p> In<i> Land Bank v. Palmares</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> this Court affirmed the validity of the basic formula developed by the Department of Agrarian Reform. There, the respondents voluntarily offered their 19.98-hectare agricultural land for sale to the government under the agrarian reform program. The Department of Agrarian Reform offered P440,355.92 as just compensation, which the respondents rejected. Thus, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board commenced summary proceedings to determine just compensation. It resolved to adopt the Land Bank's valuation, which prompted the respondents to file a petition to determine just compensation before the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, sitting as the Special Agrarian Court. </p><p> After the trial court had ordered a re-computation, Land Bank arrived at the amount of P503,148.97. With the respondents still rejecting the amount, the trial court made its own computation of just compensation by averaging the price of the land per hectare, as computed based on the Department of Agrarian Reform guidelines and the market value of the land per hectare as shown in the 1997 tax declaration covering the property. It arrived at the amount of P669,962.53, which would later be upheld by the Court of Appeals. </p><p> However, this Court reversed the judgments, finding that the trial court's computation was against the mandate of the law. It first discussed Section 17 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, which enumerated the factors for determining just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> It then declared that the Department of Agrarian Reform, in accordance with its rule-making power, translated these factors into a basic formula: </p><blockquote> <p> LV = (CNI x 0.6) + (CS x 0.3) + (MV x 0.1)</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="6%">Where:</td> <td width="5%">LV</td> <td width="4%">=</td> <td width="85%">Land Value </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>CNI</td> <td>=</td> <td>Capitalized Net Income </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>CS</td> <td>=</td> <td>Comparable Sales</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>MV</td> <td>=</td> <td>Market Value per Tax Declaration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Still in<em> Palmares</em>, this Court found that the Land Bank had already factored in the property's market value as appearing in the 1995 tax declaration in computing the value of just compensation. By averaging the price of the land, as computed based on the Department guidelines, and the land's market value as appearing in the 1997 tax declaration, the special agrarian court did a "double take up" of the market value per tax declaration of the property. Such double take up, this Court held, destroyed the affordability of the land to the farmer-beneficiaries. In the end, the case was ordered remanded to the trial court for a re-computation of the just compensation, per Section 17 and the Department of Agrarian Reform's applicable administrative orders. </p><p> The validity of the Department of Agrarian Reform's basic formula in determining just compensation was affirmed in <em>Land Bank v. Hababag, Sr</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> There, this Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' computation for adhering to the basic formula. It set aside the special agrarian court's computation for having been arrived at using the income productivity approach, which it found to be "off-tangent with the governmental purpose behind the acquisition of agricultural lands."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> This Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> [C]ase law states that agricultural lands are not acquired for investment purposes but for redistribution to landless farmers in order to lift their economic status by enabling them to own directly or collectively the lands they till or to receive a just share of the fruits thereof. In this regard, farmer-beneficiaries are not given those lands so they can live there but so that they can till them. Since they generally live on a hand-to-mouth existence, their source of repaying the just compensation is but derived out of their income from their cultivation of the land. Hence, in order to be just, the compensation for the land must be what the farmer-beneficiaries can reasonably afford to pay based on what the land can produce. It would therefore be highly inequitable that in the 30-year allowable period to pay the annual amortizations for the lands, farmer-beneficiaries would be required to pay for the same income they expect to earn therefrom on top of the computed market value of the landholdings. Such could not have been the intent of the State's agrarian reform program. In fine, the Court cannot sustain the RTC's application of the Income Productivity Approach used as one of its bases in arriving at its decreed valuation. Not only is the same aversive to the jurisprudential concept of "market value," but it also deviates from the factors laid down in Section 17 of RA 6657 and thus, remains legally baseless and unfounded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the Special Agrarian Court found that a slight deviation was in order. It held that there were other factors present that must also be taken into account, deeming petitioner's valuation to be "unrealistically low": </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he Court finds the total valuation by the LBP and the DAR in the amount of P739,461.43 to be unrealistically low and therefore is not the just compensation of the subject lot. On the other hand, the valuation of the petitioners is likewise cumbersomely high for the government and the farmer-beneficiaries considering that the valuation of P300,000.00 per hectare they initially asked in 1998 were based only on assumptions of facts unsupported by credible evidence. This offer of P300,000.00 was reiterated by Mr. Gustilo during the hearing and clearly, this offer is based on his own declarations but this was not adequately substantiated and therefore inconclusive. Thus, the Court in the exercise of its judicial prerogatives, must consider the needs of both parties and should be guided by several factors in order to arrive at a just compensation which is fair, reasonable and acceptable to the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The Special Agrarian Court proceeded to compute just compensation according to the factors in Administrative Order No. 5 and the market value of the property as shown in the tax declarations: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Thus, in determining just compensation, the Court will take into consideration the factors, like the price set by the plaintiffs when they first offered the subject land for voluntary acquisition (P300,000.00 per hectare; Date of Offer - January 30, 1995) and those provided under Section 17 of R.A. 6657, to wit: a) the cost of acquisition of the land; b) the current value of like properties; c) the sworn valuation by the owner; d) the tax declarations and assessments; e) the assessments made by government assessors; f) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farm workers and by the government to the property; and g) the non-payment of taxes or loans secure from any government financing institution on the said land.</i> </p> <p> The petitioners herein presented the four (4) Tax Declarations for 1996 of the subject lots wherein the assessor fixed the market value per hectare of the bamboo land at P45,200.00 (total area - 0.5000 Has.); for rice land irrigated at P60,830.00 (total area- 1.5716 hectares); for coconut land at P45,000.00 (total area - 0.2000 hectares); and for sugar land at P122,000.00 (total area - 8.2318 hectares) or a total market value of P1,131,479.60.</p> <p> Although the market value appearing in the tax declaration is usually lower than the actual value of the property, the court will consider the said amount since no evidence was presented by the plaintiffs to prove a higher amount. </p> <p> In evaluating the subject lot in the case at bar, the Court will take into account the amount of P31,789.80 per hectare of bamboo land consisting of 0.4855 hectares; P59,871.97 per hectare of rice unirrigated consisting of 8.9920 hectare[s]; and P59,502.19 per hectare of rice unirrigated consisting of 3.1202 hectares, <i>which was arrived at using the mathematical formula provided under DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 and the market value of the property as shown in the tax declarations</i> which are as follows: for bamboo land consisting of 0.5000 hectares, the market value is P22,600.00; for coconut land consisting of 0.2000 hectares, the market value is P9,000.00; for rice irrigated consisting of 1.5716 hectares, the market value is P95,600.00 per hectare; and for sugar land consisting of 8.2318 hectares, the market value is P1,004,279.60 or a total market value of P1,131,479.60. <i>The average of these amounts will be considered the just compensation of the subject lot.

The State shall provide incentives to landowners to invest the proceeds of the agrarian reform program to promote industrialization, employment creation, and privatization of public sector enterprises. Financial instruments used as payment for their lands shall be honored as equity in enterprises of their choice. </p> </blockquote> <p> Aside from cash payment, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law provides for three (3) more modes of payment. Section 19 must be interpreted to mean that while the additional five percent (5%) cash payment is an incentive to owners-sellers to expedite the agrarian reform program, the incentive given to these land owners should not be to the detriment of the government. </p><p> If, as respondents have argued, the additional five percent (5%) is indeed to be paid on top of the awarded just compensation for the property, then the law would not have put "cash" before "payment" in Section 19, in turn modifying the kind of payment to be given to the owners-sellers. </p><p> The landowner shall receive 35% of the just compensation in cash, while the remaining 65% shall be paid in bonds if the aggregate area acquired by the Department of Agrarian Reform is below 24 hectares. However, if the landowner voluntarily offers their land to the Department of Agrarian Reform, as in this case, the landowner shall be entitled to an additional five percent (5%) only on the cash portion. Therefore, instead of receiving only 35% in cash, the landowner shall now receive 40% in cash and 60% in bonds. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.

To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to the priorities and retention limits set forth in this Act, having taken into account ecological, developmental, and equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation. The State shall respect the right of small landowners, and shall provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing. </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> The State shall apply the principles of agrarian reform, or stewardship, whenever applicable, in accordance with law, in the disposition or utilization of other natural resources, including lands of the public domain, under lease or concession, suitable to agriculture, subject to prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers and the rights of indigenous communities to their ancestral lands. </p> <p> The State may resettle landless farmers and farmworkers in its own agricultural estates, which shall be distributed to them in the manner provided by law. </p> <p> By means of appropriate incentives, the State shall encourage the formation and maintenance of economic-size family farms to be constituted by individual beneficiaries and small landowners.</p> <p> . . . </p> <p> The State shall be guided by the principles that land has a social function and land ownership has a social responsibility. Owners of agricultural lands have the obligation to cultivate directly or through labor administration the lands they own and thereby make the land productive. </p> <p> The State shall provide incentives to landowners to invest the proceeds of the agrarian reform program to promote industrialization, employment and privatization of public sector enterprises.
