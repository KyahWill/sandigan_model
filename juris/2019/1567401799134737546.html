Congson ("PO2 Julius") and PO3&nbsp; Socobos ("PO3&nbsp; Socobos") were at the office of the Anti-Illegal Drugs, Special Operation Task Group ("SAID-SOTG"), Valenzuela City Police Station when their regular confidential informant ("RCI") arrived and informed them about the illegal drug activities of a certain alias "Boyet" in Manggahan Street, Karuhatan, Valenzuela. Boyet was later identified as Jimmy.<br><br>Upon informing their Unit Chief, PCI Ruba, about the information, they planned the buy-bust operation. PO2 Julius, duly coordinated with Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency ("PDEA") and prepared a Coordination Form&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; Pre-Operation Report. PO2 Julius&nbsp; was&nbsp; then assigned as the poseur-buyer since he was just transferred from another battalion, making his identity more unknown to the target.<br><br>When the team arrived at the place of Jimmy, he was identified by the RCI. While at the gate of the house of Jimmy, the RCI proceeded to call for Jimmy. Jimmy answered the call and PO2 Julius was told by the RCI that he was the target.<br><br>The&nbsp; RCI then [told]&nbsp; Jimmy&nbsp; that the&nbsp; poseur-buyer, PO2 Julius, would like to buy shabu worth Php 200.00. He used two (2) one hundred (100) peso bills, duly marked with PO2 Julius' initials. After giving the marked&nbsp; money&nbsp; to Jimmy, the&nbsp; latter placed the&nbsp; said money in&nbsp; his left pocket. Thereafter, Jimmy took out a black coin purse from his right side pocket and pulled out one (1) plastic sachet containing shabu, which was handed over to PO2 Julius.<br><br>After&nbsp; receiving&nbsp; the&nbsp; plastic&nbsp; sachet,&nbsp; PO2 Julius&nbsp; made&nbsp; the&nbsp; pre­-arranged signal for arrest by lifting his cap and held the hand of Jimmy. The other operatives&nbsp; later handcuffed Jimmy. PO2 Julius proceeded to frisk Jimmy and was able to recover from the latter's&nbsp; right pocket the black coin purse, containing another plastic sachet of suspected shabu and two (2) aluminum foil strips. PO2 Julius also recovered from Jimmy the marked money.<br><br>As people around the closely built houses were starting to gather and cause a commotion, the buy[-]bust team was instructed by their lead operative to continue the inventory of the confiscated items at PCP-9. PO2 Julius testified that he had the sachet of shabu subject of sale in his right pocket&nbsp; while he was holding the black coin purse containing the other sachet of suspected shabu.<br><br>In the police station, inventory was conducted in the presence of Kagawad Rommel Mercado ("Kagawad Rommel"). The&nbsp; Department of Justice ("DOJ") Representative and Media Representative were also called to witness the inventory, but their numbers were busy. PO2 Julius duly marked the sachet of suspected shabu from his pocket as JC-1, the sachet of suspected shabu he recovered from the black coin purse as JC-2, the aluminum foils as JC-3 and JCV-5 and the coin purse itself as JC-4. PO2 Julius put all the evidence in a brown envelope and sealed it. Subsequently, PO2 Julius turned over the pieces of evidence to the investigator-on-case, [who], in turn, prepared the other pieces of evidence.<br><br>Meanwhile, PO3 Fortunato Candido ("PO3 Fortunato") prepared the following documents: Memorandum Request for the Conduct of Inventory, Request for Examination, Philippine National Police ("PNP") Arrest and Booking Sheet and the mug shot of Jimmy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><i>Version of the Defense</i><br><br>On the other hand, the defense's version, as summarized by the CA, is as follows:<br><blockquote>Jimmy&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; allegations against&nbsp; him.&nbsp; He testified&nbsp; that on March 4, 2016, he was walking towards the pharmacy to buy Salbutamol since his son had an asthma attack. Jimmy noticed that an Innova car was following him. Suddenly, two (2) men alighted and slammed him to the wall. When Jimmy asked them if they were police officers, one of the men took out a gun and pointed the same at his stomach. Jimmy was brought inside the car and [the policemen] started to question him about a certain Sugar.&nbsp; Jimmy&nbsp; replied that&nbsp; he [does]&nbsp; not&nbsp; know [Sugar]&nbsp; because many people eat at his "lugawan".<br><br>One of the officers demanded Php 10,000.00 if he could not point to them a certain Sugar. Jimmy was brought to Total Gasoline Station in front of SM Valenzuela and boarded in another vehicle.<br><br>Jimmy only had Php 170.00 in his pocket when he was arrested. He would use the said amount to buy Salbutamol. The sachets of shabu recovered from Jimmy were not his. Jimmy saw the said sachets for the first time when he was brought to Block 9.<br><br>On the other hand, Rosalinda Lague ("Rosalinda")&nbsp; testified that she&nbsp; is the&nbsp; live-in&nbsp; partner of&nbsp; Jimmy. It was&nbsp; not&nbsp; true&nbsp; that&nbsp; Jimmy&nbsp; was involved in selling drugs. On March 4, 2016, Rosalinda instructed Jimmy to buy Salbutamol because their son was experiencing an asthma attack. Rosalinda wondered why it took Jimmy so long to buy the medicine. Rosalinda learned about the arrest of Jimmy through a niece. At the precinct, Rosalinda told the police officers that Jimmy was just tending to his "lugawan" and had never been involved in selling drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>In the assailed Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated October 10,2016, the RTC ruled that all the elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs were established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Similarly, all the elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs were proven by the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; It further ruled that the defense of Jimmy that the&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; against&nbsp; him&nbsp; was&nbsp; merely planted&nbsp; after&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; able&nbsp; to produce the money that PO3 Julius R. Congson (PO3 Congson) demanded from him is without merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The defenses of frame-up and extortion interposed by an accused are usually viewed with disfavor as they can easily be&nbsp; concocted&nbsp; and&nbsp; are&nbsp; common&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; standard&nbsp; defense&nbsp; ploys&nbsp; in&nbsp; most prosecution of violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; It also held that the testimony of Jimmy's wife is self-serving.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The RTC further ruled that the fact that the marking of the recovered drugs was only done at the PCP-9 office and not immediately after their confiscation&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; in any way taint their&nbsp; weight&nbsp; as&nbsp; evidence against Jimmy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; It&nbsp; held&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution&nbsp; substantially&nbsp; complied&nbsp; with&nbsp; the requirements under RA 9165 and sufficiently established the crucial links in the chain of custody. Thus, the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized shabu remained unimpaired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>,&nbsp; premises&nbsp; considered, judgment&nbsp; Is&nbsp; hereby rendered as follows, to wit:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 302-V-16 finding accused JIMMY FULINARA y&nbsp; FABELENIA&nbsp; GUILTY&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 5, Article II of RA&nbsp; 9165 and, this Court sentences him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a FINE of P500,000.00.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 303-V-16, finding accused JIMMY FULINARA y&nbsp; FABELENIA&nbsp;&nbsp; GUILTY&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond&nbsp; reasonable&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; of violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 and, this Court sentences him to suffer imprisonment of 12 years and One (1) day to Twenty (20) years and a FINE of P300,000.00.<br><br>Pursuant&nbsp; to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, [his] preventive imprisonment shall be credited in full to his favor.<br><br>The subject sachets of shabu are hereby ordered confiscated and forfeited in favor of the government to be dealt with in accordance with law.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>Aggrieved, Jimmy appealed to the CA.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b></center><br><br>In the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; dated November 29, 2017, the CA affirmed Jimmy's conviction.

The provision requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed&nbsp; <b><u>immediately&nbsp; after seizure&nbsp; or confiscation</u></b>;&nbsp; and (2) the physical inventory and photographing must be done <b><u>in the presence of (a) the accused&nbsp; or his/her&nbsp; representative&nbsp; or counsel,&nbsp; (b) an elected&nbsp; public official, (c) a representative from the media or a representative from the National Prosecution Service</u></b> (NPS) all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same and the seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within twenty-four (24) hours from confiscation for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension. It is only when&nbsp; the same is&nbsp; not&nbsp; practicable&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; Implementing&nbsp; Rules&nbsp; and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 allow the inventory and photographing to be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; <b>In this connection, this also means that the two required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of the conduct of the inventory of the seized items which, again,&nbsp; must&nbsp; be immediately done at&nbsp; the place of seizure and confiscation — <u>a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity</u></b>. Verily, a buy-bust team normally has sufficient time to gather and bring with them the said witnesses.<br><br>The Court, however, has clarified that under varied field conditions, strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; and, the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of RA 9165 does not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items void and invalid. However, this is with the caveat that the prosecution still needs to satisfactorily prove that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It has been repeatedly emphasized by the Court that the prosecution has the positive duty to explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Without any justifiable explanation, which must be proven as a fact,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; the evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i> is unreliable, and the acquittal of the accused should follow on the ground that his guilt has not been shown beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><i>The&nbsp; buy-bust&nbsp; team&nbsp; failed&nbsp; to&nbsp; comply<br>with&nbsp; the&nbsp; mandatory&nbsp; requirements<br>under Section 21.</i><br><br>In the present case, the buy-bust team failed to strictly comply with the mandatory requirements under Section 21(1) of RA 9165.<br><br><i>First</i>, none of the two required witnesses&nbsp; was present&nbsp; at the time of arrest of the accused&nbsp; and the seizure of the drugs. The&nbsp; barangay&nbsp; kagawad was merely "called-in" at the police station.&nbsp; As testified&nbsp; by PO2 Congson himself:<blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="center">"Q </div></td> <td width="95%" valign="top"> <div align="justify"><b>After arriving at PCP-9 for the inventory, what did you do next?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center"><b>A</b> </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>We called for the barangay kagawad, Sir.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">Q </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Who is this Barangay Kagawad?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><br></td> <td valign="top"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify">Barangay Kagawad Rommel Mercado, Sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>It bears emphasis that the presence of the required witnesses at the time of the apprehension and inventory is mandatory, and that the law imposes the said requirement because their presence serves an essential purpose. In <i>People v. Tomawis</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; the Court elucidated on the purpose of the law in mandating the presence of the required witnesses as follows:<br><blockquote>The presence of&nbsp; the witnesses from the DOJ,&nbsp; media, and from public elective office is necessary to protect against the possibility of planting, contamination, or loss of the seized drug.&nbsp; Using the language of the Court in <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; without the <i><b>insulating presence</b></i> of the representative from the media or the DOJ and any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the subject sachet that were evidence of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.<br></blockquote><blockquote>The&nbsp; presence of&nbsp; the&nbsp; three&nbsp; witnesses must&nbsp; be&nbsp; secured&nbsp; not&nbsp; only during the inventory but more importantly&nbsp; <u><b>at the time of the warrantless arrest</b></u>.&nbsp; It is at this point in which the presence of the three witnesses is most needed, as it is their presence at the time of seizure and confiscation that would belie any doubt as to the source, identity, and Integrity of the seized drug.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the buy-bust operation is legitimately conducted, the presence&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; insulating&nbsp; witnesses&nbsp; would&nbsp; also&nbsp; controvert&nbsp; the&nbsp; usual defense of frame-up as the witnesses would be able to testify that the buy­ bust&nbsp; operation&nbsp; and&nbsp; inventory&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized&nbsp; drugs&nbsp; were&nbsp; done&nbsp; in&nbsp; their presence in accordance with Section 21 of RA 9165.<br><br>The practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so — and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished — does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs.<br><br>To restate, the presence of the three witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with at the time of the warrantless arrest; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and underscoring in the original)</blockquote><i>Second</i>,&nbsp; the police officers offered the flimsy excuse that an alleged commotion occurred as the reason why they decided to conduct the marking, inventory, and photography of the seized items at the police station instead of the place of arrest.
