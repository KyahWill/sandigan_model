In order not to render moot the issue in this case, the Court issued a TRO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA committed grave abuse of discretion in directing an entry of judgment in the case, and denying petitioners' motion to recall the same, despite their claim of lack of proper service of the March 22, 2013 Decision.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provides that "if any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court." <b>Thus, even if a party represented by counsel has been actually notified, said notice is not considered notice in law.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> "The reason is simple - the parties, generally, have no formal education or knowledge of the rules of procedure, specifically, the mechanics of an appeal or availment of legal remedies; thus, they may also be unaware of the rights and duties of a litigant relative to the receipt of a decision. More importantly, it is best for the courts to deal only with one person in the interest of orderly procedure - either the lawyer retained by the party or the party him/herself if [he/she] does not intend to hire a lawyer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"></sup><br>As to service of judgments and proof thereof, Sections 7 and 13, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court pertinently provide:<br><blockquote>Section 7. <i>Service by mail</i>. - Service by registered mail shall be made by depositing the copy in the post office in a sealed envelope, plainly addressed to the party or his counsel at his office, if known, otherwise at his residence, if known, with postage fully prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after ten (10) days if undelivered. If no registry service is available in the locality of either the senders or the addressee, service may be done by ordinary mail.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 13. <i>Proof of service</i>. - x x x If the service is by ordinary mail, proof thereof shall consist of an <b>affidavit of the person mailing of facts showing compliance with Section 7</b> of this Rule. <b>If service is made by registered mail</b>, proof shall be made by such affidavit and the <b>registry receipt issued by the mailing office</b>. <b>The registry return card shall be filed immediately upon its receipt by the sender</b>, or in lieu thereof the unclaimed letter together with the certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the postmaster to the addressee. (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the registry return card pertaining to Atty. Advincula, Jr.'s copy of the notice was not returned to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> However, the CA concluded that the notice was received by Atty. Advincula, Jr. on the basis of the reply to tracer of William H. Olmoguez, Postmaster of Davao City, that a certain Ariel Hernandez received the notice on May 8, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> But in his request manifestation, Atty. Advincula, Jr. denied having received such notice and knowing Ariel Hernandez, which was not refuted by respondents.<br><br>It must be stressed that the mail matter must be received by the addressee or his duly authorized representative since service on a person who was not a clerk, employee or one in charge of the attorney's office, is invalid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> "<b>[S]ervice of the court's order upon any person other than the counsel of record is not legally effective and binding upon the party, nor may it start the corresponding reglementary period for the subsequent procedural steps that may be taken by the attorney.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Since Ariel Hernandez was not an employee and, thus, not authorized to receive court notices in behalf of Atty. Advincula, Jr., his alleged receipt of the notice of the March 22, 2013 Decision on May 8, 2013 is without any effect in law, and cannot start the running of the period within which to file a motion for reconsideration or appeal.<br><br>Notably, Atty. Advincula, Jr. likewise withdrew as counsel for petitioners with the conformity of Virgilio, which was approved by the CA.<br><br>Having been informed that the withdrawing counsel has not been duly served with notice of the March 22, 2013 Decision, and considering further that no new counsel has entered any appearance in behalf of plaintiffs Villalongha, the CA should have ensured that the latter were duly served notice thereof, but it did not. While it originally sent a copy of the said Decision to them under registered letter No. 03562 on April 12, 2013, the same was unserved, and thus, returned to sender.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Nonetheless, it bears to reiterate that such earlier notice is not considered notice in law since plaintiffs Villalongha were then represented by counsel.<br><br>While Virgilio received a copy of the June 3, 2015 Resolution (noting without action Atty. Advincula, Jr.'s request manifestation), and manifested that plaintiffs Villalongha will engage a new counsel "to whom a copy of the x x x [March 22, 2013 Decision may] be served,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> neither plaintiffs Villalongha nor Atty. Abejaron who subsequently entered his appearance for petitioners was served a copy of the March 22, 2013 Decision.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that plaintiffs Villalongha have not been duly served with notice of the March 22, 2013 Decision; hence, the period within which they may file a motion for reconsideration has not commenced to run. Thus, the Entry of Judgment made in the case on the ground that the said Decision had become final and executory on May 24, 2013 or after the lapse of the fifteen (15) day period from the <u>invalid receipt</u> by Ariel Hernandez was therefore premature and inefficacious, and should be recalled and lifted. An entry of judgment merely records the fact that a judgment, order or resolution has become final and executory; but it is not the operative act that makes such judgment, order or resolution final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In the case at bar, the Entry of Judgment did not make the March 22, 2013 Decision final and executory considering that as of the date of entry, notice of said Decision has not yet been served on plaintiffs Villalongha/petitioners. Consequently, the Court finds that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its July 7, 2016 Resolution directing entry of judgment in the case, and the September 20, 2016 Resolution noting without action petitioners' motion to recall such entry.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Resolutions dated July 7, 2016 and September 20, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01027-MIN are <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and the Entry of Judgment dated July 7, 2016 is <b>RECALLED</b>. The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to the CA which is hereby ordered to furnish petitioners, through counsel, a copy of the March 22, 2013 Decision and give petitioners a period of fifteen (15) days from such notice to file their motion for reconsideration therefrom.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Bersamin, C.
