				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 spells out strict chain of custody requirements. Noncompliance with these requirements may only be excused upon a showing of justifiable grounds <i>and</i> specific measures taken by law enforcers to preserve the integrity of items allegedly seized from an accused. The prosecution's failure to demonstrate these amounts to its failure to establish the<i> corpus delicti</i> of drug offenses. The accused's acquittal must then ensue. <p> This Court resolves an appeal from the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed the October 3, 2011 Decision of the Regional Trial Court, which convicted Victor Sumilip y Tillo (Sumilip) of the charge of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p><p> In an Information, Sumilip was charged with violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The Information read: </p><blockquote> <p> That on or about the 4<sup>th</sup> day of July 2009, in the City of San Fernando, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above-named accused, without the necessary permit or authority from the proper governmental agency or office, did then and there, unlawfully and feloniously for and in consideration of the sum of money in the amount of FIVE HUNDRED Pesos (PHP500.00) Philippine Currency, sell and deliver FIFTY ONE point FIFTEEN (51.15) GRAMS OF Marijuana, a dangerous drug, wrapped in newspaper to PO2 Ricardo Annague who posed as buyer thereof using marked money, a five hundred pesos bill bearing serial No. CQ318210. </p> <p> CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> On arraignment, Sumilip pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> During trial, the prosecution presented three (3) witnesses: (1) Police Officer 2 Ricardo Annague (PO2 Annague); (2) Police Officer 3 Paul Batnag (PO3 Batnag); and (3) Police Senior Inspector Anamelisa Bacani.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> According to the prosecution, at about 1:00 p.m. on July 4, 2009, a confidential informant reported to PO2 Annague that a certain "Victor Sumilip" was selling illegal drugs along Ancheta Street, Catbangen, San Fernando City, La Union. A buy-bust team was then formed with PO2 Annague as the designated poseur-buyer and PO3 Batnag as back-up. A P500.00 bill was prepared as the buy-bust money. It was agreed on that PO2 Annague would remove his cap to signify to the rest of the team that the sale of drugs had been consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> The team later went to La Union Medical Diagnostic Center on Ancheta Street, where PO2 Annague and the informant approached Sumilip. After the informant had introduced PO2 Annague as an interested marijuana buyer, Sumilip took out of his left pocket marijuana leaves wrapped in newspaper and handed them to PO2 Annague. In exchange, PO2 Annague handed Sumilip the marked P500.00 bill. At this, PO2 Annague removed his cap, signaling the consummation of the sale. Then, with PO3 Batnag's aid, PO2 Annague arrested Sumilip and informed him of his constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> Sumilip and the marijuana were then taken to the San Fernando Police Station. There, PO2 Annague marked, inventoried, and photographed the seized marijuana in the presence of Sumilip and some barangay officials. Thereafter, the marijuana was brought to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Sumilip, his sister Carla Maanes, and his cousin Julie Estacio, testified for the defense. From their testimonies, the defense alleged that while Sumilip was eating in a <i>turo-turo</i> restaurant on Ancheta Street at around 11:10 a.m. on July 4, 2009, two (2) men in civilian clothing approached and aimed a gun at him. After they had ordered Sumilip to get up, the men held his hand, frisked him, and searched his bag. They forced him to board a car and brought him to Tanqui Police Station. Later on, he was brought back to the restaurant where the two (2) men simulated his arrest for supposedly selling marijuana.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> In its October 3, 2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Regional Trial Court found Sumilip guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The dispositive portion of this Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused VICTOR SUMILIP Y Tillio (<i>sic</i>) is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for violating Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of five hundred thousand pesos Php)500,000). (<i>sic</i>) </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In its assailed Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision, as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision dated October 3, 2011 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San Fernando City, La Union, Branch 66 in Criminal Case No. 8384 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> In affirming Sumilip's conviction, the Court of Appeals reasoned that the prosecution demonstrated an unbroken chain of custody of the marijuana taken from Sumilip.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It did not lend credence to Sumilip's denial and allegation of being framed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Thus, Sumilip filed his Notice of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> In a February 14, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> this Court's First Division dismissed Sumilip's appeal. </p><p> On June 14, 2018, Sumilip filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He maintains that the prosecution failed to show an unbroken chain of custody of the marijuana supposedly seized from him. He emphasizes that the prosecution failed to account for how the marijuana was handled upon seizure. He notes that the identity of the person who had custody of the marijuana from the place of his arrest to the police station was never disclosed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> Acting on the Motion for Reconsideration, this Court, in its August 28, 2019 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> reinstated Sumilip's appeal. </p><p> For this Court's resolution is the issue of whether or not accused­ appellant Victor Sumilip y Tillo is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs. </p><p> Conviction in criminal cases demands that the prosecution prove an accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Rule 133, Section 2 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2. Proof beyond reasonable doubt. — In a criminal case, the accused is entitled to an acquittal, unless his guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty. Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind. </p> </blockquote> <p> This quantum of proof imposes upon the prosecution the burden to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The prosecution must do so by presenting its own evidence, without relying on the weakness of the arguments and proof of the defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This proceeds from the constitutional mandate of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In <i>Daayata v. People</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Proof beyond reasonable doubt charges the prosecution with the immense responsibility of establishing moral certainty. The prosecution's case must rise on its own merits, not merely on relative strength as against that of the defense. Should the prosecution fail to discharge its burden, acquittal must follow as a matter of course.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires proof of its elements: </p><blockquote> <p> In actions involving the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the following elements must first be established: (1) proof that the transaction or sale took place and (2) the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Establishing the<i> corpus delicti</i> requires strict compliance with the chain of custody requirements spelled out by the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.

Holgado</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court explained the importance of preserving the integrity of items seized during drug operations: </p> <blockquote> <p> The identity of the prohibited drug must be established with moral certainty. Apart from showing that the elements of possession or sale are present, the fact that the substance illegally possessed and sold in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must likewise be established with the same degree of certitude as that needed to sustain a guilty verdict.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, in <i>People v. Belocura</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> where the identity of the allegedly seized drug was not established, this Court discussed: </p><blockquote> <p> Worse, the Prosecution failed to establish the identity of the prohibited drug that constituted the <i>corpus delicti</i> itself. The omission naturally raises grave doubt about any search being actually conducted and warrants the suspicion that the prohibited drugs were planted evidence. </p> <p> In every criminal prosecution for possession of illegal drugs, the Prosecution must account for the custody of the incriminating evidence from the moment of seizure and confiscation until the moment it is offered in evidence. That account goes to the weight of evidence. It is not enough that the evidence offered has probative value on the issues, for the evidence must also be sufficiently connected to and tied with the facts in issue. The evidence is not relevant merely because it is available but that it has an actual connection with the transaction involved and with the parties thereto. This is the reason why authentication and laying a foundation for the introduction of evidence are important.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Without credible proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, there can be no crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs. There is no nexus between whatever items are presented in court and the transaction or activity attributed to an accused. Ultimately, then, the accused cannot be said to have been the author of the alleged illegal act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> The chain of custody requirements are not a trivial, hollow list of procedural niceties. Rather: </p><blockquote> <p> . . . they are calibrated to preserve the even greater interest of due process and the constitutional rights of those who stand to suffer from the State's legitimate use of force, and therefore, stand to be deprived of liberty, property, and, should capital punishment be imposed, life. This calibration balances the need for effective prosecution of those involved in illegal drugs and the preservation of the most basic liberties that typify our democratic order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Section 21's mandated chain of custody consists of four (4) links. In each of these links, the prosecution must account for the manner of handling and turnover of the seized items to every designated person or officer forming part of the chain. In <i>People v. Nandi</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he following links should be established in the chain of custody of the confiscated item: <b><i>first</i></b>, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <b><i>second</i></b>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <b><i>third</i></b>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and <b><i>fourth</i></b>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> A failure to make such an account at any stage amounts to a broken chain of custody and diminishes the evidentiary value of whatever items are eventually presented in court. </p><p> There are, however, instances when strict compliance with Section 21 is concededly impossible or impracticable. Noncompliance may be excused when the prosecution establishes that: (1) there is a justifiable ground for noncompliance; and (2) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The prosecution must address every procedural lapse. To satisfy a court that the drugs or drug-related items it is presenting are authentic and have been preserved, the prosecution must plead and prove justifiable grounds and the specific measures taken by law enforcers to maintain the seized items' integrity. In <i>People v. Angeles</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [B]efore substantial compliance with the procedure is permitted, not only must the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs seized be preserved, there must be a justifiable ground for its noncompliance in the first place. <i>The prosecution has a two-fold duty of identifying any lapse in procedure and proving the existence of a sufficient reason why it was not strictly followed.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>III </b> </p><p> The assailed Court of Appeals Decision glossed over the police officers' glaring failure to comply with the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act's chain of custody requirements. </p><p> The apprehending officers failed to credibly mark, inventory, and take photographs of the allegedly seized marijuana. Section 21(1) of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act requires inventory and taking of photographs "<i>immediately after seizure and confiscation</i>[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It also requires the presence of the accused, an elected public official, a Department of Justice representative, and a media representative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> In <i>People v. Tomawis</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> this Court discussed the requirement of immediacy in relation to the presence of the necessary witnesses: </p><blockquote> <p> The phrase "immediately after seizure and confiscation" means that the physical inventory and photographing of the drugs were intended by the law to be made immediately after, or at the place of apprehension. And only if this is not practicable, the IRR allows that the inventory and photographing could be done as soon as the buy-bust team reaches the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team. By the same token, however, this also means that the three required witnesses should already be physically present at the time of apprehension — a requirement that can easily be complied with by the buy-bust team considering that the buy-bust operation is, by its nature, a planned activity. Simply put, the buy-bust team has enough time and opportunity to bring with them said witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court further explained: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he presence of the [four] witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation of the drugs must be secured and complied with at the time of the warrantless arrest; such that they are required to be at or near the intended place of the arrest so that they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs "immediately after seizure and confiscation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The inventory and taking of photographs must, as a rule, be done at the actual place of apprehension. Likewise, the required witnesses must be present right during the apprehension and not only during the subsequent marking, inventory, and taking of photographs. </p><p> In this case, the marking, inventory, and taking of photographs were not done immediately after the apprehension. Rather, the police officers took time to transfer to the San Fernando Police Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Only barangay officials were claimed by the prosecution to be present during the belated marking, inventory, and taking of photographs. There was no Department of Justice Representative. Neither was there a media representative. Worse, there is no showing that even those barangay officials were present during the actual apprehension. </p><p> Yet, just as glaring is the prosecution's failure to specify any justification for the police officers' lapses or a satisfactorily detailed account of measures they had taken to preserve the allegedly seized marijuana's identity. The prosecution appears content to have courts merely accept its own self-serving guarantees. </p><p> Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals was quick to conclude that "the prosecution has sufficiently established the continuous and unbroken chain of custody of the illegal seized item."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> According to it: </p><blockquote> <p> First, the seizure of the confiscated marijuana was established thru the statements of both PO2 Annague and PO3 Batnag and the Certification of Inventory. According to their testimonies, after they arrested accused-appellant, they took pictures, together with the barangay officials of the seized illegal drug and prepared the certificate of inventory. The marking is evident in the newspaper used in wrapping the marijuana leaves and the marked money, which revealed the initial "RAA". The occurrence of the second link is illustrated when Police Inspector Jessie L. Quesada prepared a Request for Laboratory Examination of the seized illegal drug. The third and final link does not need to be established as the parties have stipulated that the specimen subject of this case is the same specimen submitted to the forensic chemist for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court of Appeals failed to consider that the prosecution did not identify the person who had custody of the allegedly seized marijuana from the time of arrest to when it was marked, inventoried, and photographed. Worse, the prosecution made no averments as to the measures taken by that custodian to maintain the identity and integrity of the allegedly seized marijuana. </p><p> In <i>People v. Dela Cruz</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court was not impressed by the guarantees of a police officer who, having initial custody of seized sachets supposedly containing shabu, merely kept those sachets in his pocket up until they were handed over for examination: </p><blockquote> <p> The prosecution effectively admits that from the moment of the supposed buy-bust operation until the seized items' turnover for examination, these items had been in the sole possession of a police officer. In fact, not only had they been in his possession, they had been in such close proximity to him that they had been nowhere else but in his own pockets. </p> <p> Keeping one of the seized items in his right pocket and the rest in his left pocket is a doubtful and suspicious way of ensuring the integrity of the items. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' finding that PO1 Bobon took the necessary precautions, we find his actions reckless, if not dubious. </p> <p> Even without referring to the strict requirements of Section 21, common sense dictates that a single police officer's act of bodily-keeping the item(s) which is at the crux of offenses penalized under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, is fraught with dangers. One need not engage in a meticulous counter-checking with the requirements of Section 21 to view with distrust the items coming out of PO1 Bobon's pockets. That the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals both failed to see through this and fell — hook, line, and sinker — for PO1 Bobon's avowals is mind-boggling. </p> <p> Moreover, PO1 Bobon did so without even offering the slightest justification for dispensing with the requirements of Section 21. </p> <p> Section 21, paragraph 1, of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, includes a proviso to the effect that "noncompliance of (sic) these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items." Plainly, the prosecution has not shown that — on September 14, 2004, when dela Cruz was arrested and the sachets supposedly seized and marked — there were "justifiable grounds" for dispensing with compliance with Section 21. All that the prosecution has done is insist on its self-serving assertion that the integrity of the seized sachets has, despite all its lapses, nevertheless been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Dela Cruz</i>, this Court considered as unreliable the keeping of allegedly seized sachets in an officer's pockets. This, even as the prosecution insisted that the officer's act of segregating sachets in different pockets was an ample safeguard. </p><p> The situation here is significantly worse than that in <i>Dela Cruz</i>. The prosecution here not only failed to allege a semblance of precautionary measures, but it never even named the person having custody of the drug alleged seized. Where the prosecution in <i>Dela Cruz</i> failed to impress, with greater reason should this Court, in this case, refrain from condoning the prosecution's inadequacies. The utter dearth of specific and detailed accounts on how the allegedly seized marijuana's identity and integrity were preserved while in transit is a glaring, fatal flaw vis-a-vis Section 21's mandate. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> The police officers' failure to properly adhere to the chain of custody requirements cannot be swept away by the convenient presumption that they acted accordingly. This Court has previously explained that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties only benefits officers who were shown to have acted in keeping with established standards. It cannot cure irregularities and manifest deviations from what is legally required: </p><blockquote> <p> A presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is made in the context of an existing rule of law or statute authorizing the performance of an act or duty or prescribing a procedure in the performance thereof. The presumption applies when nothing in the record suggests that the law enforcers deviated from the standard conduct of official duty required by law; where the official act is irregular on its face, the presumption cannot arise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> This case is littered with fatal gaps in the custody of the item, which is at the core of accused-appellant's prosecution. Far from displaying the diligence apropos to establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the prosecution has been content on relying on its own assurances and misplaced presumptions. This Court takes this opportunity to correct the error validated by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. Accused­ appellant's guilt has not been shown beyond reasonable doubt. He must be acquitted. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the May 21, 2015 Decision of the Court of Appeals m CA-G.R. CR. HC No. 05301 is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. </p><p> Accused-appellant Victor Sumilip y Tillo is <b>ACQUITTED</b> for the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
