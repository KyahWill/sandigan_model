(Emphases supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Given that the status of the above-mentioned lands was not examined under the context of Section 10 (a) of RA 6657, as amended, the Court finds that there is a need to <strong>refer</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> the matter to the Office of the DAR Secretary<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> for the purpose of determining whether or not the same are actually, directly and exclusively used for parks, forest reserves, reforestation, or watersheds as to be exempt from CARP coverage in accordance with Section 10 (a) of RA 6657, as amended, pursuant to the guidelines set by DAR AO No. 13-90. </p><p> With respect to the lands covered by TCT Nos. 164414, 164415, 164416, 164417, and (164430) 422059<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> which have been <i>secondarily</i> reclassified as <u>agro-industrial</u>, the Court finds the DAR Secretary to have erred in excluding the same from the CARP <b>pursuant to Section 3 (c) of RA 6657, as amended</b>. DOJ Opinion No. 67, Series of 2006<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> dated September 25, 2006 provides that <strong>agro-industrial lands are within the ambit or coverage of the definition of agricultural land</strong> under Section 3 (c) of RA 6657, as amended, considering that: (<em>a</em>) they are neither included in the enumeration of exclusion provided in the said definition nor mentioned under Section 10<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> of the same law to be exempt from CARP coverage; and (<em>b</em>) the legislative intent to include agro-industrial land within the coverage of the agrarian reform program was specifically documented in the records of the Philippine Senate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, Section 4 (d) of RA 6657, as amended provides that the law covers "[a]ll private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that can be raised thereon." In <em>Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. CA</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> it was clarified that <strong>agricultural lands are only those lands which are arable or suitable lands that do not include commercial, industrial, and residential lands.</strong> Thus, unless the agro-industrial land is shown to be not arable, or is devoted to exempt activities such as commercial livestock, poultry and swine raising,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> fishpond and prawn farming,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> cattle-raising,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> or other activities which do not involve the growing of crops and accordingly reclassified therefor, the said land shall be within the coverage of the CARP. </p><p> Accordingly, only the exclusion of the portions of the lands covered by TCT Nos. 164416, 164417, 164418, 164419, 164420, and (164432) M-13551 which have been reclassified as <u>residential or institutional</u> per the HSRC-approved LUP of Jalajala should be upheld since lands reclassified as non-agricultural prior to the effectivity of RA 6657 by government agencies other than the DAR are outside CARP coverage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> </p><p> However, it bears to stress that while DAR AO No. 6, Series of 1994 declares that the reclassification of lands to non-agricultural uses shall not operate to divest FBs of their rights over lands covered by PD 27, such <b><u>rights must have vested prior to June 15, 1988</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Notably, the reclassification of the subject lands in 1981 came prior to the issuance and registration of EPs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> and CLOAs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> in favor of the FBs between October 24, 1988 and October 27, 1995, and way before the issuance of the January 14, 1986 memorandum of the President directing the issuance of EPs to the FBs of the OLT program pursuant to which EPs were issued to individual FBs. Since the rights and responsibilities of beneficiaries shall only commence from their <b><u>receipt of duly registered EPs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> or CLOAs</u></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> undeniably, no vested rights had accrued in favor of the concerned FBs prior to the reclassification of the subject lands. Hence, the affected FBs cannot invoke the issuance of EP and CLOA titles in their favor as a bar to the exemption case.</p><p> In sum, the Court finds that the CA committed reversible error in upholding the DAR Secretary's ruling excluding: (a) portions of the lands covered by TCT Nos. 164410 to 164415 (inclusive), 164417 and (164430) 422059 on the basis of their HSRC-approved reclassification as <u>forest conservation zone</u> since only forest lands primarily classified by the DENR are exempt from CARP coverage pursuant to Section 3 (c) of RA 6657, as amended; and (b) portions of the lands covered by TCT Nos. 164414, 164415, 164416, 164417, and (164430) 422059 on the basis of their<em> secondary </em>reclassification as <u>agro-industrial</u> since agro-industrial lands are within the ambit or coverage of the definition of agricultural land, and as such, covered by the CARP. However, anent the lands in item (a), they may nonetheless be exempt from CARP coverage if they are actually, directly and exclusively used for parks, forest reserves, reforestation, or watersheds under Section 10 (a) of RA 6657, as amended upon determination of the Office of the DAR Secretary. </p><p> On the other hand, the Court finds the CA to have correctly affirmed the exclusion of the portions of the lands covered by TCT Nos. 164416, 164417, 164418, 164419, 164420, and (164432) M-13551 which have been reclassified as <u>residential or institutional</u>.</p><p> Nonetheless, <b>before the application for exemption may be completely granted, payment of disturbance compensation to any affected tenants of the properly excluded portions</b> — <em>herein limited to the residential or institutional lands covered by TCT Nos. 164416, 164417, 164418, 164419, 164420, and (164432) M-13551 per the HSRC-approved LUP of Jalajala</em> — <b>must first be made</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> This is because once a leasehold relationship is established, the agricultural lessee is entitled to security of tenure and acquires the right to continue working on the landholding until such leasehold relation is extinguished,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> and he/she is validly dispossessed thereof for cause, among others, the reclassification of the land into residential, commercial, industrial or some other urban purposes is upheld in a final and executory Court judgment, thereby entitling him to disturbance compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> In addition, the <u>usufructuary rights</u> of the affected FBs over their awarded lands shall not be diminished<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> pending the cancellation of their EP and CLOA titles in the proper proceedings. </p><p> Finally, contrary to petitioners' claim, the fact that Juliana had previously voluntarily offered to sell the subject lands to the DAR is inconsequential and is not a bar to the exemption case.
