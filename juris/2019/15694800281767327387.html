They argue that the Regional Trial Court did not acquire jurisdiction over them as it had failed to serve the summons and copies of the Petition on Certiorari and Prohibition personally on petitioners. They maintain that under the Rules of Court, summons shall be served upon respondent himself, not his counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> Petitioners, likewise, argue that since the Office of the Solicitor General is regarded in criminal cases as the appellate counsel of the People of the Philippines, it should have been given an opportunity to be heard on behalf of the People.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> Petitioners similarly contend that the filing of a Petition for Certiorari was improper since the remedy of appeal was available to respondent.

He insists that Rule 65 only states that if the court finds the petition for certiorari to be sufficient in form and substance, it shall issue an order requiring the respondents to comment on it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> Respondent maintains that contrary to petitioners' assertion, a petition for certiorari is the proper remedy to assail the November 21, 2013 Order of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities. He claims that it is an interlocutory order from which no appeal may be taken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, respondent insists that the Municipal Trial Court in Cities committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing the Judicial Affidavits' belated submission. He asserts that while the Judicial Affidavit Rule allows their belated submission, the delay must be for a valid reason. He contends that the excuse offered—"for whatever reason"—does not constitute a valid justification warranting the relaxation of the rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Finally, respondent claims that his failure to attach the stenographic notes was not a fatal error meriting the dismissal of his Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition.

Lim and People of the Philippines;</p><p> Second, whether or not the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition was the proper remedy to question the November 21, 2013 Order of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities; and</p><p> Finally, whether or not the Municipal Trial Court in Cities committed grave abuse of discretion in allowing the belated submission of the Judicial Affidavits.</p><p> Petitioners' arguments lack merit.</p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Petitioners mainly argue that since no summons had been served upon them, the Regional Trial Court failed to acquire jurisdiction over them. As a result, they insist that the Regional Trial Court's June 6, 2014 Decision is void.</p><p> Contrary to petitioners' postulation, summons need not be issued in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.</p><p> Under the Rules of Court, there are two (2) types of civil actions: (1) ordinary civil actions; and (2) special civil actions. Both are governed by the rules for ordinary civil actions. However, special civil actions, such as petitions for certiorari, are further subject to certain specific rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p>Rule 65, Section 6 of the Rules of Court states that the court, upon the filing of a petition for certiorari, shall determine if it is sufficient in form and substance. Once it finds the petition to be sufficient, it shall issue an order requiring the respondents to comment on the petition: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 6. Order to Comment. — If the petition is sufficient in form and substance to justify such process, the court shall issue an order requiring the respondent or respondents to comment on the petition within ten (10) days from receipt of a copy thereof. Such order shall be served on the respondents in such manner as the court may direct, together with a copy of the petition and any annexes thereto. </p> <p> In petitions for certiorari before the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, the provisions of Section 2, Rule 56, shall be observed. Before giving due course thereto, the court may require the respondents to file their comment to, and not a motion to dismiss, the petition. Thereafter, the court may require the filing of a reply and such other responsive or other pleadings as it may deem necessary and proper. </p> </blockquote> <p> Compared with an ordinary civil action, where summons must be issued upon the filing of the complaint,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the court need only issue an order requiring the respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari. "Such order shall be served on the respondents in such manner as the court may direct, together with a copy of the petition and any annexes thereto."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> In any case, despite petitioners' insistence that they were not served with summons, it must be noted that on January 29, 2014, the Regional Trial Court served the summons and a copy of the Petition on petitioner Ronald, through his counsel Attorney Alfredo Arungayan III (Atty. Arungayan).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p>Similarly, the People of the Philippines, as represented by the City Prosecutor of Iloilo City, and Judge Ofelia M. Artuz, through her Branch Clerk of Court, were served with summons and copies of the Petition on January 30, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p>Furthermore, it must be stressed that in <em>People's General Insurance Corporation v. Guansing</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> this Court reasoned that when a party participates in a proceeding despite improper service of summons, he or she is deemed to have voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction. </p><p> Here, petitioners filed before the Regional Trial Court a Comment/Opposition to the prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> on January 30, 2014 and a Comment/Opposition to the Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> on February 10, 2014. By actively participating in the proceedings, petitioners are deemed to have made a voluntary appearance and cannot argue that the Regional Trial Court did not acquire jurisdiction over them. </p><p> Finally, petitioners argue that the Office of the Solicitor General should have been served with a copy of the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition. However, under the Rules of Court, when a petition for certiorari is filed assailing an act of a judge, the petitioner in the main action shall be included as a private respondent, and is then mandated to appear and defend both on his or her own behalf and on behalf of the public respondent affected by the proceedings. The public respondent shall not be required to comment on the petition unless required by the court. Rule 65, Section 5 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 5. Respondents and Costs in Certain Cases. — <em>When the petition filed relates to the acts or omissions of a judge</em>, court, quasi-judicial agency, tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, <em>the petitioner shall join, as private respondent or respondents with such public respondent or respondents, the person or persons interested in sustaining the proceedings in the court; and <u>it shall be the duty of such private respondents to appear and defend, both in his or their own behalf and in behalf of the public respondent or respondents affected by the proceedings</u></em>, and the costs awarded in such proceedings in favor of the petitioner shall be against the private respondents only, and not against the judge, court, quasi-judicial agency, tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person impleaded as public respondent or respondents. </p> <p> Unless otherwise specifically directed by the court where the petition is pending, the public respondents shall not appear in or file an answer or comment to the petition or any pleading therein. If the case is elevated to a higher court by either party, the public respondents shall be included therein as nominal parties. However, unless otherwise specifically directed by the court, they shall not appear or participate in the proceedings therein. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> This Court shall discuss the second and third issues simultaneously as they are interrelated with each other. </p><p> Settled is the rule that "the remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> When the remedy of appeal is available to a litigant, a petition for certiorari shall not be entertained and should be dismissed for being an improper remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p> Under the Rules of Court, an appeal is a remedy directed against a "judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by these Rules to be appealable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It cannot be availed of against an interlocutory order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p> In <i>Denso (Philippines), Inc. v. The Intermediate Appellate Court</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court distinguished a final order or judgment from an interlocutory order: </p><blockquote> <p> The concept of 'final' judgment, as distinguished from one which has 'become final' (or 'executory' as of right [final and executory]), is definite and settled. A 'final' judgment or order is one that finally disposes of a case, leaving nothing more to be done by the Court in respect thereto, e.g., an adjudication on the merits which, on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial declares categorically what the rights and obligations of the parties are and which party is in the right; or a judgment or order that dismisses an action on the ground, for instance, of <em>res judicata</em> or prescription. Once rendered, the task of the Court is ended, as far as deciding the controversy or determining the rights and liabilities of the litigants is concerned. Nothing more remains to be done by the Court except to await the parties' next move (which among others, may consist of the filing of a motion for new trial or reconsideration, or the taking of an appeal) and ultimately, of course, to cause the execution of the judgment once it becomes 'final' or, to use the established and more distinctive term, 'final and executory.'</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Conversely, an order that does not finally dispose of the case, and does not end the Court's task of adjudicating the parties' contentions and determining their rights and liabilities as regards each other, but obviously indicates that other things remain to be done by the Court, is 'interlocutory,' e.g., an order denying a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules, or granting a motion for extension of time to file a pleading, or authorizing amendment thereof, or granting or denying applications for postponement, or production or inspection of documents or things, etc. Unlike a 'final' judgment or order, which is appealable, as above pointed out, an 'interlocutory' order may not be questioned on appeal except only as part of an appeal that may eventually be taken from the final judgment rendered in the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In contrast, a petition for certiorari is a remedy directed not only to correct errors of jurisdiction, "but also to set right, undo[,] and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> As ruled in <i>Cruz v. People</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p> <blockquote> <p>The writ of certiorari is not issued to correct every error that may have been committed by lower courts and tribunals. It is a remedy specifically to keep lower courts and tribunals within the bounds of their jurisdiction. In our judicial system, the writ is issued to prevent lower courts and tribunals from committing grave abuse of discretion in excess of their jurisdiction. Further, the writ requires that there is no appeal or other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to correct the error. Thus, certiorari may not be issued if the error can be the subject of an ordinary appeal. . . . </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> An essential requisite for filing a petition for certiorari is the allegation that the judicial tribunal acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Grave abuse of discretion has been defined as a "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment that is patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Cruz</i>, the petitioners filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Certiorari assailing the Regional Trial Court Order. The trial court denied their Motion to release cash bond after the case was dismissed due to the private complainant's desistance. The Court of Appeals eventually dismissed the Petition on the ground that it was an improper remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></p> <p> There, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals Decision and ruled that the Regional Trial Court's noncompliance with the Rules of Court constituted grave abuse of discretion, the proper remedy against which is a petition for certiorari under Rules 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p> <p> Similarly, here, the Municipal Trial Court in Cities committed grave abuse of discretion in blatantly disregarding the clear wording of A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC, or the Judicial Affidavit Rule. The Rule is explicit: the prosecution is mandated to submit the judicial affidavits of its witnesses not later than five (5) days before pre-trial. Should they fail to submit them within the time prescribed, they shall be deemed to have waived their submission. Section 9 of the Judicial Affidavit Rule provides: </p> <blockquote> <p> SECTION 9. Application of Rule to Criminal Actions. — (a) This rule shall apply to all criminal actions: </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> (b) <i>The prosecution shall submit the judicial affidavits of its witnesses not later than five days before the pre-trial, serving copies of the same upon the accused</i>. The complainant or public prosecutor shall attach to the affidavits such documentary or object evidence as he may have marking them as Exhibits A, B, C, and so on. No further judicial affidavit, documentary, or object evidence shall be admitted at the trial.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> SECTION 10. Effect of Non-Compliance with the Judicial Affidavit Rule. — (a) <i>A party who fails to submit the required judicial affidavits and exhibits on time shall be deemed to have waived their submission</i>. The court may, however, allow only once the late submission of the same provided, the delay is for a valid reason, would not unduly prejudice the opposing party, and the defaulting party pays a fine of not less than P1,000.00 nor more than P5,000.00, at the discretion of the court. </p> </blockquote> <p> Nevertheless, if the belated submission of judicial affidavits has a valid reason, the court may allow the delay once as long as it "would not unduly prejudice the opposing party, and the defaulting party pays a fine of not less than P1,000.00 nor more than P5,000.00, at the discretion of the court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p> <p> Here, the Municipal Trial Court in Cities allowed the prosecution's belated submission of their Judicial Affidavits despite the repeated postponements of the scheduled pre-trial. To recall, the pre-trial was reset thrice: from August 12, 2013 to September 5, 2013, then to October 17, 2013, and finally, to November 21, 2013. In spite of that, the prosecution failed to submit their Judicial Affidavits within the time prescribed by the Rule. Its excuse— "for whatever reason"— cannot be considered sufficient to allow the belated submission of the Judicial Affidavits. </p> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
