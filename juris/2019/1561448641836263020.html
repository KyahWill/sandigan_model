				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Public prosecutors must address the different dimensions of complaints raised before them. When they provide well-reasoned resolutions on one (1) dimension, but overlook palpable indications that another crime has been committed, they fail to responsibly discharge the functions entrusted to them. This amounts to an evasion of positive duty, an act of grave abuse of discretion correctible by certiorari. <p> This resolves a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, praying that the assailed April 23, 2013 Consolidated Evaluation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and November 25, 2013 Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> issued in OMB-V-C-13-0098 by public respondent Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas be set aside for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.</p><p> In its assailed Consolidated Evaluation Report, the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas dismissed the Criminal Complaint for falsification (as penalized under Article 171<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code) and violation of Section 3(e)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, filed by petitioner Maria Shiela Hubahib Tupaz (Tupaz) against private respondents Fernando M.

Since its issuance in 1971, she added, a duplicate has always been in the possession of their family—initially by Hubahib and, upon her demise, by her heirs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p>On April 17, 2011, Atty. Abella canceled Original Certificate of Title No. 15609 and, in its stead, issued Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 116-2011000073 and 116-2011000074 in favor of Genaro Espiña (Genaro), represented by his attorney-in-fact, Macrina.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> According to Tupaz, this cancellation was anchored on the following: </p><ol><li> A document labeled as the owner's duplicate of Original Certificate of Title No. 15609 but which Tupaz argued was "materially and essentially different"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> from the copy on file with the Register of Deeds and the genuine owner's duplicate copy in her family's custody;<br><br></li><li> A Certificate Authorizing Registration supposedly issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, which indicated that no capital gains tax was paid despite the property being a more than 100,000- square meter commercial land with zonal valuation of P400.00 per square meter as of 2002. The same certificate indicated that only P2,655.00 in documentary stamp taxes and P100.00 for the certification fee were paid;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]<br><br></sup></li><li>A 1972 Deed of Conveyance, which was never annotated onto Original Certificate of Title No. 15609, and which had surfaced only in 2011, bearing a forgery of Hubahib's signature;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and<br><br></li><li> A subdivision plan that was made without the participation of or notice to Tupaz or her co-heirs/owners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></li></ol> <p> Tupaz maintained that Atty. Abella: (1) issued a spurious owner's duplicate copy of Original Certificate of Title No. 15609;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (2) tolerated the use of an equally spurious Certificate Authorizing Registration and Deed of Conveyance;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and (3) enabled the issuance of specious transfer certificates of titles, with Genaro as beneficiary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Hence, she filed her Complaint, asserting that Atty. Abella, along with Macrina, were liable for falsification, graft and corrupt practices, misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.</p><p> Tupaz's Complaint was docketed as OMB-V-C-13-0098 for the criminal aspect concerning falsification and graft and corrupt practices, and OMB-V-A-13-0100 for the administrative aspect concerning misconduct, dishonesty, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> In its assailed April 23, 2013 Consolidated Evaluation Report,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas dismissed Tupaz's Complaint for being "premature"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and declined to file criminal informations—both for falsification and graft and corrupt practices—against Atty. Abella and Macrina. It reasoned: </p><blockquote> <p> Upon scrutiny of the present complaint, it is found that the issue on the possible criminal liability of the respondents and the administrative liability of respondent ABELLA is closely intertwined with the issue on ownership of the subject property. It hinges on which party has the better right over the lot in question. If the transfer of the title of the property in favor of respondent ESPIÑA is upheld as valid, the present charges for falsification and dishonesty, etc. against the respondents would have no leg to stand on. Hence, the issue presented before this Office cannot be resolved without first touching on the overarching issue on ownership which is not within our jurisdiction to determine. This matter should be brought before the proper forum wherein questions regarding the transfer of title can be adjudicated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In its assailed November 25, 2013 Order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas denied Tupaz's Motion for Reconsideration. Maintaining that the Complaint was premature, it stated that Tupaz "has the option to again lodge the same complaint as long as the issue on ownership of the subject property has been settled by the proper court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p> <p> Thus, Tupaz filed this Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> specifically assailing the ruling of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas on the criminal aspect of her Complaint. While no longer making averments concerning Abella's and Macrina's liability for falsification, she maintains that they must both stand trial for violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p> <p> For resolution is the issue of whether or not public respondent Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in not finding probable cause to charge private respondent Fernando M. Abella, along with private respondent Macrina Espiña, with violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.</p> <p> This Court grants the Petition. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Probable cause for the filing of an information is "a matter which rests on likelihood rather than on certainty. It relies on common sense rather than on 'clear and convincing evidence.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In <i>Ampil v. Office of the Ombudsman:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> We likewise stress that the determination of probable cause does not require certainty of guilt for a crime. As the term itself implies, probable cause is concerned merely with probability and not absolute or even moral certainty; it is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. It is sufficient that based on the preliminary investigation conducted, it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged. Well-settled in jurisprudence, as in<em> Raro v. Sandiganbayan</em>, that:</p> <blockquote> <p> . . . [P]robable cause has been defined as the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief, in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted. </p> <p> Probable cause is a reasonable ground for presuming that a matter is or may be well-founded on such state of facts in the prosecutor's mind as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe — or entertain an honest or strong suspicion — that it is so. </p> </blockquote> <p> A finding of probable cause needs only to rest on evidence showing that more likely than not a crime has been committed and there is enough reason to believe that it was committed by the accused. It need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt, neither on evidence establishing absolute certainty of guilt. </p> <p> A finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction. It is enough that it is believed that the act or omission complained of constitutes the offense charged. Precisely, there is a trial for the reception of evidence of the prosecution in support of the charge. </p> <p> A finding of probable cause merely binds over the suspect to stand trial. It is not a pronouncement of guilt. </p> <blockquote> <p> The term does not mean "actual and positive cause" nor does it import absolute certainty. It is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. . . . Probable cause does not require an inquiry into whether there is sufficient evidence to procure a conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The determination of probable cause is an executive, not a judicial, function. It is generally not for a court to disturb the conclusion made by a public prosecutor. This is grounded on the basic principle of separation of powers. However, "grave abuse of discretion taints a public prosecutor's resolution if he [or she] arbitrarily disregards the jurisprudential parameters of probable cause."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In such cases, consistent with the principle of checks and balances among the three (3) branches of government, a writ of certiorari may be issued to undo the prosecutor's iniquitous determination. In <i>Lim v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> As a general rule, a public prosecutor's determination of probable cause — that is, one made for the purpose of filing an Information in court — is essentially an executive function and, therefore, generally lies beyond the pale of judicial scrutiny. The exception to this rule is when such determination is tainted with grave abuse of discretion and perforce becomes correctible through the extraordinary writ of certiorari. The rationale behind the general rule rests on the principle of separation of powers, dictating that the determination of probable cause for the purpose of indicting a suspect is properly an executive function, while the exception hinges on the limiting principle of checks and balances, whereby the judiciary, through a special civil action of certiorari, has been tasked by the present Constitution to determine whether or not grave abuse of discretion has been committed amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. It is fundamental that the concept of grave abuse of discretion transcends mere judgmental error as it properly pertains to a jurisdictional aberration. <em>While defying precise definition, grave abuse of discretion generally refers to a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Corollarily, the abuse of discretion must be patent and gross so as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law. </em>To note, the underlying principle behind the courts' power to review a public prosecutor's determination of probable cause is to ensure that the latter acts within the permissible bounds of his authority or does not gravely abuse the same. This manner of judicial review is a constitutionally-enshrined form of check and balance which underpins the very core of our system of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> Assessing the evidence before them, public prosecutors are vested "with a wide range of discretion, the discretion of whether, what and whom to charge[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As such, "[t]he prosecuting attorney cannot be compelled to file a particular criminal information."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p>Public prosecutors are not bound to adhere to a party's apparent determination of the specific crime for which a person shall stand trial. Their discretion "include[s] the right to determine under which laws prosecution will be pursued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, in <i>Uy v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the petitioner's indictment and eventual conviction for estafa was sustained despite his protestations that "the private complainant's demand letter,. . . indicates that the demand was for alleged violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> In keeping with the basic precept of judicial non-interference, "not even the Supreme Court can order the prosecution of a person against whom the prosecutor does not find sufficient evidence to support at least a <em>prima facie</em> case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In <em>People v. Pineda</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this Court sustained the public prosecutor and issued a writ of certiorari, invalidating the orders of Court of First Instance Judge Hernando Pineda, which compelled the prosecutor to drop four (4) out of the five (5) cases which the prosecutor had filed since, according to Judge Pineda, "the acts complained of 'stemmed out of a series of continuing acts on the part of the accused, not by different and separate sets of shots, moved by one impulse and should therefore be treated as one crime to the series of shots killed more than one victim[.]'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In ruling against judicial overreach, this Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> 3. The impact of respondent Judge's orders is that his judgment is to be substituted for that of the prosecutor's on the matter of what crime is to be filed in court. The question of instituting a criminal charge is one addressed to the sound discretion of the investigating Fiscal. The information he lodges in court must have to be supported by facts brought about by an inquiry made by him. It stands to reason then to say that in a clash of views between the judge who did not investigate and the fiscal who did, or between the fiscal and the offended party or the defendant, those of the Fiscal's should normally prevail. In this regard, he cannot ordinarily be subject to dictation. We are not to be understood as saying that criminal prosecution may not be blocked in exceptional cases. A relief in equity "may be availed of to stop a purported enforcement of criminal law where it is necessary (a) for the orderly administration of justice; (b) to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner; (c) to avoid multiplicity of actions; (d) to afford adequate protection to constitutional rights; and (e) in proper cases, because the statute relied upon is unconstitutional or was 'held invalid.'" Nothing in the record would as much as intimate that the present case fits into any of the situations just recited.</p> <p> And at this distance and in the absence of any compelling fact or circumstance, we are loathe to tag the City Fiscal of Iligan City with abuse of discretion in filing separate cases for murder and frustrated murder, instead of a single case for the complex crime of robbery with homicide and frustrated homicide under the provisions of Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code or, for that matter, for multiple murder and frustrated murder. We state that, here, the Fiscal's discretion should not be controlled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> When, however, "there is an unmistakable showing of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the prosecutor"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> in declining to prosecute specific persons for specific offenses, a writ of certiorari may be issued to set aside the prosecutor's initial determination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Chua v. Padillo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this Court sustained the Court of Appeals in granting the respondents' Petition for Certiorari and in ordering the inclusion of the petitioners-siblings Wilson and Renita Chua as accused, along with Wilson's wife, Marissa Padillo-Chua, in a case of estafa through falsification of commercial documents. </p><p> In <i>Marasigan v. Fuentes</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> this Court reversed the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the private complainant's Petition for Certiorari. It found that it was "grave abuse of discretion for [Department of Justice] Secretary [Agnes VST] Devanadera to conclude that respondent [Robert] Calilan may only be prosecuted for the crime of less serious physical injuries while his co-respondents, [Reginald] Fuentes and [Alain Delon] Lindo, may not be prosecuted at all."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Accordingly, this Court reinstated the previous Resolution issued by Undersecretary Linda Malenab-Hornilla, which "ordered the provincial prosecutor of Laguna to file informations for attempted murder against Fuentes, Calilan, and Lindo."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> <i>Reynes v. Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> concerned prosecution for illegal exactions as penalized under Article 213(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This Court found grave abuse of discretion on the part of a graft investigation and prosecution officer who, in evaluating proof that the private respondents collected sums which had precisely been alleged by the complainant to lack legal basis, faulted the same complainant for failing to present an ordinance as proof that the amounts received were "different. . . than those authorized by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This Court set aside the Resolution and Order of the Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas) and directed the filing of an information against one (1) of the private respondents.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Determining probable cause must be made in reference to the elements of the crime charged. "This is based on the principle that every crime is defined by its elements, without which there should be, at the most, no criminal offense."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> Appraising probable cause for a violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act must begin with the text of Section 3(e): </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 3. Corrupt practices of public officers.— In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful: </p> <blockquote> <p>. . . .</p> <p>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, a violation of Section 3(e) is deemed to have occurred when the following elements are demonstrated: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">the offender is a public officer; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">the act was done in the discharge of the public officer's official, administrative or judicial functions;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The third element identifies three (3) distinct modes of commission: manifest partiality, evident bad faith, and gross inexcusable negligence. <em>Fonacier v. Sandiganbayan</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> distinguished these modes, as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> "Partiality" is synonymous with "bias" which "excites a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are." "Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud." "Gross negligence has been so defined as negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wil[l]fully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their own property." These definitions prove all too well that the three modes are distinct and different from each other. Proof of the existence of any of these modes in connection with the prohibited acts under Section 3(e) should suffice to warrant conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The fourth element identifies two (2) alternative, typifying effects: causing undue injury to any party and/or giving any private party unwarranted benefit, advantage, or preference. Prosecution and/or conviction under Section 3(e) ensues when either or both of these are occasioned by the public officer's manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]here are two ways by which Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 may be violated — the first, by causing undue injury to any party, including the government, or the second, by giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. Although neither mode constitutes a distinct offense, an accused may be charged under either mode or both. The use of the disjunctive "or" connotes that the two modes need not be present at the same time. In other words, the presence of one would suffice for conviction. </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> The word "unwarranted" means lacking adequate or official support; unjustified; unauthorized or without justification or adequate reason. "Advantage" means a more favorable or improved position or condition; benefit, profit or gain of any kind; benefit from some course of action. "Preference" signifies priority or higher evaluation or desirability; choice or estimation above another. </p> <p> In order to be found guilty under the second mode, it suffices that the accused has given unjustified favor or benefit to another, in the exercise of his official, administrative or judicial functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> This case is not unique. In the past, this Court has overturned the Office of the Ombudsman's resolution not finding probable cause in criminal complaints concerning titles whose issuance was allegedly occasioned by falsification perpetrated by a registrar of deeds who may have violated Section 3(e). </p><p> In<i> Ampil</i>, petitioner Oscar R. Ampil filed a Complaint charging the private respondents—among them, Pasig City Registrar of Deeds Policarpio L. Espenesin (Espenesin)—with Falsification of Public Documents under Article 171(6) of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Section 3 (a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and (e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. His Complaint arose from Espenesin's issuance of a second set of condominium certificates of title indicating Malayan Insurance Company (Malayan Insurance) as the owner of 38 condominium units in the Malayan Tower. This was despite his own prior issuance of condominium certificates of title over the same units in the name of ASB Realty Corporation (ASB Realty), and despite ASB Realty allegedly being entitled to those units pursuant to a memorandum of agreement between ASB Realty and Malayan Insurance. </p><p> The Office of the Ombudsman dismissed Ampil's Complaint, as in this case, for being supposedly premature considering that the issue of ownership between ASB Realty and Malayan Insurance had yet to be settled. As summarized by this Court: </p><blockquote> <p> For the Ombudsman, the resolution of whether respondents falsified the CCTs must be prefaced by a determination of who, between MICO and ASB, is the rightful owner of the subject units. The Ombudsman held that it had no authority to interpret the provisions of the [Memorandum of Agreement] and, thus, refrained from resolving the preliminary question of ownership. Given the foregoing, the Ombudsman was hard pressed to make a categorical finding that the CCTs were altered to speak something false. In short, the Ombudsman did not have probable cause to indict respondents for falsification of the CCTs because the last element of the crime, <i>i.e</i>., that the change made the document speak something false, had not been established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> However, as to the charge of graft and corruption under Section 3(a) and (e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, this Court noted that "the Ombudsman did not dispose of whether probable cause exists to indict respondents for violation of Section 3(a) and (e) of Republic Act No. 3019."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> This Court conceded that the charge of falsification cannot prosper. Nonetheless, it faulted the Office of the Ombudsman for failing to address the charges of graft and corruption: </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he Ombudsman abruptly dismissed Ampil's complaint-affidavit, resolving only one of the charges contained therein with nary a link regarding the other charge of violation of Sections 3 (a) and (e) of Republic Act No. 3019. Indeed, as found by the Ombudsman, the 4th element of the crime of Falsification of Public Documents is lacking, as the actual ownership of the subject units at The Malayan Tower has yet to be resolved. <em>Nonetheless, this circumstance does not detract from, much less diminish, Ampil's charge, and the evidence pointing to the possible commission, of offenses under Sections 3 (a) and (e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court then proceeded to explain that a <em>prima facie</em> case for violating Section 3(e) existed against Espenesin and his co-respondent, Francis Serrano, the lawyer with whom Espenesin had grown familiar for previously liaising with his office on behalf of ASB and Malayan Insurance.

Here, the evidence strongly suggests that private respondent Abella's actions, like Espenesin's, fell miserably short of the standards apropos to his office. While he did not act with private respondent Macrina out of a shared malevolent design, he nonetheless relied on manifestly defective and tellingly suspicious documents that private respondent Macrina (or persons acting under and for her) presented. </p><p> Hence, as with <i>Ampil</i>, where this Court maintained that criminal informations must be filed against the grossly erring registrar of deeds and the private person at whose urging he performed his errant official acts, private respondents must stand trial for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p> From the evidence adduced by petitioner, there is basis to maintain a reasonable belief that private respondent Abella enabled the cancellation of the Original Certificate of Title and issuance of new transfer certificates of title. This was despite manifest and unequivocal deficiencies, most notably in the owner's duplicate copy, the Certificate Authorizing Registration, and the Deed of Conveyance that had been presented to him. </p><p> Private respondent Abella admitted canceling Original Certificate of Title No. 15609 after he was presented an owner's duplicate that "consists of only two pages which is somewhat defaced/torn."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In contrast, the original copy, which was on file in his own office, consisted of four (4) pages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> Not only did the duplicate presented to him<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> not correspond with the original on file; it was also severely mutilated, with the effect—rather curiously—that identifying features could no longer be perused. As pointed out by petitioner, "[a]ll possible markings of the nature and origin"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of the alleged owner's duplicate were torn off: (1) the serial number of the page in the registry book in which the title is recorded; (2) the free patent number;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (3) the lot number;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (4) the signature of the Survey Division chief who attested to the technical description;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> and (5) the signature of the "person who verified or checked the technical description[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </p><p> It is not just that these were missing.

Most glaringly, as petitioner points out, it was dated 2011 and referred to a 1972 Deed of Conveyance. Despite this, the certificate did not indicate even the slightest charge or penalty for delayed payment of taxes occasioned by the transfer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Similarly, it indicated that no capital gains tax was due and that only P2,655.00 in documentary stamps taxes and P100.00 as certificate fee were paid. This, despite how the commercial property encompassed 100,691 square meters, was located along a provincial road and, as of 2002, had its zonal value fixed at P400.00 per square meter, or a total of P40,276,400.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p> <p> Petitioner also pointed out that the Deed of Conveyance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> though dated 1972, was presented for registration only after 39 years and only after the death of Hubahib, the purported seller.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><p> None of the plethora of deficiencies across several documents has been disavowed by any of the respondents.

However, she did not specifically address any of the deficiencies noted by petitioner. </p><p> As things stand, the evidence weighs far more heavily in favor of petitioner's cause. Even granting that he did not act with a deliberately malevolent design, he still appears to have acted with grossly inexcusable negligence that he practically evaded his duties as a registrar of deeds. Private respondent Abella was equipped with skills and training to identify irregularities in property registration. More important, it was his solemn duty to not facilitate registrations attended by manifest aberrations. The palpable defects of the documents presented to him should have prompted him to desist with the cancellation of the Original Certificate of Title. Instead, he went so far as to issue new transfer certificates of title. In so doing, he caused undue injury to Hubahib's heirs and extended unwarranted benefits to Genaro.

The Register of Deeds shall thereafter make out in the registration book a new certificate of title to the grantee and shall prepare and deliver to him an owner's duplicate certificate. The Register of Deeds shall note upon the original and duplicate certificate the date of transfer, the volume and page of the registration book in which the new certificate is registered and a reference by number to the last preceding certificate. The original and the owner's duplicate of the grantor's certificate shall be stamped "cancelled". The deed of conveyance shall be filed and indorsed with the number and the place of registration of the certificate of title of the land conveyed. <br> . . . . </p> <p> SECTION 108. Amendment and Alteration of Certificates. — No erasure, alteration, or amendment shall be made upon the registration book after the entry of a certificate of title or of a memorandum thereon and the attestation of the same by the Register of Deeds, except by order of the proper Court of First Instance. A registered owner or other person having an interest in registered property, or, in proper cases, the Register of Deeds with the approval of the Commissioner of Land Registration, may apply by petition to the court upon the ground that the registered interests of any description, whether vested, contingent, expectant or inchoate appearing on the certificate, have terminated and ceased; or that new interest not appearing upon the certificate have arisen or been created; or that an omission or error was made in entering a certificate or any memorandum thereon, or on any duplicate certificate; or that the same or any person on the certificate has been changed; or that the registered owner has married, or, if registered as married, that the marriage has been terminated and no right or interests of heirs or creditors will thereby be affected; or that a corporation which owned registered land and has been dissolved has not conveyed the same within three years after its dissolution; or upon any other reasonable ground; and the court may hear and determine the petition after notice to all parties in interest, and may order the entry or cancellation of a new certificate, the entry or cancellation of a memorandum upon a certificate, or grant any other relief upon such terms and conditions, requiring security or bond if necessary, as it may consider proper; Provided, however, That this section shall not be construed to give the court authority to reopen the judgment or decree of registration, and that nothing shall be done or ordered by the court which shall impair the title or other interest of a purchaser holding a certificate for value and in good faith, or his heirs and assigns, without his or their written consent. Where the owner's duplicate certificate is not presented, a similar petition may be filed as provided in the preceding section. </p> <p> All petitions or motions filed under this Section as well as under any other provision of this Decree after original registration shall be filed and entitled in the original case in which the decree or registration was entered.</p> </blockquote> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> <i>Ampil v.
