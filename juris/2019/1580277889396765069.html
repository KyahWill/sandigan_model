Three (3) days later, she voluntarily went to her grandfather's house which was closer to the house of her other aunt CCC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Complainant's physical and behavioral changes, including her frequent headache and stomach ache aroused her aunts' suspicion. Then CCC learned complainant had missed her menstrual period, CCC caused complainant to take a pregnancy test which yielded a positive result.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> When asked who the father of her child was and who molested her, complainant motioned the name "Dante," herein appellant. She then charged appellant with rape before the XXX Police Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>With the assistance of sign language interpreters Joshua Asuela, Jr. and Roygie Gantalao, complainant testified that sometime in September 2007, while she was studying inside her dormitory room, appellant entered her room, undressed her, touched her body, and inserted his penis in her vagina. She pushed appellant, but it was in vain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The incident was repeated several times, specifically on September 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28, 2007; October 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, 2007 November 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, 2007; December 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, 2007; and January 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, 2008.

He admitted he had sexual congress with complainant for more than forty-four (44) times but asserted they were all consensual. Complainant filed the rape charges only because her pregnancy and illicit affair with him brought embarrassment to her family.<br><br>On February 27, 2007, he got employed as watchman of XXX SPED School and Dormitory in XXX Elementary School. He worked from 7:30 in the evening until 4:30 in the morning and resided in the school dormitory. His wife also worked and resided in the SPED dormitory as caretaker tasked to look after the blind students. He met complainant on the same day he got employed. She and her friend EEE frequently roamed around the school premises and visited him in his post at night. Complainant communicated with him through sign language which EEE, a polio victim with no hearing impairment, would interpret to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On February 28, 2007, complainant spoke signs to appellant. EEE said complainant was telling him he was handsome and she liked him. He knew complainant liked him because she even wrote him a letter which his wife had torn. Complainant told him she wanted them to be friends even after he confided to her he was already married. They had since become lovers. Complainant visited him in his post every night. She became close to him and even gave him a stuff toy, watch, and a photo of them together with dedication at the back.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On October 3, 2007, complainant went to his sleeping quarters and gave him a watch and a stuff toy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Because of the heavy rains that night, his companion who occupied the quarters with him did not arrive. He told complainant to go home but the latter refused and even slept beside him. Complainant pinched him, then they started kissing, tickling, and hugging each other. They eventually had sexual intercourse. Complainant never resisted but consented to everything they did. She even sucked his lips when he inserted his sex organ into hers. After October 3, 2007, they had many more nights of sexual congress in his quarters, all with complainant's full consent. Complainant was already of legal age when they started having sexual intercourse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He had sexual intercourse with complainant more than forty-four (44) times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> EEE and his wife's male cousin named Rey knew about his sexual congress with complainant as they, too, were lovers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Complainant charged him with rape only because her aunt BBB had threatened her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The defense offered in evidence the stuff toy (Exhibit "1"); a ladies' watch (Exhibit "2"); and a picture (Exhibit "3").<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>The Trial Court's Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>By Joint Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated January 30, 2013, the trial court found appellant guilty of forty-four (44) counts of rape, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises above considered, the court finds DANTE CUB AY y Ugsalan GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of rape of AAA for 44 counts and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty each of RECLUSION PERPETUA in Criminal Case Numbers 08-05-3536 up to Criminal Case No. 08-05-3579 and he is further ordered:<br><br>A - To pay AAA -<br><ol><li>Civil Indemnity - Php 75,000.00 each for forty-four counts of rape aforementioned;<br><br></li><li>Moral Damages - Php 50,000.00 each for 44 counts of rape aforementioned;<br><br></li><li>Exemplary damages - Php 25,000.00 each for forty- four counts of rape aforementioned;<br></li></ol>B - In every case -<br><ol start="4"><li>Recognition of the child of AAA;<br><br></li><li>To support the offspring of AAA; and<br></li></ol>C -<br><ol start="6"><li>Pay the costs.</li></ol>Accused is credited (for) his preventive detention at the PDRC-Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon, and the remainder of his penalties shall be served at the Davao Prison and Penal Farm, B.E.

Appellant essentially argued: (1) Complainant's testimony did not deserve credence as it was uncorroborated, implausible, and replete with inconsistencies. More, complainant's testimony was only conveyed to the court by sign language interpreters who were engaged by complainant's family and who appeared biased in favor of the prosecution. (2) The trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to propound leading questions on complainant. (3) There was no rape because his sexual congress with complainant was consensual, they being lovers. Although complainant had impaired hearing, she was capable of giving consent to the sexual intercourse. She was already eighteen (18) years old during all their forty-four (44) sexual encounters. She had normal mental faculties during all those times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), through State Solicitor Alberto T. Talampas maintained that the prosecution was able to prove to a moral certainty that appellant had carnal knowledge of complainant for forty-four (44) times through force, threat, or intimidation. Her consistent and positive identification of appellant as the man who raped her prevails over appellant's self-serving denial and uncorroborated sweetheart theory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></u><br></center><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated November 24, 2015, the Court of Appeals affirmed.<br><br><center><u><b>The Present Appeal</b></u><br></center><br>Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for his acquittal. In compliance with Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated July 13, 2016, both appellant and the OSG manifested<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that, in lieu of supplemental briefs, they were adopting their respective briefs before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><center><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></center><br>Did the Information validly charge the crime of rape?<br><br>Assuming the affirmative, was the prosecution able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the forty-four (44) counts of rape?<br><br><center><u><b>Ruling</b></u><br></center><br><b><i>The Informations do not charge the crime of rape.</i></b><br><br>The principal purpose of an Information is to ensure that the accused is formally informed of the facts and acts constituting the offense charged<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> in accordance with the rights of the accused enshrined in the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Toward this end, the Rules of Court requires that the Information clearly accurately allege every element of the offense charged. Section 6, Rule 110 pertinently provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 6.</b> <i>Sufficiency of complaint or information.</i> - A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused, the designation of the offense by the statute, <b>the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense</b>; the name of the offended party; the approximate time of the commission of the offense, and the place wherein the offense was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Where the Information is insufficient, it cannot be the basis of any valid conviction. <b><i>Quimvel v. People of the Philippines</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> decrees:<br><blockquote>The main purpose of requiring the elements of a crime to be set out in the Information is to enable the accused to suitably prepare his defense because he is presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. <b>The allegations of facts constituting the offense charged are substantial matters and the right of an accused to question his conviction based on facts not alleged in the information cannot be waived.</b> As further explained in <i>Andaya v. People</i>:<br><blockquote><b>No matter how conclusive and convincing the evidence of guilt may be, an accused cannot be convicted of any offense unless it is charged in the information on which he is tried or is necessarily included therein.</b> To convict him of a ground not alleged while he is concentrating his defense against the ground alleged would plainly be unfair and underhanded. The rule is that a variance between the allegation in the information and proof adduced during trial shall be fatal to the criminal case if it is material and prejudicial to the accused so much so that it affects his substantial rights. (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Here, appellant was charged with forty-four (44) counts of rape. The elements of rape are as follows: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) the offender accomplished such act through force or intimidation, or when the victim was deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or when she was under twelve (12) years of age or was demented.<br><br>We quote anew the forty-four (44) separate Informations, which except for the material dates, uniformly read:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 7<sup>th</sup> day of September, 2007, in the evening, at XXX, province of Bukidnon, Philippines particularly at the Special Education Dormitory (SPED) and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with [AAA], (an) 18 year-old (who) suffered (a) physical defect (hearing impaired) against her will, to the damage and prejudice of [AAA] in such amount as (may be) allowed by law.<br><br>CONTRARY to (and) in violation of R.A. 8353.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>The Informations conspicuously lack the second element of rape, <i>i.e.</i> the accused employed force or intimidation, or that the victim was deprived of reason, unconscious, under twelve (12) years of age, or was demented.<br><br>Surely, being a deaf-mute does not necessarily take the place of the element of force or intimidation or having been deprived of reason, unconscious, or demented. The allegation that "the accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with AAA, an 18 year-old (who) suffered a physical defect (hearing impaired) against her will, xxx" does not equate to force or intimidation either.<br><br>In fine, the Informations do not validly charge the crime of rape or any offense at all. The same, for sure, cannot be the basis of a valid judgment of conviction.<br><br>We are not unmindful of the rule that by his plea, an accused is deemed to have waived all objections to the information. This rule, however, is correct only insofar as formal objections to the pleadings are concerned. By express provision of Section 9, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court and by established jurisprudence, the validity of the Information <i>vis-a-vis</i> the essential issue of whether or not it sufficiently charges an offense goes into the very foundation of jurisdiction, hence, may be raised and addressed at any stage of the proceedings. Sections 9 and 3 of Rule 117 relevantly provide:<br><blockquote>Sec. 9. <i>Failure to move to quash or to allege any ground therefor</i>. - The failure of the accused to assert any ground of a motion to quash before he pleads to the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash or failed to allege the same in said motion, <b>shall be deemed a waiver of any objections except those based on the grounds provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (g), and (i) of Section 3 of this Rule</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Sec. 3. <i>Grounds</i>. - The accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any of the following grounds:<br><br>(a) <b>That the facts charged do not constitute an offense;</b><br><br>(b) That the court trying the case has no jurisdiction over the offense charged;<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(g) That the criminal action or liability has been extinguished; and<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(i) That the accused has been previously convicted or acquitted of the offense charged, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In some cases, the Court considered the omission of the essential element of "force or intimidation" to be non-fatal in view of its recital in the complaint itself which at any rate formed part of the Information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>But this is not the case here. Both the Information and Complaint did not allege the essential element of "force or intimidation," specifically, that the accused employed force or intimidation, or that the victim was deprived of reason, unconscious, under twelve (12) years of age, or was demented. For easy reference, the Complaint reads, thus:<br><blockquote>The undersigned offended party, hereby accuses Dante U. Cubay, 40 years old, married a caretaker of XXX Central School, a resident of XXX, Bukidnon for the crime of RAPE, committed as follows, to wit:<br><blockquote>That every ten (o'clock) in the evening during school days of September 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 2007, October 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 2007, November 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 2007, December 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2007 and January 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2008 at SPED Dormitory, XXX, Province of Bukidnon, Philippines and within the (jurisdiction) of this Honorable Office of the Department of Justice, the (above-named) accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully, maliciously intend and with lewd desire rape the minor who is a hearing impaired and had given her money and other things thus sex was not freely given.<br></blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW, under ART. 335 of the RPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>To repeat, an Information which does not sufficiently charge an offense is fatally defective and warrants the acquittal of the accused.<br><br><b><i>Guelos v. People</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> explains the significance of the propriety and sufficiency of the charge made in the information, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>In <i>People v. Flores, Jr.</i>, as reiterated in the more recent cases of <i>People v. Pangilinan</i> and <i>People v. Dadulla</i>, the Court ruled that the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him cannot be waived for reasons of public policy. Hence, it is imperative that the complaint or information filed against the accused be complete to meet its objectives. As such, an indictment <i>must fully state the elements of the specific offense</i> alleged to have been committed. <b>For an accused cannot be convicted of an offense, even if duly proven, unless it is alleged or necessarily included in the complaint or information.</b> In other words, the complaint must contain a specific allegation of every fact and circumstance necessary to constitute the crime charged, the accused being presumed to have no independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. <b>Under Section 9 of Rule 117 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, an accused's failure to raise an objection to the insufficiency or defect in the information would not amount to a waiver of any objection based on said ground or irregularity.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>So must it be.<br><br><b><i>The elements of rape were not established</i></b><br><br>Even assuming the Informations validly charged the crime of rape, a verdict of acquittal here is still in order.<br><br>In convicting appellant of forty-four (44) counts of rape, the trial court and the Court of Appeals mainly relied on complainant's testimony on direct and cross. The full text of her testimony reads:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Do you recall what did Dante do to you?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes Dante entered my room and I was raped by Dante.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Where did this happen?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">In the room in the dormitory where I was sleeping.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">When you said rape, what do you mean by that?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Undressed, touched my body and then I pushed him, I was afraid.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">You mean he inserted his penis to your vagina? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Now, if you can recall, how many times did he rape you? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">September, October, November, December and January.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">And do you recall if these incidents of rape happened during school days?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The thing speaks for itself. On the whole, AAA's testimony is noticeably terse, vague, equivocal, and seriously wanting in details pertaining to the presence of the essential element of force or intimidation. AAA's testimony only bears the element of carnal knowledge.<br><br>That AAA pushed appellant when he "undressed, touched my body. . ., I was afraid" is at best equivocal. Again, this hardly equates with "force or intimidation" within the penal provision defining and penalizing rape.<br><br>For one, the act of pushing did not emanate from appellant but from AAA. For another, "pushing" is equivocal subject to different interpretations depending on the attendant circumstances. It may mean a <i>gentle "no, " "not yet," "wait," "I am shy," "not here,"</i> and many more possible interpretations or meanings. One thing is sure though: under the attendant circumstances, it cannot be deemed sufficient proof of <i>resistance or unconsented sex</i>.<br><br>In any event, <b><i>People v. Tionloc</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> decrees that resistance must be <i>manifested and tenacious, viz</i>:<br><blockquote>In People v. Amogis this Court held that resistance must be manifested and tenacious. A mere attempt to resist is not the resistance required and expected of a woman defending her virtue, honor and chastity. And granting that it was sufficient, "AAA" should have done it earlier or the moment appellant's evil design became manifest. In other words, it would be unfair to convict a man of rape committed against a woman who, after giving him the impression thru her unexplainable silence of her tacit consent and allowing him to have sexual contact with her, changed her mind in the middle and charged him with rape.<br></blockquote><i>The short and long of it is this</i>: The evidence on record indubitably show that then eighteen (18) year old AAA, albeit she is a deaf-mute with low capacity to learn formal sign language, is in truth, mentally capable of giving or withholding consent.<br><br>For even though AAA is a deaf-mute and certified to be only at Grade 2 level in formal sign language education does not mean she is suffering from mental abnormality, deficiency, or retardation which has the effect of hindering her capacity to give consent. <b><i>People v. Butiong</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> elucidates:<br><blockquote>Carnal knowledge of the female with her consent is not rape, provided she is above the age of consent or is capable in the eyes of the law of giving consent. xxx<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp; xxx&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>In his commentary on the Revised Penal Code, Justice Aquino discusses the concept of committing rape against the female's will or without her consent, to wit:<br><br><center>xxx xxx&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>The deprivation of reason need not be complete. Mental abnormality or deficiency is enough. Cohabitation with a feebleminded, idiotic woman is rape.

On this score, We have consistently ruled that the victim's bare statement that the accused raped her again on the succeeding dates is a conclusion of law which cannot serve as sole basis for appellant's conviction. <b><i>People v. Nuyte</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> lucidly teaches:<br><blockquote>AAA's bare statements that appellant repeated what he had done on her previously were not enough to establish beyond reasonable doubt the incidents subject of Criminal Case Nos. FC-00-781, FC-00-784 and FC-00-785. Said declarations were mere general conclusions. The prosecution must endeavor to present in detailed fashion the manner by which each of the crimes was committed. "Every charge of rape is a separate and distinct crime and each must be proved beyond reasonable doubt." There is no reason why the foregoing principle should not be applied in the aforementioned cases. Prescinding therefrom, appellant should be acquitted in these cases.<br></blockquote>To emphasize, sexual intercourse here between appellant and AAA happened at least forty-four (44) times over only a period of five (5) months. And through all these times, AAA never complained. She did not even want to leave the dormitory where all her forty-four (44) sexual encounters with appellant happened. She was even seen by one of her teachers "eating snacks with appellant," hence her aunt BBB, also a SPED teacher, proposed to AAA's grandfather to pull AAA from the dormitory and make her live with her (BBB) because she did not want ugly rumors to spread.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Too, AAA testified she did not go with her grandfather the first time the latter came to pull her out from the dormitory because "he might scold her." For what? If we put it in context, it was because of the "ugly rumor spreading" about her and appellant.<br><br>Finally, AAA revealed the supposed rape (forty-four [44] counts altogether) only when her relatives discovered she was pregnant.<br><br>The foregoing circumstances taken singly or collectively, are exculpatory evidence which compel no less than a verdict of acquittal.<br><br>It is settled that in every criminal prosecution, the accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is established by the prosecution.

Moreover, to rely on the opinion that the complainant's "weak resistance" justified the unwarranted advances of accused-appellant should deserve the utmost disdain from this Court and has no place in our jurisprudence lest it encourage malicious elements to abuse and exploit more victims in the future.<br><br><i>The Information had sufficiently and substantially established all the elements of the crime of rape</i><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> postulates that the Information failed to state all the elements of the crime of rape, specifically that the accused-appellant employed force or intimidation, or that the victim was deprived of reason, unconscious, under 12 years of age, or was demented.<br><br>The separate Information charging accused-appellant with 44 counts of rape generally states the following, to wit:<br><blockquote>That on or about the (7<sup>th</sup> day of September, 2007), in the evening, at XXX, Province of Bukidnon, Philippines, particularly at the Special Education (SPED) Dormitory and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have [sic] sexual intercourse with [AAA], an 18-year-old but [sic] suffered a physical defect (hearing defect) <b>against her will</b>, to the damage and prejudice of [AAA] in such amount as may be allowed by law. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is well-established in our jurisprudence that the acts or omissions constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances alleged <b>must be stated in ordinary and concise language; they do not necessarily need to be in the language of the statute, and should be in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is charged and what qualifying and aggravating circumstance are alleged</b>, so that the court can pronounce judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The essence of rape is carnal knowledge of a female either <i>against her will</i> (through force or intimidation) or <i>without her consent</i> (where the female is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or is under 12 years of age, or is demented).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> There is nothing more concise and direct statement/description to allege that accused-appellant employed force or intimidation, or that the victim was deprived of reason, unconscious, under 12 years of age, or was demented, from that he had carnal knowledge with the complainant <b>against her will</b>. While the means or methods employed by the accused were not specifically described in the legal terms used by the law, it was sufficiently implied by the use of the phrase "<i>against her will</i>."<br><br>Furthermore, contrary to the assertions of the <i>ponencia</i>, it cannot be said that accused-appellant was not formally informed of the facts and the acts constituting the offense charged. The phrase "<i>against her will</i>" connotes deprivation of will or consent from the victim, as opposed to the defense of accused-appellant that his carnal knowledge of the former was mutual and with consent. The fact that he used the "sweetheart defense" necessarily means that he understood and denies the allegation that any sexual congress that occurred between him and the complainant was against her will or consent.<br><br><i>Any ground to quash an Information does not entitle the accused to an acquittal</i><br><br>Assuming arguendo that the Information lacks an element of the crime charged against the accused-appellant, Section 4, Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure clearly states that <b>if the ground based upon is that "the facts charged do not constitute an offense," the prosecution shall be given by the court an opportunity to correct the defect by amendment</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v.

Thus, by not allowing the prosecution to have the opportunity to amend the alleged defect in the Information during the trial stage and worse, to acquit the accused-appellant outright, effectively curtailed the State's right to due process.<br><br>In any event, any ground to sustain a motion to quash under Section 3, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court, except Section 3(g) and (i), is not a bar to another prosecution for the same offense<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and if in custody, the accused shall not be discharged unless admitted to bail, if allowed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, it is incorrect to order the acquittal of accused-appellant because it would serve as double jeopardy and therefore, bar any subsequent complaint or information to be filed against him for the same offense. The rules regarding the same are clear and there is no room for any other interpretation thereto.<br><br><i>The date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime</i><br><br>The ponencia finds that the prosecution has failed to establish the elements of the crime of rape. The majority faults the complainant for: 1) failing to testify the accurate dates when she was raped by accused-appellant; 2) the testimony of the complainant was "noticeably terse, vague, equivocal and seriously wanting in details pertaining to the presence of the essential element of force and intimidation;" and 3) failing to prove that her resistance was <i>manifested and tenacious</i>.<br><br>It is well-established that the date of commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Since human memory is fickle and prone to the stresses of emotion, accuracy in a testimonial account has never been used as a standard in testing the credibility of a witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> This is even truer in cases where the victim suffers from a disability which clearly prevents her from effectively communicating with another person, as is in the instant case.<br><br>Neither is the belated filing of the Information against accused-appellant relevant, as jurisprudence is replete with rulings that a rape victim's deferral in reporting the crime does not equate to falsification of the accusation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>It has been repeatedly ruled that "delay in reporting an incident of rape is not necessarily an indication that the charge is fabricated, particularly when the delay can be attributed to fear instilled by threats from one who exercises ascendancy over the victim."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The accused-appellant was the caretaker of the school dormitory where the complainant was residing. Under the context of "friendship," he gained the trust and goodwill of complainant in her vulnerable state. He had access to the complainant any time of the day, which was clearly shown when he went to her room, sent her roommate away and satisfied his lust against her will. The absence of force or intimidation during the subsequent times that he raped her gains no valuable significance considering that accused-appellant exerted a moral influence over the complainant, over which may substitute for actual physical violence and intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, to blame the victim for not raising the injustice that had happened to her immediately after her first ordeal to the proper authorities and allowing the perpetrator to continue with his vile advances would be absurd. Every person's reaction to a heinous act committed against his/her person, honor, liberty and/or property cannot be simply chalked up to mathematical statistics and logical drivel. One may instantly fling himself/herself against his/her attacker in righteous fury and seek immediate and just reparation for the damage done to his/her person and honor, while another may need a longer time to recover his/her sanity due the shock of the abuse, thus, committed against him/her and prefer to delay his/her retaliation against his/her tormentors. Only an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent God could tell how a rape victim should and would react after such harrowing and stressful situation. If even trained experts in this field have differing opinions on how the abused mind of a rape victim reacts after the fact, the Court should apply the same level of caution and not make any speculative judgments regarding when a rape victim should have been considered recovered enough to face his/her abuser/s privately, much less publicly in court.<br><br>As held in <i>People v. Ducay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> [t]he range of emotions shown by rape victims is yet to be captured even by the calculus. It is, thus, unrealistic to expect uniform reactions from rape victims. We have no standard form of behavior for all rape victims in the aftermath of their defilement, for people react differently to emotional stress.<br><br>Thus, the Court should only rely on the evidence presented before it and not engage in guesswork on how the complainant should have reacted or the decisions she should have taken after being subjected to a traumatizing event at the hands of her abuser. That kind of "what-ifs" scenario should be left to the unforgiving imagination of the victim herself and the Court should not allow guilt to compound with the already insufferable grief she is already experiencing at the present.<br><br><i>The refusal of the victim to the advances of the accused, no matter when and how it was employed, can never ripen to an assent to the same</i><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> opined that complainant's testimony attesting that she pushed accused-appellant away when he undressed her and touched her body, and that she was afraid when all of these were happening to her, "is at best equivocal" that is "subject to different interpretations depending on the attendant circumstances" and "hardly equates with force or intimidation within the penal provision defining and penalizing rape."<br><br>I strongly disagree.<br><br>This view should never be considered, much less accepted by the Court, as long as it still stands by its mandate to serve justice when it is due. It is incredible to consider the complainant's actions as anything but for accused-appellant to desist from satisfying his lust for her. It is not "a gentle 'no,' 'not yet,' 'wait,' 'I am shy' or 'not here.'" This is not a matter of coyness or bashfulness coming from complainant to entice or tempt accused-appellant to proceed with his sexual advances.<br><br><i>NO means NO.</i> NO can never be a YES under any circumstance or event whatsoever.
