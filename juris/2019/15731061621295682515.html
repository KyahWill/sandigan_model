				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 19, 2010 and the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 27, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 106051.<br><br>This case is rooted from a Complaint for Annulment of Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, Nullification of Extrajudicial Foreclosure Sale and Damages with Prayer for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary Injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> filed by the Garcia-Lipana Commodities, Inc. and TLL Realty and Management Corporation (respondents) against Bank of the Philippine Islands (petitioner).<br><br>Succinctly, respondents obtained several loans from petitioner, secured by real estate mortgage on 30 parcels of land with improvements. Respondents religiously paid its loan obligations until at some point, they defaulted. This prompted petitioner to initiate foreclosure proceedings on the mortgaged properties, which were later on sold at public auction to petitioner being the highest bidder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Averring lack of demand and irregularities in the foreclosure proceedings, respondents filed the above-said Complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated March 24, 2008, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos City, Bulacan, Branch 22, in Civil Case No. 130-M-2008 granted respondents' application for writ of preliminary injunction, enjoining petitioner from consolidating its ownership over and taking possession of the foreclosed properties, which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, it appearing that the acts complained of would be in violation of [respondents'] right and would work [injustice] to the [respondents] and so as not to render ineffectual whatever judgment may be issued in this case, the application for preliminary injunction is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. Let a Writ of Preliminary Injunction be issued enjoining [petitioner] x x x from procuring a writ of possession from the Court; the defendant Office of the Ex-Officio Sheriff of the [RTC] of Malolos City, Bulacan from entering the premises and taking possession of the subject properties; and defendant Register of Deeds for the [P]rovince of Bulacan (Meycauayan Branch) from consolidating title over the subject properties x x x in the name of [petitioner] x x x until further orders from this Court.<br><br>This Order shall be effective upon [respondents'] filing of a bond in the amount of Two Hundred Sixty[-]Nine Million One Hundred Eighteen Thousand Five Hundred Twenty[-]Three Pesos and 42/100 (P269,118,523.42) x x x to answer for any and all damages that [petitioner] may suffer by reason of the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the said Order was denied by the RTC in its August 26, 2008 Order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of all the foregoing, the Motion for Reconsideration and the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration filed by the [petitioner] are hereby <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br>Considering that [petitioner] already filed its Answer With Compulsory Counterclaim and [respondents] filed its Answer to Compulsory Counterclaims and Reply, all issues having been joined, the instant case is now ripe for pre-trial. The resolution of all other motions is hereby held in abeyance pending the pre-trial. The Order of this Court dated July 15, 2008 submitting all motions for resolution is hereby set aside. Set this case for pre-trial on October 10, 2008 at 8:30 in the morning.

Parties are enjoined to faithfully comply with their obligations as set forth in the said agreements. In view of the foregoing, the complaint of [respondents] dated February 25, 2008 against [petitioner] and all the counterclaims of [petitioner] against [respondents] dated March 28, 2008 are <b>DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE</b>.<br><br>Further, the Motion to Lift Annotation is hereby <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>. Accordingly, [t]he Registry of Deeds is hereby ordered to cancel the Notice of [<i>Lis Pendens</i>] inscribed on the following titles: x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Finally, after the cancellation of the <i>Lis Pendens</i>, [petitioner] is hereby allowed to consolidate the titles covering the subject properties in its name at the expense of [petitioner],<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents attached copies of said Compromise Agreement and Judgment Based on the Compromise Agreement in their Verified Manifestation and Motion, together with a copy of the Entry of Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated July 6, 2015.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated April 11, 2016, this Court required petitioner to comment on respondents' Verified Manifestation and Motion, which prays for the dismissal of the instant petition with prejudice in view of the finality of said Judgment Based on the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>In compliance with this Court's April 11, 2016 Resolution, petitioner filed its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated June 28, 2016, which states that it "interposes <u><b>no objection</b></u> to the <i>Verified Manifestation</i> and <i>Motion</i> of the [respondents herein praying for the dismissal of the case with prejudice."<br><br>In view, therefore, of the final and executory Judgment Based on the Compromise Agreement, which settled any and all claims of the parties against each other in relation to the Complaint before the court of origin, and considering respondents' manifestation and motion to dismiss the instant petition and petitioner's assent thereto, the case at bar has been rendered moot and academic. We find no more necessity and purpose in determining whether or not it was proper to enjoin petitioner to consolidate its ownership over the subject properties and to take possession thereof. Under the terms of the compromise, the respondents already agreed, with judicial <i>imprimatur</i>, to relinquish their rights over the subject properties in favor of petitioner. In turn, petitioner agreed to accept said properties and to release respondents from any and all liabilities arising from the loan obligation.<br><br>It is noteworthy that settlement of cases in court at any stage of the proceeding is not only authorized, but, in fact, encouraged in our jurisdiction;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and when a compromise agreement is given judicial approval, it becomes more than just a contract binding upon the parties, it is no less than a judgment on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Verily, there is no more actual substantial relief to which petitioner would be entitled and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition.<br><br>In <i>Peñafrancia Sugar Mill, Inc. v. Sugar Regulatory Administration</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court explained:<br><blockquote>A case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use. In such instance, there is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. <b>Courts generally decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness. This is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it cannot be enforced.</b> (Citation omitted, emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b> for being moot and academic.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, Senior Associate Justice, (Chairperson), Perlas-Bernabe</i>, and <i>Caguioa, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Gesmundo, J.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Additional member, per Raffle dated June 17, 20019, in lieu of Associate Justice Amy C.
