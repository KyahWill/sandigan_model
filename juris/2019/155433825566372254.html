				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative matter involves Steveril J. Jabonete, Jr. (Jabonete), Junior Process Server, Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Pontevedra, Negros Occidental.<p> The records of the Employees' Leave Division (ELD) of the Office of Administrative Services (OAS) – Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) show that Jabonete had an approved vacation and sick leave application until June 3, 2011. However, he has not reported back to work and has not submitted his Daily Time Record (DTR) since June 2011 up to the present. Neither has he submitted additional applications for leave. Thus, based on the records, Jabonete has been absent without official leave since June 6, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p><p> On February 28, 2012, the ELD sent Jabonete a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> directing him to submit his DTRs from June 6, 2011 up to said date; otherwise, his salaries would be recommended for withholding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><p> The ELD further sent a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated March 21, 2012 to Jabonete at his court station – MTC, Pontevedra, Negros Occidental – coursed through said court's Acting Presiding Judge George S. Patriarca (Judge Patriarca), reiterating the directive for the former to submit his DTRs from June 2011 up to said date, with a warning that continued non-compliance will constrain the Office to recommend that his name be dropped from the rolls.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p>On June 4, 2012, the ELD received a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated May 10, 2012 from Judge Patriarca, informing it that he has personally handed the March 21, 2012 letter to Jabonete.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> To date, the ELD has not received any compliance from Jabonete.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thus, his salaries and other benefits were withheld pursuant to memorandum WSB No. 3d-2012 dated March 21, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p>The OCA informed the Court of its findings based on the records of its different offices, namely: (<em>a</em>) Jabonete has no application for retirement; (<em>b</em>) he is still in the <em>plantilla</em> of court personnel, and thus, considered to be in active service; (<em>c</em>) no administrative case is pending against him; and (<em>d</em>) he is not an accountable officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> In its Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated July 24, 2018, the OCA recommended that: (<em>a</em>) Jabonete's name be dropped from the rolls effective June 6, 2011 for having been absent without official leave; (<em>b</em>) his position be declared vacant; and (<em>c</em>) he be informed of his separation from the service at Barangay RSB, La Carlota, Negros Occidental, his last known address appearing in his 201 file. The OCA added, however, that Jabonete is still qualified to receive the benefits he may be entitled to under existing laws and may still be reemployed in the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p>The Court agrees with the CA's recommendation. </p><p>Section 93 (a), Rule 19 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (RRACCS) states: </p><blockquote> <p align="center">Rule 19 <b><u><br> DROPPING FROM THE ROLLS</u></b> </p> <p>Section 93. Grounds and Procedure for Dropping from the Rolls. — Officers and employees who are either habitually absent or have unsatisfactory or poor performance or have shown to be physically or mentally unfit to perform their duties may be dropped from the rolls subject to the following procedures: </p> <p><b>a.
