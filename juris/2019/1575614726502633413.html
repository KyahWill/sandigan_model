Consolacion, one of the original mortgagors, cannot claim to have possessed the subject property adverse to herself, while the children of the other mortgagor, Cresente, Sr., merely substituted him in these proceedings. Further, the CA held that the parties did not intend to extinguish their mortgagor-mortgagee relationship, as extant in paragraph 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Compromise Agreement where respondent reserved its right to immediately possess the subject property should petitioners default in any of their payments.<br><br>Moreover, the CA held that the consolidation of <b>Cadastral Case No. 15-0608</b> and <b>Civil Case No. 15-0527</b> was improper, considering that the former is a non-litigious proceeding which involves the ministerial function of issuing an <i>ex-parte</i> writ of possession in favor of respondent,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> while the latter involves the annulment of respondent's Deed of Promise to Sell in favor of J.E. TICO Realty which is litigious in nature.<br><br>Petitioners moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated October 10, 2018; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in directing the issuance of an <i>ex-parte</i> Writ of Possession in favor of respondent.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>In their petition, petitioners maintain,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> among others, that respondent can no longer demand immediate possession of the subject property through an <i>ex-parte</i> motion for the issuance of a writ of possession, in light of the execution of the Compromise Agreement which, they aver, constitutes a "new contract" and a "new legal relationship" between the parties on the thesis that the nature of the transaction embraced therein involves a sale of the subject property. Respondent refutes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> petitioners' stance, insisting that the Compromise Agreement was simply what it is – a compromise entered between the parties designed to put an end to litigation, non-compliance therewith being a ground to rescind the compromise. Moreover, the mortgagor-mortgagee regime between the parties was never extinguished, as respondent never transferred ownership of the subject property to petitioners upon the execution of the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br><i><b>The nature of the Compromise Agreement</b></i><br><br>Article 2028<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; of the Civil Code defines a "compromise agreement" as a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions in order to avoid litigation or put an end to one already commenced. If judicially approved, it becomes more than a binding contract; it is a determination of a controversy and has the force and effect of a judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> To have the force of law between the parties, a compromise agreement must comply with the requisites and principles of contracts. Thus, it must have the following elements: (<i>1</i>) the consent of the parties to the compromise; (<i>2</i>) an object certain that is the subject matter of the compromise; and (<i>3</i>) the cause of the obligation that is established. While compromise agreements are generally favored and encouraged by the courts, it must be proved that they were voluntarily, freely, and intelligently entered into by the parties, who had full knowledge of the judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Hence, a compromise agreement, once approved, has the effect of <i>res judicata</i> between the parties and should not be disturbed except for vices of consent, forgery, fraud, misrepresentation, and coercion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that after the extrajudicial foreclosure of the subject property and the consolidation of title in the name of respondent, and during the pendency of Civil Case No. 0236<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> for nullification of the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings filed by petitioners against respondent, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement whereby petitioners were given the opportunity to "buy back" the subject property despite the lapse of the one-year period for redemption. Unfortunately, petitioners defaulted in their obligations under the Compromise Agreement — an allegation that, the Court notes, petitioners never denied. Further, as the CA correctly pointed out,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the terms and conditions of the Compromise Agreement are legally binding upon the parties having been executed without any vice of consent, forgery, fraud, misrepresentation, or coercion.<br><br>The stipulations of the Compromise Agreement, particularly paragraphs (5) and (6) thereof, clearly show the right of respondent to rescind the same and to immediately secure a writ of possession over the subject property. This course of action/option on the part of respondent finds support under Article 2041<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of the Civil Code, which recognizes the right of an aggrieved party to either (<i>1</i>) enforce the compromise by a writ of execution or (<i>2</i>) regard it as rescinded and insist upon his original demand, upon the other party's failure or refusal to abide by the compromise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the Court has acknowledged the option to rescind a compromise agreement due to non-compliance with its terms,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> as explained in <i>Chavez v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>However, in <i>Heirs of Zari, et al. v. Santos</i>, we clarified that the broad precept enunciated in Art. 2037 is qualified by Art. 2041 of the same Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>If one of the parties fails or refuses to abide by the compromise, the other party may either enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded and insist upon his original demand.</blockquote><br>We explained, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>[B]efore the onset of the new Civil Code, there was no right to rescind compromise agreements. Where a party violated the terms of a compromise agreement, the only recourse open to the other party was to enforce the terms thereof.<br><br>When the new Civil Code came into being, its Article 2041 x x x created <i> for the first time</i> the right of rescission. That provision gives to the aggrieved party the right to "either enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded and insist upon his original demand."<i> Article 2041 should obviously be deemed to qualify the broad precept enunciated in Article 2037 that "[a] compromise has upon the parties the effect and authority of res judicata</i>.</blockquote><br>In exercising the second option under Art. 2041, the aggrieved party may, if he chooses, bring the suit contemplated or involved in his original demand, as if there had never been any compromise agreement, without bringing an action for rescission. <b><u>This is because he may regard the compromise as already rescinded by the breach thereof of the other party</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In this regard, the Court must reject petitioners' stance that the "buy back" transaction embraced in the Compromise Agreement was in the nature of a sale and that upon the execution thereof, the parties were deemed to have entered into a new legal relation, citing the doctrine enunciated in the case of <i> Philippine National Bank v. Spouses Pimentel</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (<i>PNB case</i>) to bolster their argument. It bears pointing out, however, that in the PNB case, the parties clearly and unequivocally executed a <u><i>Deed of Conditional Sale</i></u> whereby respondents repurchased the subject property from PNB for Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P7,500,000.00). Thus, the Court ruled therein that "when PNB executed the deed of conditional sale in favor of herein respondents, the transaction is no longer a sale under the provisions of Act No. 3135."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><b><i>The writ of possession must issue as<br>a matter of course</i></b><br><br>The law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and jurisprudence are clear that in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, an order for a writ of possession issues as a matter of course, upon proper motion, after the expiration of the redemption period without the mortgagor exercising the right of redemption, or even during the redemption period, provided a bond is posted to indemnify the debtor in case the foreclosure sale is shown to have been conducted without complying with the requirements of the law or without the debtor violating the mortgage contract. The rationale for the ministerial issuance of a writ of possession is to put the foreclosure buyer in possession of the property sold without delay, since the right to possession is founded on ownership of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Once the title to the property has been consolidated in the buyer's name upon failure of the mortgagor to redeem the property within the one-year redemption period, the writ of possession becomes a matter of right belonging to the buyer. Consequently, the buyer can demand possession of the property at any time. Its right to possession has then ripened into the right of a confirmed absolute owner and the issuance of the writ becomes a ministerial function that does not admit of the exercise of the court's discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The basis of the right to possession is the purchaser's ownership of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence recognizes certain exceptions to the court's ministerial function to issue a writ of possession. In <i>Nagtalon v. UCPB</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court enumerated the following jurisprudential exceptions: (<i>a</i>) gross inadequacy of the purchase price; <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (<i>b</i>) third party claiming right adverse to the mortgagor/debtor,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> and; (<i>c</i>) failure to pay the surplus proceeds of the sale to the mortgagor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> None of the foregoing instances obtain in the present case; as the CA aptly observed,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> petitioners cannot be said to be holding the subject property adverse to themselves, being one of the original mortgagors in the case of Consolacion and the heirs and/or substitute parties in the case of petitioners. Accordingly, the writ of possession must issue as a matter of course in respondent's favor.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
