Inson (Regional Director Inson)'s cognizance of the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion of farmer beneficiaries, and his subsequent issuance of the March 12, 2010 Order disqualifying some members of petitioner Polo Plantation Agrarian Reform Multipurpose Cooperative (POPARMUCO), were improper. Nonetheless, these acts do not constitute an indirect contempt of court.<p> For this Court's resolution is a Petition for Contempt<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by POPARMUCO, a duly organized and registered cooperative of agrarian reform beneficiaries,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against Regional Director Inson of the Department of Agrarian Reform, Region VII, Cebu City. </p><p>Sometime in 2003, a 394.9020-hectare portion of the landholding<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> owned by Polo Coconut Plantation, Inc.

It contended that the City of Tanjay had already reclassified the area into a mixed residential, commercial, and industrial land. It also assailed the eligibility of the identified agrarian reform beneficiaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> On February 16, 2005, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Polo Coconut. It found that the Polo Coconut property was no longer an agricultural land when the Department of Agrarian Reform placed it under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. Further, it held that the identified beneficiaries were not qualified as beneficiaries, as they were not tenants of Polo Coconut.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The Court of Appeals disposed as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is hereby rendered by us DECLARING as NOT VALID the acts of the [Department of Agrarian Reform] of subjecting PCPCI’s [Polo estate] to the coverage of the CARP, of canceling and causing the cancellation of [PCPCI’s] Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2304 covering such land, of issuing or causing the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-36318 for this land in the name of the Republic of the Philippines by way of transfer to it, of issuing or causing the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-802 for the said land in the names of [petitioner-beneficiaries] in the case at bench by way of award of them of such land as purported farm beneficiaries and of doing other things with the end in view of subjecting [the Polo estate] to CARP coverage, SETTING ASIDE and ENJOINING such acts and the consequence thereof, ORDERING the [petitioner-beneficiaries] to vacate the premises of [the Polo estate] if they had entered such premises, and ORDERING the respondent Register of Deeds of Negros Oriental to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title Nos.

Moreover, the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer of Tanjay had allegedly scheduled the relocation and subdivision of the property for the final installation of the qualified beneficiaries.

The Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary's April 3, 2013 Order, he claims, affirms his position that his cognizance of the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion and issuance of related Resolutions and Orders did not constitute defiance of the September 3, 2008 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></p><p> The issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not respondent Regional Director Rodolfo T. Inson's cognizance of the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion of farmer beneficiaries, and his subsequent issuance of the July 7, 2009 Cease and Desist Order and the March 12, 2010 Order disqualifying some of petitioner's members, constitute defiance of this Court's September 3, 2008 Decision in G.R.

Rosa Realty Development Corporation v.

Hence, when seeking to contest the selection of beneficiaries, a party should avail of the administrative remedies under the Department of Agrarian Reform, not under the Adjudication Board. In <i>Concha</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> In <i>Department of Agrarian Reform v. Department of Education, Culture and Sports</i>, this Court held that the administrative prerogative of DAR to identify and select agrarian reform beneficiaries holds sway upon the courts: </p> <blockquote> <p> In the case at bar, the BARC certified that herein farmers were potential CARP beneficiaries of the subject properties. Further, on November 23, 1994, the Secretary of Agrarian Reform through the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO) issued a Notice of Coverage placing the subject properties under CARP. <b>Since the identification and selection of CARP beneficiaries are matters involving strictly the administrative implementation of the CARP, it behooves the courts to exercise great caution in substituting its own determination of the issue, unless there is grave abuse of discretion committed by the administrative agency . . .</b> </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer's (MARO) decision not to include respondents as farmer-beneficiaries must be accorded respect in the absence of abuse of discretion. It bears stressing that it is the MARO or the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer (PARO) who, together with the <i>Barangay</i> Agrarian Reform Committee, screens and selects the possible agrarian beneficiaries. If there are farmers who claim they have priority over those who have been identified by the MARO as beneficiaries of the land, said farmers can file a protest with the MARO or the PARO who is currently processing the Land Distribution Folder. Afterwards, the proper recourse of any individual who seeks to contest the selection of beneficiaries is to avail himself of the administrative remedies under the DAR and not under the DARAB, which is bereft of jurisdiction over this matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Under the new law, Republic Act No. 9700,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> all cases involving the cancellation of certificates of land ownership award and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program are within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary.

These identification cards are validated yearly based on the Department of Agrarian Reform Municipal Office's inspection of the beneficiaries' performance and compliance with their duties under the laws. The Municipal Office checks if they still own and cultivate the landholding awarded to them, or if they have committed any offense. Beneficiaries found to have violated the laws will be removed from the master list. Consequently, their identification cards and emancipation patents or certificates of land ownership award will be canceled. </p><p> Section 24 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law states that the rights and obligations of beneficiaries commence from the time the land is awarded to them. The certificate of land ownership award contains the restrictions and conditions provided in the law and other applicable statutes. Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <em>SECTION 24.</em> <i>Award to Beneficiaries</i>. — <b><i>The rights and responsibilities of the beneficiary shall commence from the time the DAR makes an award of the land to him</i></b>, which award shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days from the time the DAR takes actual possession of the land. Ownership of the beneficiary shall be evidenced by a Certificate of Land Ownership Award, which shall contain the restrictions and conditions provided for in this Act, and shall be recorded in the Register of Deeds concerned and annotated on the Certificate of Title. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The restrictions and conditions refer to payment of annual amortizations, transferability of the awarded land, and proper use of financial and support services, which are found in the following provisions of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 26. <i>Payment by Beneficiaries</i>. — Lands awarded pursuant to this Act shall be paid for by the beneficiaries to the LBP in thirty (30) annual amortizations at six percent (6%) interest per annum. The payments for the first three (3) years after the award may be at reduced amounts as established by the PARC: <i>Provided</i>, That the first five (5) annual payments may not be more than five percent (5%) of the value of the annual gross production as established by the DAR.

Department of Agrarian Reform</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> the petitioners were issued emancipation patents and transfer certificates of title over parcels of land in Barangay Angas, Sta. Josefa, Agusan del Sur, with a total area of 527.83 hectares, from 1984 to 1988. The landholding was brought within the coverage of the Operation Land Transfer under Presidential Decree No. 27 upon the request of its previous owner, Hacienda Maria, Inc. </p><p> However, in December 1997, Hacienda Maria, Inc. filed 17 petitions before the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator of CARAGA, Region XIII. These petitions sought the declaration of erroneous coverage under Presidential Decree No. 27 of 277.5008 hectares of its former landholdings. Hacienda Maria, Inc. claimed that the area was untenanted, and that it was not paid compensation for it. It sought that the emancipation patents covering the disputed area be canceled. </p><p> The Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator declared as void the transfer certificates of title and emancipation patents over the disputed area. The Adjudication Board affirmed this decision. The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' appeal on technicality, since the Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping was not signed by all petitioners. </p><p> This Court sustained the validity of the transfer certificates of title and emancipation patents. It held that certificates of title issued pursuant to emancipation patents are as indefeasible as transfer certificates of title issued in registration proceedings. Further, it ruled that the transfer certificates of title issued to the petitioners became indefeasible upon the expiration of one (1) year from the issuance of the emancipation patents. Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <i>Ybañez v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>, provides that certificates of title issued in administrative proceedings are as indefeasible as certificates of title issued in judicial proceedings: </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> The same confusion, uncertainty and suspicion on the distribution of government-acquired lands to the landless would arise if the possession of the grantee of an EP would still be subject to contest, just because his certificate of title was issued in an administrative proceeding. The silence of Presidential Decree No. 27 as to the indefeasibility of titles issued pursuant thereto is the same as that in the Public Land Act where Prof. Antonio Noblejas commented: </p> <blockquote> <p> Inasmuch as there is no positive statement of the Public Land Law, regarding the titles granted thereunder, such silence should be construed and interpreted in favor of the homesteader who come into the possession of his homestead after complying with the requirements thereof. Section 38 of the Land Registration Law should be interpreted to apply by implication to the patent issued by the Director of Lands, duly approved by the Minister of Natural Resources, under the signature of the President of the Philippines, in accordance with law. </p> </blockquote> <p> After complying with the procedure, therefore, in Section 105 of Presidential Decree No. 1529, otherwise known as the Property Registration Decree (where the DAR is required to issue the corresponding certificate of title after granting an EP to tenant-farmers who have complied with Presidential Decree No. 27), the TCTs issued to petitioners pursuant to their EPs acquire the same protection accorded to other TCTs. "The certificate of title becomes indefeasible and incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from the date of the issuance of the order for the issuance of the patent, . . . Lands covered by such title may no longer be the subject matter of a cadastral proceeding, nor can it be decreed to another person." </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> <i>The EPs themselves, like the Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs) in Republic Act No. 6657 (the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988), are enrolled in the Torrens system of registration. The Property Registration Decree in fact devotes Chapter IX on the subject of EPs. Indeed, such EPs and CLOAs are, in themselves, entitled to be as indefeasible as certificates of title issued in registration proceedings.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Heirs of Nuñez, Sr. v. Heirs of Villanoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> where the issue was the retention limit of the purported heirs of the landowner, this Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Finally, the issuance of the title to Villanoza could no longer be revoked or set aside by Secretary Pangandaman. Acquiring the lot in good faith, Villanoza registered his Certificate of Land Ownership Award title under the Torrens system. He was issued a new and regular title, TCT No. NT-299755, in fee simple; that is to say, it is an absolute title, without qualification or restriction. </p> <p> <i>Estribillo v. Department of Agrarian Reform</i> has held that "certificates of title issued in administrative proceedings are as indefeasible as [those] issued in judicial proceedings." Section 2 of Administrative Order No. 03-09 provides that "[t]he State recognizes the indefeasibility of [Certificate of Land Ownership Awards], [Emancipation Patents] and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program." </p> <p> Here, a Certificate of Land Ownership Award title was already issued and registered in Villanoza's favor on December 7, 2007. Villanoza's Certificate of Land Ownership Award was titled under the Torrens system on November 24, 2004. After the expiration of one (1) year, the certificate of title covering the property became irrevocable and indefeasible. Secretary Pangandaman's August 8, 2007 Order, which came almost three (3) years later, was thus ineffective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Section 24 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, as amended by Republic Act No. 9700, now explicitly provides that certificates of land ownership award, "being titles brought under the operation of the [T]orrens [S]ystem," enjoy the same indefeasibility and security afforded to all titles under the Torrens System: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 24. Award to beneficiaries. — The rights and responsibilities of the beneficiaries shall commence from their receipt of a duly registered emancipation patent or certificate of land ownership award and their actual physical possession of the awarded land.

The emancipation patents or <b><i>the certificates of land ownership award being titles brought under the operation of the Torrens system, are conferred with the same indefeasibility and security afforded to all titles under the said system, as provided for by Presidential Decree No. 1529, as amended by Republic Act No. 6732.</i></b> </p> <p> It is the ministerial duty of the Registry of Deeds to register the title of the land in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, after the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) has certified that the necessary deposit in the name of the landowner constituting full payment in cash or in bond with due notice to the landowner and the registration of the certificate of land ownership award issued to the beneficiaries, and to cancel previous titles pertaining thereto. </p> <p> Identified and qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries, based on Section 22 of Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, shall have usufructuary rights over the awarded land as soon as the DAR takes possession of such land, and such right shall not be diminished even pending the awarding of the emancipation patent or the certificate of land ownership award. </p> <p> All cases involving the cancellation of registered emancipation patents, certificates of land ownership award, and other titles issued under any agrarian reform program are within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Secretary of the DAR. </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, by the time the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion was filed on June 30, 2009, the September 3, 2008 Decision declaring the validity of CLOA No. 00114438 had attained finality and TCT No. T-802 had already become incontrovertible. As registered property owners, petitioner's members were entitled to the protection given to every Torrens title holder. Their rights may only be forfeited in case of violations of agrarian laws, as well as noncompliance with the restrictions and conditions under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> However, petitioner's assertion that respondent's cognizance of the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion constituted defiance of the September 3, 2008 Decision does not lie. </p><p> In <i>Rivulet Agro-Industrial Corporation v. Paruñgao</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> this Court explained the concept of contempt of court: </p><blockquote> <p> Contempt of court is defined as a disobedience to the court by acting in opposition to its authority, justice, and dignity, and signifies not only <i>a willful disregard of the court's order, hut such conduct which tends to bring the authority of the court and the administration of law into disrepute or, in some manner, to impede the due administration of justice</i>. To be considered contemptuous, an act must be clearly contrary to or prohibited by the order of the court. Thus, a person cannot be punished for contempt for disobedience of an order of the Court, unless the act which is forbidden or required to be done is clearly and exactly defined, so that there can be no reasonable doubt or uncertainty as to what specific act or thing is forbidden or required.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The court's contempt power should be exercised with restraint and for a preservative, and not vindictive, purpose. "Only in cases of clear and contumacious refusal to obey should the power be exercised."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> </p><p> In <i>Rivulet Agro-Industrial Corporation</i>, the Department officials' act of installing farmer-beneficiaries in Rivulet Agro-Industrial Corporation's landholding did not constitute an open defiance and disobedience of this Court's December 15, 2010 temporary restraining order in G.R. No. 193585. This Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> [W]hile the DAR was an intervenor in G.R. No. 193585, the December 15, 2010 TRO issued by the Court was only expressly directed against the LRA Administrator, the Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental and/or all persons acting upon their order or in their place and stead, and specifically for the following acts: "(a) from canceling Transfer Certificate of Title No. 105742 issued in favor of petitioner RIVULET Agro-Industrial Corporation; (b) from issuing a new certificate of title in the name of the Republic of the Philippines; (c) from issuing Certificate of Land Ownership Award in favor of anyone covering Hacienda Bacan, a 157.2992-hectare property situated in the Municipality of Isabela, Province of Negros Occidental; and (d) distributing such Certificate of Land Ownership Award that it may have heretofore issued pending trial on the merits." Clearly, the DAR and its officials were not among those enjoined. Neither can they be considered agents of the LRA Administrator and the Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental. Moreover, the installation of farmer-beneficiaries was not among the acts specifically restrained, negating the claim that the performance thereof was a contumacious act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Here, respondent justified his cognizance of the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion based on the Department's exclusive prerogative in the identification, selection, and subsequent re-evaluation of agrarian reform beneficiaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> </p><p> However, as earlier stated, the issue on the qualification of the existing Certificate of Land Ownership Award holders had long been laid to rest in this Court's final and executory September 3, 2008 Decision. Some of the petitioners in the inclusion/exclusion proceedings were even respondents in that case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> </p><p> Still, respondent's erroneous cognizance of the Petition for Inclusion/Exclusion can only be deemed as grave abuse of discretion, which is more properly the subject of a petition for certiorari, not a petition for contempt. "No one who is called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> </p><p> At any rate, whether respondent's actions were improper is not an issue here. What is crucial in contempt proceedings is the intent of the alleged contemnor to disobey or defy the court as held in <i>St. Louis University, Inc. v. Olairez</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> In contempt, the intent goes to the gravamen of the offense. Thus, the good faith or lack of it, of the alleged contemnor is considered. Where the act complained of is ambiguous or does not clearly show on its face that it is contempt, and is one which, if the party is acting in good faith, is within his rights, the presence or absence of a contumacious intent is, in some instances, held to be determinative of its character. . . . <i>To constitute contempt, the act must be done wil[l]fully and for an illegitimate or improper purpose</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> All told, this Court finds no clear and contumacious conduct on the part of respondent.
