Casiño</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> discusses the scope of the writ and the reliefs that may be granted under it:<br><blockquote>The writ is categorized as a special civil action and was, thus, conceptualized as an extraordinary remedy, which aims to provide judicial relief from threatened or actual violation/s of the constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology of a magnitude or degree of damage that transcends political and territorial boundaries.

The gravity of environmental damage sufficient to grant the writ is, thus, to be decided on a case-to-case basis.<br><br>If the petitioner successfully proves the foregoing requisites, the court shall render judgment granting the privilege of the writ of kalikasan. Otherwise, the petition shall be denied. If the petition is granted, the court may grant the reliefs provided for under Section 15 of Rule 7, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 15.

Before private parties or public interest groups may proceed with the case, they must be ready with the evidence necessary for the determination of the writ's issuance.<br><br>In <i>LNL Archipelago Minerals v. Agham Party List</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> this Court denied the petition for the issuance of the writ filed by a party list group advocating for the protection of the environment. This was due to the group's failure to substantiate its allegations:<br><blockquote>It is well-settled that a party claiming the privilege for the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan has to show that a law, rule or regulation was violated or would be violated. In the present case, the allegation by Agham that two laws — the Revised Forestry Code, as amended, and the Philippine Mining Act — were violated by LAMI was not adequately substantiated by Agham. Even the facts submitted by Agham to establish environmental damage were mere general allegations.<br><br>Second, Agham's allegation that there was a "mountain" [levelled] in LAMI's port site was earlier established as false as the "mountain" was non-existent as proven by the testimonies of the witnesses and reports made by environmental experts and persons who have been educated and trained in their respective fields.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote>This was, unfortunately, not the only time that environmental advocates have come to this Court unprepared. In <i>Paje</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> this Court denied a petition filed against the construction of a coal-fired power plant in Subic Bay Industrial Park for the public interest group's failure to provide the necessary evidence:<br><blockquote>The records of this case painfully chronicle the embarrassingly inadequate evidence marshalled by those that initially filed the Petition for a Writ of Kalikasan. Even with the most conscientious perusal of the records and with the most sympathetic view for the interests of the community and the environment, the obvious conclusion that there was not much thought or preparation in substantiating the allegations made in the Petition cannot be hidden. Legal advocacy for the environment deserves much more.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup></blockquote>The imminence or emergency of an ecological disaster should not be an excuse for litigants to do away with their responsibility of substantiating their petitions before the courts. As with any special civil action for extraordinary writs, parties seeking the writ of kalikasan must be ready with the evidence required to prove their allegations by the time the petition is filed. Hasty slipshod petitions, filed in the guise of environmental advocacy, only serve to undermine that advocacy:<br><blockquote>Environmental advocacy is primarily motivated by care and compassion for communities and the environment. It can rightly be a passionately held mission. It is founded on faith that the world as it is now can be different. It implies the belief that the longer view of protecting our ecology should never be sacrificed for short-term convenience.<br><br>However, environmental advocacy is not only about passion. It is also about responsibility. There are communities with almost no resources and are at a disadvantage against large projects that might impact on their livelihoods. Those that take the cudgels lead them as they assert their ecological rights must show that they have both the professionalism and the capability to carry their cause forward. When they file a case to protect the interests of those who they represent, they should be able to make both allegation and proof. The dangers from an improperly managed environmental case are as real to the communities sought to be represented as the dangers from a project by proponents who do not consider their interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br></blockquote>Environmental advocacy requires more than passion for saving the environment. Thus:<br><blockquote>Certainly, there is a need for leaders, organizations, and dedicated movements that amplify the concerns of communities, groups, and identities which tend to be put in the margins of forums dominated by larger and more politically connected commercial interests. This includes forums that create and implement regulatory frameworks. Liberal democratic deliberations at times fail to represent the silenced majority as it succumbs to the powerful minority.<br><br>While acknowledging this reality, we also need to be careful that the chambers of this court do not substitute for the needed political debate on public issues or the analytical rigor required by truths in science. We are Justices primarily. While politics and science envelope some of our important decisions, we should not lose the humility that the Constitution itself requires of us. We are an important part of the constitutional order: always only a part, never one that should dominate. Our decisions have the veneer of finality. It should never, however, be disguised superiority in any form or manner.<br><br>Political debates indeed also mature when we pronounce the nature of fundamental rights in concrete cases. Before cases ripen — or, as in this case, when it has become moot — restraint will be the better approach. We participate in the shaping of the content of these fundamental rights only with the guidance of an actual case. This, among others, distinguishes the judicial function from the purely political engagement.<br><br>....<br><br>If any, the resolution of this case implies rigor in environmental advocacy. Vigilance and passion are the hallmarks of the public interest movement. There is no reason that the members of this movement should not evolve the proper skills and attitudes to properly work the legal system and understand the role of the judicial process. Environmental advocacy also requires an understanding of science and the locating of the proper place of various norms such as the precautionary principle. After all, representation of marginalized community voices deserves excellent representation and responsible leadership. Filing a judicial remedy almost two years too late and without the required scientific rigor patently required by the allegations and the arguments misses these standards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br></blockquote>A writ of kalikasan cannot and should not substitute other remedies that may be available to the parties, whether legal, administrative, or political. Mere concern for the environment is not an excuse to invoke this Court's jurisdiction in cases where other remedies are available:<br><blockquote>The function of the extraordinary and equitable remedy of a Writ of Kalikasan should not supplant other available remedies and the nature of the forums that they provide. The Writ of Kalikasan is a highly prerogative writ that issues only when there is a showing of actual or imminent threat and when there is such inaction on the part of the relevant administrative bodies that will make an environmental catastrophe inevitable. It is not a remedy that is availing when there is no actual threat or when imminence of danger is not demonstrable. The Writ of Kalikasan thus is not an excuse to invoke judicial remedies when there still remain administrative forums to properly address the common concern to protect and advance ecological rights. After all, we cannot presume that only the Supreme Court can conscientiously fulfill the ecological duties required of the entire state.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, there are other legal remedies available:<br><blockquote>The writ of kalikasan is not an all-embracing legal remedy to be wielded like a political tool. It is both an extraordinary and equitable remedy which assists to prevent environmental catastrophes. It does not replace other legal remedies similarly motivated by concern for the environment and the community's ecological welfare. Certainly, when the petition itself alleges that remedial and preventive remedies have occurred, the functions of the writ cease to exist. In case of disagreement, parties need to exhaust the political and administrative arena. Only when a concrete cause of action arises out of facts that can be proven with substantial evidence may the proper legal action be entertained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br></blockquote>A writ of continuing mandamus, on the other hand, "is a special civil action that may be availed of 'to compel the performance of an act specifically enjoined by law.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Rule 8, Section 1 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Petition for continuing mandamus. — When any agency or instrumentality of the government or officer thereof unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station in connection with the enforcement or violation of an environmental law rule or regulation or a right therein, or unlawfully excludes another from the use or enjoyment of such right and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty, attaching thereto supporting evidence, specifying that the petition concerns an environmental law, rule or regulation, and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to do an act or series of acts until the judgment is fully satisfied, and to pay damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the malicious neglect to perform the duties of the respondent, under the law, rules or regulations. The petition shall also contain a sworn certification of non-forum shopping.<br></blockquote>The rationale for the grant of the writ was explained in <i>Boracay Foundation, Inc. v. Province of Aklan</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><blockquote>Environmental law highlights the shift in the focal-point from the initiation of regulation by Congress to the implementation of regulatory programs by the appropriate government agencies.<br><br>Thus, a government agency's inaction, if any, has serious implications on the future of environmental law enforcement. Private individuals, to the extent that they seek to change the scope of the regulatory process, will have to rely on such agencies to take the initial incentives, which may require a judicial component. Accordingly, questions regarding the propriety of an agency's action or inaction will need to be analyzed.<br><br>This point is emphasized in the availability of the remedy of the writ of mandamus, which allows for the enforcement of the conduct of the tasks to which the writ pertains: the performance of a legal duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>While Rule 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases provides a civil procedure for the enforcement or violation of environmental laws, Rule 8 provides a distinct remedy and procedure for allegations of unlawful neglect in the enforcement of environmental laws or the unlawful exclusion in the use or enjoyment of an environmental right. As with the procedure in special civil actions for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, this procedure also requires that the petition should be sufficient in form and substance before a court can take further action. Failure to comply may be basis for the petition's outright dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Sufficiency in the substance of a petition for a writ of continuing mandamus requires:<br><blockquote>... that the petition must contain substantive allegations specifically constituting an actionable neglect or omission and must establish, at the very least, a <i>prima facie</i> basis for the issuance of the writ, viz.: (1) an agency or instrumentality of government or its officer unlawfully neglects the performance of an act or unlawfully excludes another from the use or enjoyment of a right; (2) the act to be performed by the government agency, instrumentality or its officer is specifically enjoined by law as a duty; (3) such duty results from an office, trust or station in connection with the enforcement or violation of an environmental law, rule or regulation or a right therein; and (4) there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the course of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The writ is essentially a <i>continuing</i> order of the court, as it:<br><blockquote>... "permits the court to retain jurisdiction after judgment in order to ensure the successful implementation of the reliefs mandated under the court's decision" and, in order to do this, "the court may compel the submission of compliance reports from the respondent government agencies as well as avail of other means to monitor compliance with its decision."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote>However, requiring the periodic submission of compliance reports does not mean that the court acquires supervisory powers over administrative agencies. This interpretation would violate the principle of the separation of powers since courts do not have the power to enforce laws, create laws, or revise legislative actions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The writ should not be used to supplant executive or legislative privileges.

Asiado, Primo M. Asiado, Adrian P. Abayan, Danilo Belono, Romeo Malaguit, Dennis Bania, and Jing Malinao, on the ground that they were "on Pag-asa Island and the undersigned counsels cannot travel to meet them there; or ... communicate with them as Philippine telephone companies have no or very weak network coverage there."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> As for two (2) of the fisherfolk-petitioners in Zambales, they reasoned that Labrador and Rolando have since moved away and did not leave any contact details.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>Rule 138, Section 26 of the Rules of Court provides the rule on withdrawal of counsels:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 138 <br>Attorneys and Admission to Bar<br></center>....<br><br>SECTION 26. Change of attorneys. — An attorney may retire at any time from any action or special proceeding, by the written consent of his client filed in court. He may also retire at any time from an action or special proceeding, without the consent of his client, should the court, on notice to the client and attorney, and on hearing, determine that he ought to be allowed to retire. In case of substitution, the name of the attorney newly employed shall be entered on the docket of the court in place of the former one, and written notice of the change shall be given to the adverse party.<br></blockquote>A counsel may only be allowed to withdraw from the action either with the written consent of the client or "from a good cause." In <i>Orcino v. Gaspar</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><blockquote>The rule in this jurisdiction is that a client has the absolute right to terminate the attorney-client relation at any time with or without cause. The right of an attorney to withdraw or terminate the relation other than for sufficient cause is, however, considerably restricted. Among the fundamental rules of ethics is the principle that an attorney who undertakes to conduct an action impliedly stipulates to carry it to its conclusion. He is not at liberty to abandon it without reasonable cause. A lawyer's right to withdraw from a case before its final adjudication arises only from the client's written consent or from a good cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br></blockquote>Canon 22, Rule 22.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides the "good causes" under which a counsel may withdraw without the written conformity of the client:<br><blockquote>CANON 22 — A LAWYER SHALL WITHDRAW HIS SERVICES ONLY FOR GOOD CAUSE AND UPON NOTICE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.<br><br>Rule 22.01 A lawyer may withdraw his services in any of the following cases:<br><br>a) When the client pursues an illegal or immoral course of conduct in connection with the matter he is handling;<br><br>b) When the client insists that the lawyer pursue conduct violative of these canons and rules;<br><br>c) When his inability to work with co-counsel will not promote the best interest of the client;<br><br>d) When the mental or physical condition of the lawyer renders it difficult for him to carry out the employment effectively;<br><br>e) When the client deliberately fails to pay the fees for the services or fails to comply with the retainer agreement;<br><br>f) When the lawyer is elected or appointed to public office; and<br><br>g) Other similar cases.<br></blockquote>Failure to contact the client despite diligent efforts is not considered under this Rule as a "good cause" upon which a lawyer may withdraw from the case without first seeking the client's written conformity. Had this Court granted the Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, 20 fisherfolk-petitioners would be left without counsel to inquire if they were still pursuing the case.<br><br>Even if we were to apply liberality and consider the fisherfolk-petitioners' affidavits disowning the Petition as their written conformity to counsels' withdrawal, the other fisherfolk-petitioners who verified the Petition but submitted no affidavit would have been left without any representation:<br><blockquote>1. Ronel Badilla<br>2. Jonel Hugo<br>3. Ricardo Natural<br>4. Sanny Belidan<br>5. Rowel P. Ejona<br>6. Rolando Labandelo<br></blockquote>To recall, petitioners' counsels filed a Motion for Extension of Time to Confer with Clients and Obtain Special Authority,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> citing as basis Rule 138, Section 23 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 23. Authority of attorneys to bind clients. — Attorneys have authority to bind their clients in any case by any agreement in relation thereto made in writing, and in taking appeals, and in all matters of ordinary judicial procedure. But they cannot, without special authority, compromise their client's litigation, or receive anything in discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash.<br></blockquote>Counsels' filing of their Motion to Withdraw as Counsel without prior notice to the clients is a violation of the very rule they sought to uphold. The Petition's withdrawal compromises their clients' litigation, since the case will be dismissed without their consent and without prior notice. In <i>Natividad v. Natividad</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><blockquote>The cause of action, the claim or demand sued upon, and the subject matter of the litigation are all within the exclusive control of the client; and the attorney may not impair, compromise, settle, surrender, or destroy them without his client's consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Monteverde v. Court of Industrial Relations</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> likewise held:<br><blockquote>The main issue is whether or not the Court of Industrial Relations correctly dismissed the case for unfair labor practice after it had rendered a decision dated March 21, 1968 on the motion of Atty. Juan G. Sison, Jr., counsel of the petitioners, without inquiring into the authority of the lawyer to ask for the dismissal of the case.<br><br>It was stated in the dissenting opinion of Judge Amando C. Bugayong that nowhere in the minutes of the hearing of July 23, 1969 does it appear that the complainants have admitted in open court that they had authorized their counsel, Atty. Juan G. Sison, Jr., to enter into a settlement with the FIBISCO. All that is recorded in the minutes is the request for the sending of a notice of hearing to Atty. Juan G. Sison, Jr. both at his known address at Rm. 313 de Leon Bldg., Rizal Avenue, Manila and at 745 Dos Castillas, Sampaloc, Manila.<br><br>It is elementary that lawyers "cannot, without special authority, compromise their client's litigation, or receive anything in discharge of a client's claim but the full amount in cash."<br><br>It is clear that the Court of Industrial Relations erred in dismissing the case on the motion of Atty. Juan G. Sison, Jr. alone without inquiring into his authority. The Court of Industrial Relations did not even bother to find out what kind of settlement was entered into between Atty. Juan G. Sison, Jr. and the FIBISCO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>Belandres vs. Lopez Sugar Central Mill Company, Inc.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><blockquote>"The broad implied or apparent powers of an attorney with respect to the conduct or control of litigation are, however, limited to matters which relate only to the procedure or remedy. The employment of itself confers upon the attorney no implied or apparent power or authority over the subject matter of the cause of action or defense; and, unless the attorney has expressly been granted authority with respect thereto, the power to deal with or surrender these matters is regarded as remaining exclusively in the client."<br><br>"The line of demarcation between the respective rights and powers of an attorney and his client is clearly defined. The cause of action, the claim or demand sued upon, and the subject matter of the litigation are all within the exclusive control of a client; and an attorney may not impair, compromise, settle, surrender, or destroy them without his client's consent. But all the proceedings in court to enforce the remedy to bring the claim, demand, cause of action, or subject matter of the suit to hearing, trial, determination, judgment, and execution, are within the exclusive control of the attorney."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br></blockquote>To prevent compromising the interests of the remaining fisherfolk-petitioners, this Court, instead of granting the Motion to Withdraw as Counsel, required counsels to exert more efforts in contacting their clients. In <i>Mercado v. Commission on Higher Education</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><blockquote>The rule that the withdrawal of a counsel with the written conformity of the client is immediately effective once filed in court, however, is not absolute. When the counsel's impending withdrawal with the written conformity of the client would leave the latter with no legal representation in the case, it is an accepted practice for courts to order the deferment of the effectivity of such withdrawal until such time that it becomes certain that service of court processes and other papers to the party-client would not thereby be compromised — either by the due substitution of the withdrawing counsel in the case or by the express assurance of the party-client that he now undertakes to himself receive serviceable processes and other papers. Adoption by courts of such a practice in that particular context, while neither mandatory nor sanctioned by a specific provision of the Rules of Court, is nevertheless justified as part of their inherent power to see to it that the potency of judicial processes and judgment are preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners' counsels had the responsibility, right at the start of their engagement, to establish the modality of communication with their clients. Mere difficulty in contacting the client is not a sufficient reason for his or her counsel to abandon his or her cause, more so in this case where counsels are rendering legal aid <i>pro bono</i>. Counsels should exert the same amount of professionalism, regardless of their client's capacity to pay for their services.<br><br>Nonetheless, it would be unjust for this Court to compel the two (2) remaining fisherfolk-petitioners, Sanny and Ejona, to continue with this case without legal counsel. Petitioners' counsels have likewise manifested that they exerted earnest attempts to contact them on their cellular phones but were unable to as the two were no longer in Pag-asa Island. This Court also takes note of the six (6) fisherfolk-petitioners' handwritten letter dated July 15, 2019, in which they manifested their representation of the other members of the fisherfolk association:<br><blockquote><i>Bilang mga kinatawan ng samahan ng Fisherfolks ng Kalayaan at upang patunayan ang kagustuhan ng nakararami</i>, aming inilagda ang aming mga pangalan ngayong araw na ito sa Lungsod ng Pto. Princesa.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>For this reason, this Court considers the Petition withdrawn as to <i>all</i> fisherfolk-petitioners. The case is considered dismissed, without passing upon any of the substantive issues raised.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Motion to Withdraw the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The case is considered <b>DISMISSED</b>, without passing upon any of the substantive issues raised.<br><br>In view of the unusual procedural developments of this case, counsels of petitioners are <b>STERNLY WARNED</b> to be mindful of their duties and obligations under the Code of Professional Responsibility and that the same or similar infractions in the future shall be dealt with more severely by this Court.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Bersamin, C.

I must point out, however, that the petition should have been dismissed outright due to procedural and substantive defects.<br><br>The petition for writ of <i>kalikasan</i> should have been dismissed outright for the following reasons: (1) no judicial affidavits were attached to the petition to support that claim that respondents omitted, failed and/or refused to enforce Philippine Laws at the Panatag Shoal, the Ayungin Shoal, and the Panganiban reef; (2) the foreign fishermen and other foreign entities who violated Philippine environmental laws in the said shoals and reef, have not been impleaded in the petition as respondents; and (3) the factual and evidentiary issues raised must be referred to the Court of Appeals, for appropriate resolution.<br><br>The petition for writ of continuing mandamus should, likewise, be dismissed outright, because there is no clear allegation how respondents have failed or have been remiss in performing their duties in enforcing environmental laws. The petition should have been filed first with the Court of Appeals because there are factual and evidentiary issues raised. Although the rules may or may not allow a hearing, the allegations in the petition clearly show facts that have to be established and proven, through judicial affidavits and memoranda.<br><br>The case of <i>MMDA, et al. v. Concerned Residents of Manila Bay, etc., et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is different from this case because the Court took judicial notice of the pollution in Manila Bay, and the parties did not raise any contradictory facts. Here, the Office of the Solicitor General disputes the allegations insofar as respondents are being accused of malicious neglect in performing their official duties under the law, rules or regulations.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases requires that the verified petition for issuance of a writ of <i>kalikasan</i> should contain, among other matters, all relevant and material evidence consisting of the affidavits of witnesses, documentary evidence, scientific and other expert studies, and if possible, object evidence. Here, nothing in the Annexes attached to the petition pertains to respondents' supposed omission, failure and/or refusal to enforce Philippine Laws in Panatag Shoal, Ayungin Shoal, and Panganiban reef.<br><br>During the oral arguments on July 2, 2019, counsel for petitioners admitted the absence of judicial affidavits, and I explained the rationale for attaching such affidavits to support a petition for writ of <i>kalikasan</i>, thus:<br><blockquote><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>Some of the questions that I was thinking of asking you have already been asked by Justice Leonen. So I will just ask you some clarificatory questions. Number one is that <b>there is an admission from you that x x x there are no judicial affidavits or competent evidence attached to your petition?</b><br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor, we're invoking the rule of the Rules of Court on mandatory judicial notice where the Court will take judicial notice without the requirement of submission of evidence, Your Honor.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br><b>But it is clear from the special rule that the petition must be accompanied by judicial affidavits. The reason why we require that is that, in all writs of <i>kalikasan</i> when we were preparing, when we were drafting this rule, all the issues that will be raised are factual. That's why we require the submission of judicial affidavit and competent evidence.</b> Now[,] if the facts that you alleged are disputed by the Solicitor General, can we resolve your petition? Just merely saying that we are, you are using the evidence submitted in the arbitral proceedings pertaining to the acts allegedly committed in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014?<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Well, yes, Your Honor. The Court may want to look at those submissions by the executive branch which actually are matters of mandatory judicial notice and..... (interrupted)<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br><b>The reason why we require judicial affidavit is that x x x the opposing party can cross-examine the person who alleged that an illegal act was committed. Without the judicial affidavit, which will now be the direct testimony of the witness, we cannot test the credibility of the affiant[,] because as I've said a while ago, we anticipated that all writs of <i>kalikasan</i> will involve factual issues because you just look at the elements, acts complained of, you have to establish what are the acts complained of, and then, the respondent, in their answer or in the return of the writ must likewise submit judicial affidavits and then indicate their defenses.</b> So how can we resolve this petition without the judicial affidavits on the part of the petitioners[,] and also judicial affidavits — on the part of the respondents?<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor. I think this case presents a unique opportunity for the Court to examine the situation where there are x x x essential facts which can support the grant.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>Yeah, to me that's my problem. Because what you are saying is that the facts are not disputed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>During the oral arguments, petitioner also implied that they did not implead as respondents the indispensable parties, namely, the foreign fishermen and other foreign entities who violated Philippine environmental laws in the said shoals and reef, thus:<br><blockquote><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>My other concern is this. <b>The acts complained of not only against the public officials, but also other persons because you have to implead the other persons who are violating our environmental law, to me, these are indispensable parties. If we issue a privilege of writ of <i>kalikasan</i>, would it be sufficient just to address them to the public official. Is it not that we have also to address those who are violating, those who are violating our environmental rights?</b><br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>We believe, Your Honor, that <b>we have impleaded the necessary parties for this case</b>. And that we do not have to implead the private individuals who violated the Philippine environmental laws, they, Your Honor, are subject of criminal or administrative prosecution by the respondents.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>Probably, that will fall on x x x continuing mandamus. <b>The writ of <i>kalikasan</i> is to stop the parties from violating our environment. If it's the public official that is violating our environmental right, then, it can be the subject of the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> because the respondents here are public officials.</b><br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>Who are supposed to enforce our environmental laws, <i>sa</i> continuing mandamus <i>iyan</i>.<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>The writ of <i>kalikasan</i> is actually addressed to those who are violating[,] not to those who do not enforce the environmental law[.] [T]hat is why, probably, you filed two petitions in one petition. You put writ of <i>kalikasan</i> and writ of mandamus because if the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> is not proper then probably writ of mandamus will substitute[,] or will be the alternative resolution to your petitions, is it not?<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor, if I may respond, we are looking at the rules of writ of <i>kalikasan</i>, Rule 7[,] and in the section on the reliefs available to the parties[,] one of the reliefs, number one, the first relief that's available to the parties is a directive from the Court for the violator to cease and desist from the unlawful neglect of their duty, Your Honor.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>Because you know, Counsel, if we issue the privilege of the writ, and therefore, we will tell those who violate the rule against whom will the writ be issued?<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Your Honor.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>There are no respondents who are supposed to be the violators.<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor.... (interrupted)<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>As simple as this, you have a company violating our environmental law, alright? And probably [emitting obnoxious,] or something that is obnoxious, and therefore, violation of our environmental law. Here comes a company. The writ will be issued against the company that's violating the environmental law. Here, you want a writ of <i>kalikasan</i> to be issued against the public official. The public official is not violating our environmental law. According to you[,] they are neglecting their duties to enforce the environmental law.<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>The petition for writ of continuing mandamus should also be dismissed outright, because there is no clear allegation and judicial affidavits to show how respondents have failed or have been remiss in performing their duties in enforcing environmental laws. During the oral arguments, I discussed the nature of omission on the part of a public official to warrant the issuance of such writ of mandamus, the need for judicial affidavits and the factual and evidentiary nature of issues involved in a writ of <i>kalikasan</i> proceeding, thus:<br><blockquote><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>Okay, now let us go to continuing mandamus. The law is very clear [...] <b>unlawfully neglects his duty</b>. <b>We anticipated when we [were] drafting these rules[,] that if we do not place unlawfully neglects then mere negligence, the public official will be the subject matter of the continuing mandamus. Because there is [a] difference between mere negligence and unlawfully neglecting his duties. So can you [see] based [on] your evidence that the public officials are unlawfully neglecting their duties in enforcing environmental law. There is no judicial affidavit to prove that in the petition.</b> So what shall we do? I think the law is very clear. <b>Unlawfully neglect is not a mere negligence. So that the respondents could have also submitted their evidence to show that probably there is negligence but they did not unlawfully neglect their duties. That's why you know, we anticipated that all of these x x x, may involve factual issues that's why we required that these cases should also be brought to the Court of Appeals because the Court of Appeals is a Court where it can receive evidence[,] not the Supreme Court.</b> The Supreme Court was only included there because we do not divest the Supreme Court of jurisdiction of any case that may be brought before any other court. That's why the Supreme Court is included there as a forum over which the petition may be filed. But the issues are factual[.] [W]e do not [...] we cannot receive evidence here and require the parties to testify here, and then, cross-examine.<br><br><b>ATTY. PALACIOS:</b><br>Yes, Your Honor.<br><br><b>ASSOCIATE JUSTICE PERALTA:</b><br>And then, because of the urgency, we require that this petition should be resolved within sixty (60) days. I hope the Solicitor General will not dispute the facts as you have stated a while ago. Because the moment that they will dispute the facts, who will now resolve [...] [t]hat the evidence of the petitioners is more credible than the evidence of the Solicitor General [?] Who will now resolve it?<br><br><b>ATTY.

They claim, among their causes of action, violations by China of environmental law within the Philippine exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Petitioners invoke factual findings made by the Arbitral Tribunal in the Award it issued in PCA Case No. 2013-19, entitled "<i>Republic of the Philippines v. The People's Republic of China</i>," a case filed by the Philippine Government concerning the interpretation and application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).<br><br>The Arbitral Award is an undeniably unanimous,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> historic, and sweeping victory,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> not only for the government but also for the Filipino people. It has become an enduring part of international law, clarifying, as it did, important aspects of the UNCLOS, such as the nature of the maritime entitlements provided therein and the limits of their lawful exercise. Unfortunately, however, there is no international law enforcer or sheriff who can compel China to comply with the Arbitral Award. Such is a limitation of international law which makes enforcement of international law obligations, in general, and international awards, much like the one issued in our country's favor, in particular, a genuine challenge.<br><br>There are nevertheless a number of ways by which one can <i>attempt</i> to enforce international law obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> It is my view that the case brought before Us now is an attempt on the part of petitioners to enforce compliance with the Arbitral Award, this time, through the use of domestic environmental laws. Specifically, petitioners, on the strength of the findings of violations of environmental laws within the Philippine's EEZ <i>as set forth in the arbitral award</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> seek the issuance of writs of <i>kalikasan</i> and continuing <i>mandamus</i> to enjoin respondents-government agencies to comply with their duties to protect and preserve the marine environment, as allegedly provided under the provisions of Republic Act No. 8550, or the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As it turns out, petitioners decided to withdraw the action they filed. I concur with the majority in granting the motion to withdraw petition and considering the case dismissed without passing upon any of the issues raised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>I submit this Opinion, however, to remind that the <i>ponencia's</i> pronouncement that "[b]efore any private parties or public interest groups proceed with the case, they must already be ready with the <b>evidence</b> necessary for the determination of [the writ's] issuance"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> should be read in light of the Court's ruling in <i>Gios-Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communication</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>While the Court shares original and concurrent jurisdiction with the Courc of Appeals (over actions seeking the issuance of writs of <i>kalikasan</i> and continuing <i>mandamus</i>) and the Regional Trial Courts (for petitions for writs of continuing <i>mandamus</i> only), petitioners must still observe the rule on hierarchy of courts and seek immediate resort with this Court only to resolve pure questions of law. As this case demonstrates, a proceeding for the issuance of writs of <i>kalikasan</i> and continuing <i>mandamus</i> necessarily involves the evaluation of evidence and resolution of factual questions which this Court is not wont to undertake. To reiterate, this Court is not a trier of facts. We are unsuited to receive and evaluate evidence in the first instance; these are the primary functions of the lower courts or regulatory agencies. Thus, and unless the questions involved are purely legal in nature, the doctrine of hierarchy of courts should be observed. To my mind, due process considerations, at the very least, demand that such matters be first and fully presented before a trier of fact, fully equipped to receive and evaluate evidence in the first instance.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> See Permanent Court Arbitration Press Release, July 12, 2016 &lt;<a href="http://https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1801">https://pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1801</a>&gt; (visited July 9, 2019); Panda, International Court Issues Unanimous Award in Philippines v.
