				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Like courts, administrative boards and officers vested with quasi-­judicial power may only exercise jurisdiction over matters that their enabling statutes confer in them. This rule applies even though the parties hold out to the administrative agency concerned that it has jurisdiction over a particular dispute. Generally, lack of jurisdiction may be raised at any time, and is a defense that cannot be lost. However, by way of narrow exception, the doctrine of estoppel by laches, which rests on considerations of public policy, may effectively bar jurisdictional challenges. But it must be emphasized that the doctrine finds application only where the jurisdictional issue is so belatedly raised that it may be presumed o have been waived by the invoking party.</i><br><br>This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> questioning the May 26, 2017 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the August 30, 2017 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> rendered by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

Palanca</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> instructs that a court, in order to validly try a civil case, must be possessed of two types of jurisdiction: (1) jurisdiction over the subject matter; and (2) jurisdiction over the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Relevant to the resolution of the issue raised in this case is the first, which, broadly defined, is "the power to hear and determine the general class to which the proceedings in question belong"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> or, in the words of <i>Palanca</i>, "the authority of the court to entertain a particular kind of action or to administer a particular kind of relief."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Emanating from the sovereign authority that organizes courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law.

Honda Cars Technical Specialist and Supervisors Union</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court ruled that VAs have no competence to rule on the propriety of withholding of tax. That case concerned the withholding of income tax from union members relative to unused gasoline allowance. The company claimed that the benefit was tied up to a similar company policy enjoyed by managers and assistant vice-presidents, who were allowed to convert the unutilized portion of their monthly gasoline allowance into cash, subject to whatever tax may be applicable. Since the union and the company could not agree on the proper tax treatment of the converted allowance, the dispute was submitted to a Panel of VAs. In the arbitration proceedings, it was held that the company's act of withholding was improper since the cash conversion was not subject to income tax. When the case eventually reached the Court, the panel's decision was declared null and void on the ground that VAs have no jurisdiction to settle tax matters. Ruling that the jurisdiction of VAs is limited to labor disputes, the Court declared that the company and the union should have submitted the question to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The [VA] has no competence to rule on the taxability of the gas allowance and on the propriety of the withholding of tax. These issues are clearly tax matters, and do not involve labor disputes. To be exact, they involve tax issues within a labor relations setting, as they pertain to questions of law on the application of Section 33 (A) of the [Tax Code]. They do not require the application of the Labor Code or the interpretation of the [Memorandum of Agreement] and/or company personnel policies. Furthermore, the company and the union cannot agree or compromise on the taxability of the gas allowance. Taxation is the State's inherent power; its imposition cannot be subject to the will of the parties.<br><br>Under paragraph 1, Section 4 of the [Tax Code], the CIR shall have the exclusive and original jurisdiction to interpret the provisions of the [Tax Code] and other tax laws, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance. Consequently, if the company and/or the union desire/s to seek clarification of these issues, it/they should have requested for a tax ruling from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>On the other hand, if the union disputes the withholding of tax and desires a refund of the withheld tax, it should have filed an administrative claim for refund with the CIR. Paragraph 2, Section 4 of the [Tax Code] expressly vests the CIR original jurisdiction over refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other tax matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><i>Honda Cars</i> espouses a sound view. The <i>ponencia</i> recognized that the jurisdiction of an administrative body must be confined to matters within its specialized competence. Since the withholding of tax from employees' salaries is governed by the Tax Code, disputes involving the propriety or legality of withholding should be submitted to the CIR, the administrative body vested with the power to interpret tax laws, and not the VA, whose jurisdiction is limited to labor disputes. After all, quasi-judicial bodies only possess jurisdiction over matters that are conferred upon them by their enabling statutes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Turning now to VMCEU's arguments, did VMC's execution of the Submission Agreement and active participation in the arbitration proceedings operate to rectify the VA's lack of jurisdiction?<br><br>Again, the answer is in the negative.<br><br>As mentioned above, jurisdiction is conferred by law. As a result, absent a statutory grant, the actions, representations, declarations, or omissions of a party will not serve to vest jurisdiction over the subject matter in a court, board, or officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Simply put, "judicial or quasi-judicial jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a tribunal by the parties alone."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> As the Court explained in <i>La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x Whenever it appears that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the action shall be dismissed. This defense may be interposed at any time, during appeal or even after final judgment. Such is understandable, as this kind of jurisdiction is conferred by law and not within the courts, let alone the parties, to themselves determine or conveniently set aside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>At this juncture, it should be stated that lack of jurisdiction is a serious defect that may be raised anytime, even for the first time on appeal, since it is a defense that is not subject to waiver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>However, by way of exception, the doctrine of estoppel by laches, pursuant to the ruling in <i>Tijam, et al. v. Sibonghanoy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> may operate to bar jurisdictional challenges. In that case, lack of jurisdiction was raised for the first time only in a motion for reconsideration filed before the CA fifteen (15) years after the commencement of the action. Prior thereto, the party that belatedly raised the jurisdictional issue had actively participated in the proceedings before the trial and appellate courts, seeking affirmative relief and, thereafter, submitting the case for adjudication on the merits. Based on public policy considerations, it was ruled that jurisdiction could no longer be questioned. The Court held that no tolerance should be afforded to the practice of submitting a case for resolution, only to accept a favorable judgment, and to raise a jurisdictional issue in case of a decision that is adverse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Estoppel by laches has been broadly defined as "failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As applied to jurisdictional challenges, it is the failure to timely raise a court's lack of jurisdiction, ultimately resulting in a binding judgment, not because said judgment is valid as an adjudication, but because public policy looks with disfavor on the belated invocation of jurisdictional issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding the unequivocal dictum in <i>Sibonghanoy</i>, it must be emphasized that the general rule remains to be that jurisdiction is not to be left to the will or stipulation of the parties; it cannot be lost by estoppel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Such emphasis is called for because, as the Court pointed out in <i>Calimlim, et al. v. Hon. Ramirez, etc., et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> a jurisprudential trend was starting to emerge where estoppel was applied to bar jurisdictional challenges even in situations not contemplated by <i>Sibonghanoy</i>. Consequently, <i>Figueroa v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> sought to elucidate on the proper application of <i>Sibonghanoy</i>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The Court, thus, wavered on when to apply the exceptional circumstance in <i>Sibonghanoy</i> and on when to apply the general rule x x x expounded at length in <i>Calimlim</i>. The general rule should, however, be, as it has always been, that the issue of jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal, and is not lost by waiver or by estoppel. Estoppel by laches, to bar a litigant from asserting the court's absence or lack of jurisdiction, only supervenes in exceptional cases similar to the factual milieu of [Sibonghanoy]. Indeed, the fact that a person attempts to invoke unauthorized jurisdiction of a court does not estop him from thereafter challenging its jurisdiction over the subject matter, since such jurisdiction must arise by law and not by mere consent of the parties. This is especially true where the person seeking to invoke unauthorized jurisdiction of the court does not thereby secure any advantage or the adverse party does not suffer any harm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The above pronouncement was more recently reiterated in <i>Adlawan v. Joaquino, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>We emphasize that our ruling in <i>Sibonghanoy</i> establishes an exception which is to be applied only under extraordinary circumstances or to those cases similar to its factual situation. The rule to be followed is that the lack of a court's jurisdiction is a non-waivable defense that a party can raise at any stage of the proceedings in a case, even on appeal; the doctrine of estoppel, being the exception to such non-waivable defense, must be applied with great care and the equity must be strong in its favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Taking the foregoing into account, it is clear that estoppel will not operate to confer jurisdiction upon a court, save in the most exceptional of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Without a law that grants the power to hear, try, and decide a particular type of action, a court may not, regardless of what the parties do or fail to do, afford any sort of relief in any such action filed before it. It follows then that, in those cases, any judgment or order other than one of dismissal is void for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This must be the rule since no less than the Constitution provides that it is a function of the Congress to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Nevertheless, jurisprudence has recognized that situations may arise where parties, as a matter of public policy, must be bound by judgments rendered even without jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Such situations, however, are exceptional, and courts must exercise the highest degree of caution in their application of estoppel to bar jurisdictional challenges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> That said, where the circumstances of a particular case are comparable to those attendant in <i>Sibonghanoy</i>, jurisdictional issues may no longer be entertained, and the doctrine of estoppel by laches will effectively bind the parties to the judgment rendered therein regardless of whether the dispensing court was vested with jurisdiction by statute. In such situations, lack of jurisdiction must be invoked so belatedly so as to give rise to "a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The rule that estops a party from assailing the jurisdiction of a court finds like application in proceedings before administrative boards and officers that possess quasi-judicial power. This approach is sensible, as no germane differences exist between such bodies, on one hand, and courts, on the other, when it comes to belated jurisdictional challenges. It cannot be gainsaid that it is just as deplorable to tardily raise a jurisdictional issue before a court as it is to do so before an administrative tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, the Court must apply the preceding tenets to the case at bar.<br><br>Here, the Court cannot conclude that VMC was estopped from assailing the VA's jurisdiction.<br><br>First, lack of jurisdiction was timely raised. The record discloses that (1) the proceedings before the VA commenced with the execution of the Submission Agreement dated August 7, 2015;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and (2) the case was submitted for resolution on December 22, 2015, when VMC and VMCEU filed their respective replies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> As soon as the VA rendered his Decision on May 26, 2016,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the company, through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> dated July 18, 2016,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> immediately raised the jurisdictional issue before the CA. To be sure, not even a year had elapsed between the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and the invocation of the jurisdictional issue. By no stretch of the imagination can this be compared to the factual milieu of <i>Sibonghanoy</i>, where lack of jurisdiction was raised only 15 years after the case was filed. Hence, the temporal element of estoppel by laches vis-a-vis jurisdiction does not obtain in the case at bar.<br><br>Second, VMC never prayed for affirmative relief. In <i>Sibonghanoy</i>, the party that raised lack of jurisdiction, a bonding company, prayed that it be relieved of its liability under the bond subject of that case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> On the other hand, VMC, in the position paper that it filed before the VA, merely prayed that "the complaint of [VMCEU] be dismissed with prejudice for utter lack of merit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Since all the company sought was the dismissal of the union's complaint, the former's prayer cannot be considered as one seeking affirmative relief.<br><br>Taking the foregoing into account, the public policy considerations attendant in <i>Sibonghanoy</i> find no application here so as to estop VMC from questioning the VA's jurisdiction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the May 26, 2017 Decision and August 30, 2017 Resolution rendered by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
