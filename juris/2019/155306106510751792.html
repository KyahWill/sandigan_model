				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this appeal is the October 30, 2015 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 06077 which affirmed the April 3, 2013 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 197, Las Piñas City, finding Joenil Pin Molde (appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified theft.<br><br><b><i>The Antecedent Facts</i></b><br><br>Appellant was charged with the crime of qualified theft under Article 310, in relation to Article 308, of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in an Information which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 26<sup>th</sup> day of May 2010, in the City of Las Piñas, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, being then the former ACCOUNTING IN CHARGE of SUN PRIDE FOODS INC. Las Piñas City branch, herein represented by: complainant HENRY DY, and as such he has custody of all the cash collections and checks of the said company and enjoying the trust and confidence reposed upon him by said complainant, with intent to gain and without the knowledge and consent of the latter and with grave abuse of confidence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away cash money amounting to Php1,149,960.56, belonging to the said SUN PRIDE FOODS INC. herein represented by: HENRY DY, to the damage and prejudice of the latter in the total amount of Php1,149,960.56.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>During his arraignment on November 15, 2010, appellant entered a plea of not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>The prosecution's version of the incident is as follows:<br><br>Appellant was hired as an office clerk by Sun Pride Foods, Inc. (Sun Pride) in 2006. In February 2008, he was assigned to the company's Las Piñas Branch as the "accounting-in-charge".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> As such, appellant had custody over the cash and check collections of sales agents as well as the Weekly Remittance Transmittal Reports (WRTR) submitted by them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In particular, he was in-charge of depositing the cash payments in Sun Pride's account with the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), and sending the checks issued as payments for Sun Pride to its main office in Cebu City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 2010, Grace Maquiling, the overall head of accounting of Sun Pride, ordered an investigation with regard the low cash remittances from the company's Las Piñas Branch. After the audit conducted by Mariano Victorillo (Victorillo), Sun Pride's internal auditor, it was discovered that the total amount unremitted to Sun Pride had ballooned to P1,149,960.56, comprising of P757,998.35 in cash and P391,962.21 in checks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After furnishing appellant with a copy of the audit report, Sun Pride sent two demand letters requiring the former to pay the total unremitted amount but to no avail. Sun Pride eventually suspended appellant from work pending investigation. For his part, appellant stopped reporting to work after tendering his letter of resignation despite Sun Pride's refusal to accept said letter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant denied the allegations against him. He testified that:<br><br>While [he] received check payments, the checks were payable to [Sun Pride] Foods, Inc., and he was not authorized to encash the same. Also, the BPI bank deposit slips he received were from the sales agents, who deposit their cash collections directly to the bank. Copies of the deposit slips were submitted to him to be attached to the WRTR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated April 3, 2013, the RTC found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified theft.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It held that:<br><blockquote>[A]s Accounting-In-Charge of [Sun Pride) in its branch in Las Piñas City, [appellant] was authorized to receive collections and payments from sales agents and walk-in customers of [Sun Pride). [Appellant] was able to perpetrate the crime, using the trust and confidence reposed upon him by [Sun Pride], by his failure to remit all collections [that] he received. To reiterate, [the] audit report of [Sun Pride's] internal audit showed that [appellant] unlawfully took the amount of Php1,149,960.56 belonging to [Sun Pride.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>The defense of denial advanced by [appellant] that he did not receive cash collections from [Sun Pride's] sales agents cannot overcome the positive declaration of the prosecution[']s witnesses, particularly [S]ales [A]gents Remogat and Tigson that they directly remitted their cash collection to [appellant.] The audit report showing the unremitted amount supports and bolsters the claim of the sales agents. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced appellant to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay Sun Pride the amounts of P1,149,960.56, representing the stolen funds, and P458,863.48 as attorney's fees and other litigation expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellant thereafter appealed the RTC Decision before the CA.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision dated October 30, 2015, the CA affirmed the assailed RTC Decision <i>in toto</i>. It upheld the RTC's findings that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The CA further noted that appellant's denial of the allegations against him was merely a desperate attempt to exculpate himself from liability, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Notably, initially[,] [appellant] on cross-examination x x x had acknowledged that he received the cash and checks. Later, [appellant] on cross-examination x x x claimed that he did not receive the cash collections and checks. This denial (after initially admitting receipt [thereof]) was a desperate attempt to exculpate himself from liability and an intrinsically weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility. [Appellant] did not adduce any such strong evidence to support his claim that he did not receive such cash collections and checks. Bare denials cannot overcome the positive testimonies of private complainant Sun Pride's sales agents that they turned over the cash collections and checks to [appellant]. The defense that [appellant] did not receive the cash and checks was a mere afterthought, in a desperate attempt to escape criminal liability for the crime he committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, appellant filed the present appeal.<br><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>Appellant raises the sole issue of whether his guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt, considering the prosecution's failure to present evidence that he indeed pocketed the missing cash and check remittances from Sun Pride in the total amount of P1,149,960.56.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The elements of qualified theft are: "(<i>a</i>) taking of personal property; (<i>b</i>) that the said property belongs to 'another; (<i>c</i>) that the said taking be done with intent to gain; (<i>d</i>) that it be done without the owner's consent; (<i>e</i>) that it be accomplished without the use of violence or intimidation against persons, nor of force upon things; [and] (<i>f</i>) that it be done with grave abuse of confidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After a thorough review of the records, we find that the prosecution miserably failed to establish the elements of the crime of qualified theft. The prosecution failed to prove the crucial elements of <i>taking of personal property</i> and <i>intent to gain</i> on the part of appellant.<br><br>For one thing, the subject checks were issued <i>payable to Sun Pride</i>; hence, appellant could not have possibly presented said checks to the drawee bank for encashment for his own personal gain. This fact was confirmed by Sun Pride's own internal auditor, Victorillo, who testified that:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[ATTY.

This matter was exhaustively discussed by the defense during appellant's direct examination, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[ATTY.

The supposed acknowledgment receipts proving that appellant actually received cash and check remittances from Sun Pride's sales agents had mysteriously gone missing and could not be located in any of the company's offices. For clarity, the pertinent portion of Victorillo's testimony is quoted below:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">There was no document to show that indeed [appellant] received the remittances from the agents?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">There was[,] your honor, but the same is missing in our office.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Did you not ask the respective agents who [were] in possession of the documents that indeed the accused received the same?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">I asked the agents, your h nor[,] but their copies were missing in the office.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Why is it that they were missing in the office?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><p align="justify">When I asked from the agent the WRTR (transmittal report) and they look[ed] [for] the same [inside] their drawers but the same was missing[,] your honor.</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Drawers of whom?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Of their own drawers[,] your honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Drawers of the respective agents?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes[,] your honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td><div align="justify">Those acknowledgment receipt[s] signed by [appellant] were lost while inside the respective drawers of the agents?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: </div></td><td><div align="justify">[Maybe,] your honor.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q: <strong></strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>You just presumed about the allegation or claim of agents that they remitted the amount, without proving that the [appellant] received the amount?</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A: <strong></strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>Yes[,] your honor.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The totality of these circumstances leads us to inevitably conclude that the elements of <i>taking of personal property with intent to gain</i> were not proven beyond reasonable doubt.
