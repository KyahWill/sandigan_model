Unfortunately,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; Deguidoy's&nbsp;&nbsp; sales&nbsp; performance&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; Tutuban branch was very meager compared to that of the branch top performer, and consisted of a small contribution to t&nbsp; e total branch output.&nbsp; This was based onAAI's records.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In&nbsp; addition&nbsp; to&nbsp; her&nbsp; low&nbsp; sales&nbsp; output,&nbsp; Deguidoy&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp; found&nbsp; to&nbsp; have incurred numerous&nbsp; unexplained&nbsp; absences.&nbsp; She failed to report for work for a total&nbsp; of 29&nbsp; days&nbsp; within&nbsp; a six-month&nbsp; period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From&nbsp; 2009&nbsp; until&nbsp; 2013,&nbsp; AAI issued various notices requiring her to explain, which she ignored.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>It becomes&nbsp; all too apparent&nbsp; that AAI's&nbsp; decision&nbsp; to transfer&nbsp; Deguidoy to the Ortigas branch was triggered&nbsp; by the need to streamline&nbsp; its operations. The Tutuban branch needed manpower, whose functions Deguidoy could not fulfill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile,&nbsp; the Ortigas&nbsp; branch was frequented&nbsp; by less.er customers, and&nbsp;&nbsp; was&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp; need&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; additional&nbsp;&nbsp; personnel,&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; Deguidoy&nbsp;&nbsp; could adequately respond.&nbsp; In fact, the re-assignment&nbsp; was viewed as a means to aid her increase her sales target.<br><br>Similar to the instant case, in Peckson,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court respected the management's decision&nbsp; to transfer&nbsp; its recalcitrant&nbsp; employee&nbsp; who was habitually tardy and inconsistent&nbsp; in attendance to a branch that would be less affected by her laziness.&nbsp; The Court explained:<br><blockquote>As a privilege inherent in the employer's right to control and manage its&nbsp; enterprise effectively, its&nbsp; freedom to&nbsp; conduct its&nbsp; business operations to achieve its purpose cannot be denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with the appellate court that the respondents are justified in moving the petitioner to another equivalent position, which presumably would be less affected by her habitual tardiness or inconsistent attendance than if she continued as a Category Buyer, a "frontline position" in the day-to-day business operations of a supermarket such as Robinsons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Equally&nbsp; important,&nbsp; in <i>Benguet Electric Cooperative v.

On the contrary,&nbsp; it&nbsp; even&nbsp; sought&nbsp; ways&nbsp; to&nbsp; help improve&nbsp; her&nbsp; performance&nbsp; at&nbsp; the Tutuban branch.&nbsp; The management cal ed Deguidoy's attention to discuss the reasons behind her dismal sales performance. Instead of imposing sanctions, the management even offered to give&nbsp;&nbsp; her counseling.&nbsp; During the counseling sessions,&nbsp; Deguidoy&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; that&nbsp; h r&nbsp; poor&nbsp; performance&nbsp; was due&nbsp; to her weight gain which rendered it difficult for her to stand and perform her tasks as a sales coordinator.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>This was supported by her medical records.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Medical&nbsp; Certificate&nbsp; dated&nbsp; March&nbsp; 2,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 011 showed&nbsp; that&nbsp; she then&nbsp; weighed 151.8 pounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; A later Medical Examination Report dated June 18, 2014 confirmed that her weight ballooned t&nbsp;&nbsp; 176 pounds.&nbsp; Deguidoy stands at four feet and eight inches (4'8").&nbsp;&nbsp; As a solution, the management offered her a lateral transfer as a receptionist clerk or invoicing clerk, where she would not need to stand for prolonged period&nbsp; of time. However, Deguidoy refused the offer and promised to improve her&nbsp;&nbsp; performance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The&nbsp; aforementioned&nbsp; reports&nbsp; likewise show that the CA erred in opining that there was no truth to AAI’s purported claim that Deguidoy’s weight gain affected her performance at work.
