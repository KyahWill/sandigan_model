Two (2) of them alighted from the motorcycle, one went in front of Michael and Alma and urinated along the banks of the lake, while the other went behind a coconut tree nearby. The former then told his companions, "pare, tawagan natin si pare." One of his companions replied, "siguro'y tulog na pero tawagan na din natin."<br><br>Ten minutes later, the man who urinated suddenly approached Alma and pointed a knife to her neck. Likewise, the person who hid behind the coconut tree approached Michael and pointed a knife at him. The men then announced, "holdap ito ilabas na ninyo ang inyong cellphone pera at alahas at hindi kayo mamamatay wag lang kayong maingay."<br><br>Thereafter, the person who stayed at the motorcycle approached Michael and Alma, brandishing a "<i>kawit</i>." Michael cried for help and attempted to fight. The three men however, repeatedly stabbed Michael until he slumped on the ground lifeless. Alma sought help but nobody came to help them. After stabbing Michael, the three persons scampered away, prompting Alma to once again ask for help. Minutes later, a mobile patrol arrived. Michael was brought to Ace Funeral Homes where he was pronounced dead.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>As for the version of the defense:<br><blockquote>On the other hand, accused-appellants denied the charges against them and interposed their respective alibis.<br><br>Maron, a construction worker, testified that in the evening of 4 January 2010, he was at their house at Brgy.

He testified that on 4 January 2010, at around 7:00 p.m., he and his two children were at their house located near Brion Subdivision, Brgy. San Lucas I, San Pablo City. After dinner, they went to bed and rested. At around 10:00 a.m. of the following day, while he was taking a bath, five police officers led by PO2 Sacdalan went to the house, handcuffed and arrested him. He was then brought to the police station where he was told to stand in a police line-up.

The next day, he went to work at 6:00 a.m. At around 10:00 a.m. of 5 January 2010, several policemen arrived and arrested him. He was brought to a police van where he saw Almario, Maron, his wife and a certain Pale.

Enriquez</i>, Jr.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court explained that, "(t)here is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means and methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend to directly and specially ensure its execution x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Further, "(t)he essence of treachery is the sudden and unexpected attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring its commission without risk of himself."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In order for treachery to quality murder, the following elements must be established: (1) the assailant employed means, methods or forms in the execution of the criminal act which give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to retaliate; and (2) said means, methods or forms of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted by the assailant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Thus, it is not enough for the prosecution to show that the attack was sudden, unexpected and without warning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Rather, there must be a showing that the mode of attack was consciously adopted and that the accused made "some preparation to kill the deceased in a manner as to insure the execution of the crime or to make it impossible or hard for the person attacked to defend himself or retaliate."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Here, the RTC and the CA erroneously ruled that the killing of Michael was attended by treachery. It cannot be said that Michael did not expect that he would be stabbed by appellants since the latter already announced "hold-up" while Maron and Bulahan were poking their knives at Alma and Michael, and while Almario was brandishing his <i>kawit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> in front of them. Michael also had the opportunity to shout for help.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Further, there is no showing that appellants made some preparations to kill Michael in the said manner since Alma's testimony shows that appellants originally planned to rob them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>However, the Court finds that appellants are still guilty of murder since the killing of Michael was a tended by the qualifying circumstance of employing means to weaken the defense.<br><br>Employing means to weaken the defense as a qualifying circumstance in murder is also found under Article 14(15) of the RPC as an aggravating circumstance, to wit:<br><blockquote>Art. 14. <i>Aggravating circumstances</i>. - The following are aggravating circumstances:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>15. That advantage be taken of superior strength, or means be employed to weaken the defense.<br></blockquote>In <i>People v. Revillame</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court quoted <i>People v. Cabiling</i> (<i>Cabiling</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which in turn explained and adopted Cuello Calon's view on the appreciation of abuse of superior strength or employing means to weaken the defense. The Court in <i>Cabiling</i> discussed:<br><blockquote>To take advantage of superior strength means to purposely use excessive force out of proportion to the means of the defense available to the person attacked. According to Cuello Calon, it is: "'<i>Abuse of superior numbers or employment of means to weaken the defense</i>' (art. 10, 8.a.). This circumstance greatly resembles <i>alevosia</i> when placed in a situation of advantage over those on whom it is employed, such that one is confused for the other. This circumstance should always be considered whenever there is a <i>notorious inequality of forces</i> between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime. To properly appreciate it, not only is it necessary to evaluate the physical conditions of the protagonists of opposing forces and the arms or objects employed by both sides, but it is also necessary to analyze the incidents and episodes constituting the development of the event. There is no need for previous agreement among the aggressors." Thus in <i>People v. Verzo</i>, this Court held that there was abuse of superior strength which qualified the killing where three of the defendants were wielding bolos, whereas the victim was unarmed and trying to flee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Further, in <i>People v. Loreto</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the Court ruled that there are no fixed and invariable rules regarding abuse of superior strength or employing means to weaken the defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The Court explained:<br><blockquote>x x x Article 14, paragraph 15 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a crime against persons is aggravated by the accused taking advantage of superior strength. <i>There are no fixed and invariable rules regarding abuse of superior strength or employing means to weaken the defense of the victim.</i> Superiority does not always mean numerical superiority. Abuse of superiority depends upon the relative strength of the aggressor <i>vis-a-vis</i> the victim. There is abuse of superior strength even if there is only one malefactor and one victim. <i>Abuse of superiority is determined by the excess of the aggressor's natural strength over that of the victim, considering the position of both and the employment of means to weaken the defense</i>, although not annulling it. The aggressor must have advantage of his natural strength to insure the commission of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Following the discussion of Cuello Calon in <i>Cabiling</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> abuse of superior strength and employment of means are taken as one and the same aggravating circumstance. Further, it appears that employment of means to weaken the defense is, at the very least, subsumed under the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.<br><br>Thus, in determining whether the qualifying circumstance of employing means to weaken the defense is present in this case the Court shall be guided by the same standard in determining the presence of abuse of superior strength, <i>i.e.</i>, "notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor/s that is plainly and obviously advantageous to the aggressor's and purposely selected or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the crime."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Here, Alma's testimony is clear as to how appellants stabbed Michael successively using their respective weapons. The fact that Michael was unarmed, that he as ganged up by appellants, and that the latter were equipped with and took advantage of their respective knives and <i>kawit</i> in inflicting fatal wounds on Michael, show a notorious inequality of forces which was obviously advantageous to the appellants.<br><br>Anent the penalty, the Court finds the CA's imposition of the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> correct. However, there is a need to clarify the basis for the penalty because the CA erroneously awarded civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00 each.<br><br>In <i>People v. Jugueta</i> (<i>Jugueta</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the rule is that civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to be awarded shall be P100,000.00. each where the penalty imposed is death but reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> because of Republic Act No. 9346, otherwise known as "An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Here, as discussed above, treachery should not be appreciated anymore as an aggravating circumstance. But with the appreciation of the qualifying circumstance of employing means to weaken the defense of the victim, the crime committed is Murder. Thus, in the absence of any aggravating circumstance, the penalty that must be imposed on the appellants is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and not death. Following <i>Jugueta</i>, the award of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, where the penalty imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> other than the above-stated rule, should be P75,000.00 each.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>There is also a need to modify the loss of earning capacity which is computed as follows:<br><blockquote>Net Earning Capacity = Life expectancy x [Gross Annual Income - Living Expenses]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = [2/3 (80 - age at death)] x [GAI Â­ [50% of GAI]]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Michael's Contract of Employment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> shows that he was supposed to work for six days a week and eight hours per day. Thus, Michael's gross income should be computed by multiplying his daily wage of P293.00 by 24 days, the number of days Michael is working per month. The resulting gross income per month, <i>i.e.</i>, P7,032.00, shall then be multiplied by 12 to get the annual gross income which is P84,384.00.<br><br>Using the settled formula, Michael's loss of earning capacity is P1,490,784.00, computed as follows:<br><blockquote>Net Earning Capacity = Life expectancy x [Gross Annual Income - Living Expenses]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = [2/3 (80 - age at death)] x [GAI - [50% of GAI]]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = [2/3 (80 - 27)] x P84,384-P42,192<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = [2/3 (53)] x P42, 192.00<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = <b>P1,490,784.00</b><br></blockquote>Lastly, the Court affirms the award of actual or compensatory damages in the amount of P54,000.00 since this amount is based on the Funeral Contract of Gliceria Clarianes, Michael's wife, with Ace Funeral Homes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the Decision dated September 5, 2016 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
