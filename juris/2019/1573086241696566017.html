It contended that by executing said contract, respondents effectively vacated their right to the judgment awards under the NLRC Decision including the reinstatement aspect, and instead agreed to novate petitioner's obligation into a simple monetary obligation which was fully satisfied upon payment of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On March 31, 2014, the NLRC issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> denying respondents' motion for reconsideration, ruling that the questioned quitclaims were in order having been subscribed and sworn to before a Notary Public, and that they were paid their full monetary judgment award.

It pointed out that quitclaims are ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of a worker's legal rights when; (<i>a</i>) there is clear proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person; or (<i>b</i>) the terms of settlement are unconscionable on their face. Since petitioner failed to establish that the settlement award is credible and reasonable as against what respondents should have received as an illegally dismissed employee, and considering further that the latter have repeatedly demanded for their reinstatement even after the execution of their respective quitclaims, the CA held that the acceptance by respondents of the benefits as consideration of the quitclaim did not amount to a waiver of what were legally due them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA committed any reversible error in: (<i>a</i>) holding that the questioned Quitclaims and Releases were invalid; and (<i>b</i>) ordering the remand of the case to the NLRC for re-computation of respondents' backwages until their actual reinstatement, or to pay separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">"To justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i>, petitioners must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon it. Grave abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. To be considered 'grave,' discretion must be exercised in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>"In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when, <i>inter alia</i>, its findings and the conclusions reached thereby are not supported by substantial evidence. This requirement of substantial evidence is clearly expressed in Section 5, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court which provides that '[i]n cases filed before administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, a fact may be deemed established if it is supported by substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA correctly granted respondents' <i>certiorari</i> petition since the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in <u><b><i>completely</i></b></u> discharging petitioner from its obligations under a final and executory judgment in view of the Quitclaim and Release executed by respondents. In particular, as will be explained below, petitioner should not be discharged from its obligation to reinstate respondents since the Quitclaim and Release only settled the backwages aspect of petitioner's judgment debt.<br><br>At the outset, quitclaims are contracts in the nature of a <i>compromise</i> where parties make concessions, a lawful device to <i>avoid litigation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It is a valid and binding agreement between the parties, provided that it constitutes a credible and <i>reasonable settlement</i> and the one accomplishing it has done so voluntarily and with a full understanding of its import.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In so doing, the parties adjust their difficulties in the manner they have agreed upon, disregarding the possible gain in litigation and keeping in mind that such gain is balanced by the danger of losing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> While quitclaims are generally intended for the purpose of preventing or putting an end to a lawsuit, jurisprudence nonetheless holds that the parties are not precluded from entering into a compromise even if a final judgment had already been rendered,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> as in this case. As pointed out in <i>Magbanua v. Uy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59] </sup>"[t]here is no justification to disallow a compromise agreement, solely because it was entered into after final judgment. The validity of the agreement is determined by compliance with the requisites and principles of contracts, not by when it was entered into."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>For a deed of release, waiver, and quitclaim to be valid, it must be shown that: (<i>a</i>) there was no fraud or deceit on the part, of any parties; (<i>b</i>) that the consideration for the quitclaim is credible and reasonable; and (<i>c</i>) that the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The burden rests on the employer to prove that the quitclaim constitutes a <u>credible and reasonable settlement</u> of what an employee is entitled to recover, and that the one accomplishing it has done so <u>voluntarily and with a full understanding of its import</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>As culled from the records, it is not disputed that the <b>NLRC Decision had already become <u>final and executory</u></b>, declaring respondents to have been illegally dismissed, and accordingly, ordered petitioner to: <b>(<i>a</i>) pay respondents their unpaid 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, backwages in accordance with Article 294 of the Labor Code, and attorney's fees (monetary aspect); and (<i>b</i>) reinstate respondents or pay their separation pay should reinstatement be no longer viable (reinstatement aspect)</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> It is likewise not denied that respondents immediately sought for the enforcement of the foregoing final and executory NLRC Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> in their letters dated February 1, 2013 and March 14, 2013.<br><br>However, records disclose that petitioner was only able to partly comply with the NLRC Decision by paying respondents Galandez and Sajuela the amount of P123,230.25 each, and Namoc the sum of P116,587.18, <b>representing their backwages, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and attorney's fees as provisionally computed by the NLRC as of July 17, 2012</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thereafter, respondents executed a Quitclaim and Release in favor of petitioner acknowledging payment, which pertinently reads:<br><blockquote>THAT I,___________ , his/her successors and assigns, for and in consideration of the sum of_____________ (P________) to his/her in hand paid, the receipts of which is hereby acknowledge, does hereby release and discharged F.F. CRUZ &amp; CO., INC., their successors and assigns, from any and all manner of claims, demand, damages, causes of action or suits that he/she may now have, or that might subsequently occur to his/her by reason of any matter or things whatsoever, and particularly growing out or in any way connected with her employment with F.F. CRUZ &amp; CO. INC.<br><br>It is the purpose of this release to forever settle, adjust and discharge all claims of whatsoever kind of nature that the undersigned has or may have against the parties here to mention.<br></blockquote>Petitioner insists that the amount received by respondents represent the full settlement of their claims, and that they had agreed to waive not only their right to reinstatement but also to the additional backwages that would have accrued up until the time they are reinstated (additional backwages).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> To be sure, the latter claim proceeds from the dictum that "for as long as the employer continuously fails to actually implement the reinstatement aspect of the decision x x x, the employer's <u>obligation to the employee for his accrued backwages and other benefits continues to accumulate</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees that respondents waived their right to be reinstated, but agrees on the waiver of the additional backwages.<br><br>Other than petitioner's bare assertion, there is no showing that respondents intended to freely and voluntarily waive their right to reinstatement under the said quitclaim. <b>In fact, respondents had consistently averred that the afore-mentioned quitclaims were executed <u>with the assurance that petitioner would reinstate them as decreed in the NLRC's final judgment</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> <b><i>It bears stressing that in determining the intention of parties to a contract, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> For this reason, in <i>Solgus Corporation v. CA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Court ruled that quitclaims and waivers should be carefully examined and strictly scrutinized with regard not only to the words and terms used, but also to the <i>factual circumstances</i> under which they have been executed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Thus, as respondents executed the quitclaim in consideration of, among others, petitioner's promise of reinstatement as evinced by their contemporaneous and subsequent acts, then the said contract must be interpreted accordingly.<br><br>Notably, this conclusion holds true notwithstanding the absence of any express clause therefor in the Quitclaim and Release. This is because the said document is ambiguous as to whether or not, in fact, the decreed reinstatement has been waived. The phrase "all claims of whatsoever kind of nature" is a general, standard clause in most employee quitclaims that cannot be construed in its strict literal sense in light of this case's peculiarities. In this relation, the Court deems it apt to state that "[t]he interpretation of obscure words or stipulations in a contract shall not favor the party who caused the obscurity,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> as petitioner in this case who prepared the quitclaim form.<br><br>On the other hand, with respect to the monetary aspect, records do not show that respondents made the same insistence anent their right to additional backwages. In fact, records fail to disclose that: (<i>a</i>) any promise of such nature was made; or (<i>b</i>) respondents further demanded any additional monetary amount after they were paid the above-stated sums upon their signing of the Quitclaim and Release. This clearly demonstrates that respondents had voluntarily accepted the said amounts to serve as a complete settlement of the monetary aspect of the NLRC Decision.<br><br>Indeed, as the Court discerns, the consideration, therefore, for respondents in acceding to the Quitclaim and Release was to realize the expeditious settlement of petitioner's monetary obligations (13<sup>th</sup> month pay, backwages, and attorney's fees), without, however, compromising their right to get back their jobs and continue to earn a living in petitioner's employ (reinstatement aspect). To the Court, this is the evident intent of the parties as may be gathered from their contemporaneous and subsequent acts. To hold otherwise — that is, to construe the Quitclaim and Release as a complete discharge of petitioner's obligations to respondents — would not only be illogical (since why would respondents waive their reinstatement if it was both promised to them and already decreed under a final and executory judgment), it would also prevent the labor quitclaim from being a fair and reasonable agreement between the parties as required by law.<br><br>In fine, the CA correctly ruled that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in completely relieving petitioner from all of its obligations (both in its monetary and reinstatement aspects) under the final and executory NLRC Decision. Nevertheless, the Court finds it proper to set aside the CA ruling since it altogether rendered ineffective the Quitclaim and Release duly signed by the parties. Cognizant of their intent as explained-above, the Quitclaim and Release remains valid; however, it should be interpreted as a fair and reasonable settlement between the parties only of the monetary aspect of the NLRC Decision, but not of its reinstatement aspect, which hence, should be implemented as a matter of course.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Court is aware that "there may be instances where reinstatement is not a viable remedy or where the relations between the employer and employee have been so severely strained that it is not advisable to order reinstatement, or where the employee decides not to be reinstated. In such events, the employer will instead be ordered to pay separation pay."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Thus, this case must be remanded to the NLRC for a determination of whether or not any of the foregoing instances obtain so as to render reinstatement non-viable and hence, instead order petitioner to pay respondents separation pay, as may be deemed appropriate.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
