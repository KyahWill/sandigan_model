Upon opening the same, appellant immediately asked them how much <i>shabu</i> they were going to buy. IO1 Ilao answered, "worth P1,000.00", and handed to him the marked money. In turn, appellant gave IO1 Ilao one plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance and asked her and the informant to wait as he would repack another sachet of <i>shabu</i> in his room. While waiting, IO1 Ilao "miscalled" IO1 Asayco. When the team barged into the house, a commotion transpired. The PDEA operatives tried to look for appellant at the room where he was supposedly repacking the <i>shabu</i> but they could not find him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Meanwhile, the buy-bust team saw two men<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> using <i>shabu</i> inside appellant's house and arrested them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Afterwards, the buy-bust team proceeded to their office in Tuguegarao City. According to IO1 Ilao, while on their way to their office, she kept custody of the item she bought from appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Upon the other hand, IO1 Asayco and IO1 Sanchez testified that their investigator, SP01 Danilo Natividad (SPO1 Natividad), was in possession of the other seized items since these items were recovered at appellant's house, including the one that appellant sold to IO1 Ilao.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>When the buy-bust team arrived at the PDEA office, IO1 Ilao handed to IO1 Sanchez the sachet of suspected <i>shabu</i> that she bought from appellant.

There was no indication, however, that any representative of the appellant witnessed the inventory of the seized items (considering that appellant escaped arrest). Neither did any elective public official, representatives from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the media sign the inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Likewise, no photograph of the recovered items was attached to the records of the case.<br><br>When she testified in court, IO1 Ilao affirmed that the specimen adduced in evidence was the very subject of the buy-bust operation, and that it was this subject specimen that she and the other members of the PDEA marked at their office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>During the trial, the testimony of Police Senior Inspector Roda Agcaoili (PSI Agcaoili) was dispensed with, as the defense had already admitted the following matters: PSI Agcaoili was an expert witness, she being a forensic chemist at the PNP<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Crime Laboratory; the PDEA had submitted to the Crime Laboratory a Request for the laboratory examination of the specimen subject of the case; per her examination, the specimen gave a positive result for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug; and, she could identify in court the subject specimen as well as her report covering its examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Appellant denied the charge against him. The CA summarized appellant's denial in this manner:<br><blockquote>[Appellant] denied the allegations against him. He was allegedly in the public market of Santiago City at around 1:30 in the afternoon of April 10, 2007. When he returned home, his mother and neighbor informed him that PDEA agents forcibly entered his house. After 10 days, he received a subpoena from the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Santiago City informing him of a criminal case against him.<br><br>[Appellant] testified that he does not know any reason why the PDEA agents filed the case against him and he did not prosecute the PDEA agents for falsely testifying against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i></b><br><br>On November 3, 2013, the RTC rendered its Decision finding appellant guilty as charged. It sentenced him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>According to the RTC, in a buy-bust operation, all that is necessary for conviction for illegal sale of prohibited drug is the accused's (a) receipt of the buy- bust money as payment for the drug and (b) delivery of the illegal drug to the poseur-buyer who paid for it. The RTC held that these twin facts were proven in this case. It further stressed that the escape of appellant during the buy-bust was of no consequence because the actual sale of the illegal drug took place prior to his escape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The RTC also denied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> appellant's motion for reconsideration.<br><br><b><i>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b><br><br>In its Decision of May 24, 2016, the CA affirmed the RTC.<br><br>The CA held that the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drug were satisfactorily established considering that (1) IO1 Ilao purchased from appellant P1,000.00 worth of <i>shabu</i>; (2) appellant gave IO1 Ilao one sachet of <i>shabu</i> and was in the process of repacking another when the rest of the buy-bust team entered into his home and he, in turn, escaped the premises. The CA also ruled that the one sachet of <i>shabu</i> given to IO1 Ilao, which was presented in court, proved that appellant committed illegal sale of dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The CA added that the chain of custody rule was complied with in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, appellant filed this appeal raising the same arguments he presented before the CA. Essentially, he contends that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he committed illegal sale of dangerous drug as there was non- observance of the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The appeal is impressed with merit.<br><br>In an indictment for the illegal sale of <i>shabu</i>, it is absolutely necessary for the prosecution to establish with moral certainty the elements thereof, as well as the <i>corpus delicti</i> or the seized illegal drug. In addition, the chain of custody requirement must be complied with, leaving no lingering doubt that its identity and evidentiary weight had indeed been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>"Chain of custody[, or] the recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs x x x from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping, to presentation in court for destruction,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> is both crucial and critical in convicting an accused for any violation of RA 9165. This much is clear particularly from Section 21 thereof which provides for the procedure governing the custody of seized drug and related items, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments /Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0"

quantities of dangerous drugs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: <i>Provided, however</i>, That a final certification shall be issued on the completed forensic laboratory examination on the same within the next twenty-four (24) hours;</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The Court has repeatedly stressed that it is the prosecution's onus to prove every link in the chain of custody - from the time the drug is seized from the accused, until the time it is presented in court as evidence; and where the prosecution fails to strictly comply with the procedure under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, it must give justifiable ground for its non-compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Generally there are four links in the chain of custody of the seized illegal drug: (i) its seizure and marking, if practicable, from the accused, by the apprehending officer; (ii) its turnover by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; (iii) its turnover by the investigating officer to the forensic chemist for examination; and, (iv) its turnover by the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the prosecution miserably failed to comply with the chain of custody rule and to proffer any justifiable ground for such non-compliance.<br><br>First, there were varying claims as to who actually took custody of the seized illegal drug after the buy-bust operation.<br><br>On one hand, IO1 Ilao testified that she kept custody of the recovered drug at the conclusion of the buy-bust operation up to the time she handed it over to the evidence custodian, IO1 Sanchez, at their office, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"

Likewise, there were conflicting accounts as to when and where the PDEA marked the items allegedly seized from appellant's house, including the specimen subject of the buy-bust. Prosecution witness IO3 Asayco testified that the marking was done at appellant's house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Yet another prosecution witness, IO1 Ilao, testified later that the marking thereof was done at their office in Tuguegarao City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Evidently, these two prosecution witnesses could not seem to get their act together.<br><br>It bears stressing that marking must be done immediately upon the seizure of the drug and in the presence of the apprehended violator of the law. The prompt marking is necessary in order that the subsequent handlers of the seized drug may use it as reference point, as the same sets apart the item from other materials from the moment it is confiscated until its disposal after the court proceedings. Simply put, marking is essential to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the recovered dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, while the absence of appellant during the marking and inventory of the seized item could be justified considering that he had evaded arrest, the presence of his representative could have been obtained because there is evidence that appellant's mother and other relatives were at the place of incident during and after the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> However, the PDEA agents did not explain at all why they failed to require such presence from any representative of appellant.<br><br><i>Third</i>, there was no explanation whatsoever why the PDEA failed to secure the presence of representatives from the DOJ and from the media during the inventory of the item subject of the buy-bust. Interestingly, the prosecution mentioned only the absence of an elective official (<i>i.e., barangay</i> officials) during the inventory, which it tried to justify by claiming that the presence of an elective official could result in the divulging or leakage of information that would have compromised the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Compounding the aforementioned failing is the lack of a photograph of the seized item with no explanation at all for such failing.<br><br>True, strict compliance with the requirements under Section 21, Article II, RA 9165, may not, at all times, be possible; still, the prosecution must justify its non-compliance with such requirement. Here the prosecution utterly failed to prove any justification for such non-compliance.<br><br>In the context of these circumstances, it becomes the constitutional duty of this Court to acquit the accused-appellant.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
