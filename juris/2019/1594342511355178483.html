				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Protestant Ferdinand "Bongbong" R. Marcos, Jr. (protestant) is before the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal) challenging the election and proclamation of incumbent Vice President Maria Leonor "Leni Daang Matuwid" G. Robredo (protestee) in the May 9, 2016 National and Local Elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <br><br>The vice presidential elections in the 2016 National and Local Elections turned out to be a close contest between protestant and protestee. Protestee garnered 14,418,817 votes while protestant came at a close second with 14,155,344 votes. Protestee won by a slim margin of only of 263,473 votes. After the canvassing of results, Congress, sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC), proclaimed protestee as the duly-elected Vice President of the Republic of the Philippines on May 30, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <br><br>P.E.T. Case No. 005 is the first and only election protest before the Tribunal in which the recount and revision process of the pilot provinces were successfully concluded and the protest itself resolved on the merits. <br><br>In <i> Defensor-Santiago v. Ramos,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; the late Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago (Santiago) contested the election of former President Fidel V. Ramos in the 1992 National and Local Elections. The protest was declared moot when Santiago ran for, and was elected, Senator in the 1995 Midterm Elections. <br><br>Contesting the results of the 2004 National and Local Elections, the late Ronald Allan Poe a.k.a. Fernando Poe, Jr. (Poe) filed an election protest against former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The case was dismissed after Poe's demise on December 14, 2004. His widow, Jesusa Sonora Poe (Mrs. Poe) filed a motion to intervene and/or substitute the deceased party, but this was denied by the Tribunal, Mrs. Poe not being considered a real party-in-interest in the election protest<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <br><br>Also in 2004, former Senator Loren B. Legarda (Legarda) initiated the first protest for the position of Vice President before the Tribunal against former Vice President Noli L. De Castro. The Tribunal dismissed the cause of action for revision of ballots when Legarda failed to pay the required additional deposit for the continuation of the revision of the ballots. As well, the Tribunal declared that Legarda had abandoned her protest by reason of her candidacy, election, and assumption as Senator after the 2007 National Local Elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>Upon the conclusion of the first nationwide elections using the Automated Election System (AES) in 2010, former Senator Manuel A. Roxas (Roxas) contested the election of former Vice President Jejomar C. Binay (Binay). However, both parties filed certificates of candidacy in the 2016 National and Local Elections for the position of President. The case was eventually overtaken by the 2016 National and Local Elections in which protestee Robredo was elected. Thus, Roxas' protest was eventually dismissed for being moot with the expiration of the term of the contested position on June 30, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <br><br>Judicial notice may be taken that the protest in this case has been the subject of much attention and speculation in the public arena. Even the Tribunal has not been immune from public vitriol and malicious imputations. The controversy over the results of the 2016 vice presidential elections has caused more social discord than the results of the presidential elections. Over and over again, questions about the accuracy and reliability of the AES during the 2016 National and Local Elections were propounded. Protestant and protestee have exchanged countless pleadings, motions, manifestations, and letters before the Tribunal Each party has made allegations of the commission of electoral frauds irregularities, and anomalies against the other. As well, the parties and their counsels have publicly traded barbs and accusations in the media regarding the protest, despite the Tribunal's warning on violation of the <i> sub judice </i> rule. <br><br>With this Resolution and the Memoranda required of both parties, the Tribunal will chart a way forward after the initial revision and recount, affording the parties the fullest opportunity to make their case consistent with due process of law. This Resolution does not yet resolve the entire case but is merely preliminary and interlocutory in nature. It is designed to hear the parties fully on the various legal issues relating to their controversy. It is not a finding for or against the protestant or the protestee. <br><br><center><br><b> I.</b></center><br><br><b><i> Filing of the Protest</i></b><br><br>Protestant filed the <i> Election Protest </i> (Protest) on June 29, 2016 grounded on two (2) causes of action, namely: <br><br><blockquote><br><center><br>A.<br>(First Cause of Action) </center><br>The proclamation of protestee Robredo as the duly elected [VICE PRESIDENT] is null and void because the [Certificates of Canvass (COCs)] generated by the [Consolidation and&nbsp; Canvass System (CCS) are not authentic, and may not be used as basis to determine the number of votes that the candidates for [Vice President] received x x x[.] <br>xxxx <br><br><center><br>B. <br>(Second Cause of Action ) </center><br>Massive electoral fraud, anomalies, and irregularities, such as, but not limited to terrorism, violence, force, threats, x x x intimidation, pre-shading of ballots, vote-buying, substitution of voters, flying voters, pre-loaded SD cards, misreading of ballots, unexplained, irregular and improper rejection of ballots containing votes for protestant Marcos, malfunctioning [Vote Counting Machines (VCMs)], and abnormally high unaccounted votes/undervotes for the position of [Vice President] compromised and corrupted the conduct of the elections and the election results for the position of [Vice President] in the protested precincts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br></blockquote>For his Second Cause of Action, the subject of which covers a total of 39,221 clustered precincts, protestant seeks both the annulment of election results and the revision and recount of ballots.

He also prayed that the proclamation of protestee as the duly-elected Vice President of the Philippines be nullified and set aside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>On his Second Cause of Action, protestant prayed that the Tribunal annul the election results for the position of Vice President in the provinces of Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, and Basilan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As to the 36,465 protested clustered precincts for Cebu Province, Leyte, Negros Occidental, Negros Oriental, Masbate, Zamboanga Del Sur, Zamboanga Del Norte, Bukidnon, Iloilo Province, Bohol, Quezon Province, Batangas, Western Samar, Misamis Oriental, Camarines Sur, 2nd District of Northern Samar, Palawan, Albay, Zamboanga Sibugay, Misamis Occidental, Pangasinan, Isabela, Iloilo City, Bacolod City, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu City, and Zamboanga City, protestant prayed for the collection, retrieval, transport, and delivery of the ballots and other election documents, and conduct of manual recount and revision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <br><br>Protestant also moved for the conduct of a technical examination and forensic investigation of the paper ballots and/or the ballot images, voter's receipts, election returns, audit logs, transmission logs, the lists of voters, particularly the Election Day Computerized Voter's List (EDCVL), and Voters Registration Records (VRR), the books of voters and other pertinent election documents and/or paraphernalia used in the 2016 National and Local Elections, as well as the automated election equipment and records such as the VCMs, CCS units, main and back-up SD cards, and the other data storage devices containing electronic data and ballot images in the 39,221 protested clustered precincts pursuant to Rules 46 to 51<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the 2010 PET Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <br><br>Lastly, protestant prayed that, after due proceedings, he be declared as the duly-elected and rightful Vice President for having obtained the highest number of valid votes cast for the said office during the 2016 National and Local Elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Protestant paid an initial cash deposit of P200,000.00<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in compliance with Rule 33(c)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the 2010 PET Rules. <br><br>In a Resolution dated July 12, 2016, the Tribunal issued a Precautionary Protection Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> over the 92,509 clustered precincts covered by the Protest. The COMELEC, its agents, representatives, and persons acting in its place, including city/municipal treasurers, election officers, and responsible personnel and custodians, were directed to preserve and safeguard the integrity of all the ballot boxes and their contents, as well as other election documents and paraphernalia in all 92,509 clustered precincts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Finding the Protest to be sufficient in form and in substance, the Tribunal issued Summons<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> to protestee, directing her to file an Answer to the Protest. <br><br><b><i> Protestee's Answer with Counter-<br>Protest</i></b><br><br>On August 15, 2016, protestee filed a <i> Verified Answer with Special and Affirmative Defenses and Counter-Protest </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Answer with Counter-Protest), moving for the dismissal of the Protest on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction and insufficiency in form and in substance. <br><br>Protestee alleged that the Protest failed to specify the acts or omissions complained of showing the electoral frauds, anomalies, or irregularities in the protested precincts, in accordance with Rule 17<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the 2010 PET Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Protestee also averred that the Protest had no legal and factual basis.

The evidence allegedly consisted mainly of hodgepodge accounts in affidavit form which were hardly credible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> On protestant's prayer for recount and revision of ballots, protestee likewise asserted that the same had no legal and factual basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <br><br>For her Counter-Protest, protestee contested the election results in 7,547 clustered precincts in thirteen (13) provinces, namely: Apayao, Mountain Province, Abra, Kalinga, Bataan, Capiz, Aklan, Antique, Sarangani, Sulu, Sultan Kudarat, South Cotabato, and North Cotabato. She alleged that vote-buying, threats, intimidation, substitute voting, and incidence of unaccounted votes occurred in these provinces, which were bailiwicks of protestant. Allegedly, had these electoral frauds and anomalies not been employed by protestant, protestee would have received a higher number of votes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <br><br>Thus, protestee prayed that a preliminary hearing be set for her special and affirmative defenses and thereafter, that the Protest be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for being insufficient in form and substance.

Protestant averred that protestee admitted that she received the Protest on August 2, 2016. Thus, under Rule 24 of the 2010 PET Rules, she had only ten (10) days or until August 12, 2016 to file the pleading. However, the Answer with Counter-Protest was filed only on August 15, 2016, hence three (3) days late.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <br><br>Furthermore, in his Answer to the Counter-Protest, protestant denied protestee 's allegations of electoral fraud, anomalies, and irregularities in the provinces covered by the Counter-Protest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Protestant also controverted protestee's allegation that the Protest was insufficient in form and in substance.

Thus, he had only ten (10) days therefrom to file his Answer to the Counter-Protest. However, protestant filed his Answer to the Counter-Protest only on September 9, 2016. <br><br>Thereafter, protestee filed another pleading, entitled <i> Manifestation with Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Expunge from the Records the Answer Ad Cautelam to the Counter-Protest</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; on September 19, 2016, reiterating that the Answer to the Counter-Protest was not filed on time. Even if the reglementary period was reckoned from protestant's receipt via registered mail of protestee's Answer with Counter-Protest with annexes, the same was still not filed on time. Protestee alleged that protestant was untruthful in stating that he received the Answer with Counter-Protest on August 30,&nbsp; 2016. Based on the Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> from Ms. Marissa Sable (Ms. Sable ), Acting Records Officer of the Philippine Postal Corporation (PhilPost), the actual receipt of the pleading was on August 28, 2016.

The Tribunal also held that the Protest was sufficient in form and in substance.

Rule 65 grants the protestant the opportunity to designate three (3) provinces that best exemplify the frauds or irregularities raised in his or her Protest.

The full effect of Rule 65, however, is yet to be determined by the Tribunal based on the required submission of Memoranda mentioned in this Resolution. <br><br>Following Rule 65, the Tribunal found it premature to retrieve the ballot boxes, decrypt and print the ballot images, and conduct a technical examination on voters' signatures from provinces other than those designated to be the pilot provinces. The Tribunal further stressed that given the physical and logistical constraints it was facing, judicial economy required that action on matters other than those pertaining to the pilot provinces be deferred until such time that an initial determination has been made in the Protest. <br><br>On September 15, 2017, protestant filed a <i>Partial Motion for Reconsideration [of the Resolution dated August 29, 2017]</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup>&nbsp; (Partial Motion for Reconsideration) praying that the Tribunal immediately direct the conduct of technical examination of the voters' signatures appearing in the EDCVL as against the voters' signatures appearing on the VRRs in each of the 2,756 protested clustered precincts in Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, and Basil an during the 2016 National and Local Elections. Protestant maintained that the technical examination was limited to the provinces in his Third Cause of Action, which was separate and independent from the pilot provinces for revision envisioned by Rule 65. <br><br>In her <i>Comment and Opposition (to the Partial Motion for Reconsideration dated 15 September 2017),</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> protestee asserted that the technical examination on the three (3) provinces covered by the Third Cause of Action is premature.

Thus, given that the allegations in the Second and Third Causes of Action are specific only to the 39,221 clustered precincts, only the said precincts remain subject of the Protest as a result of the dismissal of the First Cause of Action. In this regard, the Tribunal, in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> dated October 10, 2017, lifted the Precautionary Protection Order with respect to the 45,751 clustered precincts not covered by the Second and Third Causes of Action of the Protest and the Counter-Protest as there was no more purpose in further preserving the ballot boxes and other election paraphernalia corresponding to the 45,751 clustered precincts. <br><br><b><i> Decryption and Printing of Ballot<br>Images, Audit Logs, and Election<br>Returns</i></b><br><br>In relation to the decryption and printing of ballot images, the Tribunal, in the Resolution dated August 29, 2017, directed the COMELEC to inform the Tribunal of its recommended procedures, logistics, schedule, and cost of the decryption and printing of the ballot images for the pilot provinces of Camarines Sur, Iloilo, and Negros Oriental.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> <br><br>In compliance thereto, the COMELEC, on September 15, 2017, submitted its <i> Manifestation/Compliance with Motion,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> attaching thereto Resolution No. 10155 on the Guidelines to Decrypt Ballot Images and other/related resolutions, the Order of Payment, and Summary of Supplies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> <br><br>On October 9, 2017, the COMELEC filed another <i>Manifestation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> requesting that the decryption and printing of the ballot images, election returns, and audit logs for all the protested clustered precincts of the pilot provinces be conducted on October 23, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. at the Project Management Office of the COMELEC until the completion thereof. <br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> dated October 10, 2017, the Tribunal found the COMELEC's Compliance lacking in details, particularly on the logistics and duration of the decryption and printing activity.

Protestee claimed that the threshold percentage in determining the validity of votes during the 2016 National and Local Elections was 25% and not 50% and, thus, moved that the Tribunal direct its HRs to use the 25% threshold percentage in determining valid votes. In support of her claim, protestee cited the Random Manual Audit (RMA) Visual Guidelines and RMA Report of the COMELEC. <br><br>On April 10, 2018, the Tribunal denied Protestee's <i>Ex-Parte </i> Motion, ruling that it did not have any basis to impose the 25% threshold as even the RMA Report— the document presented by protestee to support her claim — indicates&nbsp; the impossibility of using such threshold. Moreover, the Tribunal held that the mention of a threshold in the Revisor's Guide is in reference to the 50% threshold in the 2010 PET Rules. Hence, the Tribunal retained the 50% threshold under the 2010 PET Rules as the basis of the HRs in determining a valid vote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> <br><br>Protestee filed an <i>Urgent Motion for Reconsideration (of the Resolution dated 10 April 2018) with Reiterative Prayer to Immediately Direct the Head Revisors to Use the Twenty-Five (25%) Threshold Percentage in the Revision, Recount andRe-Appreciation of Ballots </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> dated April 18, 2018 (Motion for Reconsideration). Protestee, for the first time, furnished the Tribunal a copy of COMELEC <i>en banc </i>Resolution No. 16-0600 dated September 6, 2016 wherein the COMELEC allegedly adopted the RMA guidelines as its position on the type of marks or shading that would be read by the VCMs as votes or non-votes for the 2016 National and Local Elections. <br><br>On May 28, 2018, protestant filed a <i> Comment/Opposition</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup>&nbsp; dated May 22, 2018. He argued, among others, that COMELEC Resolution No. 16-0600 did not contain a categorical declaration that the 25% threshold must be applied, even the Senate Electoral Tribunal was then observing the 50% threshold in the segregation of ballots. Protestant likewise argued that protestee failed to timely move for the amendment of the 2010 PET Rules upon the filing of the protest and is, thus, barred by <i> laches.</i><br><br>On July 6, 2018, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), acting as the People's Tribune, filed a <i> Manifestation and Motion (in Lieu of Comment),</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> stating that the Tribunal correctly upheld the 50% threshold as it had no basis to adopt the 25% threshold. It also posited that the Tribunal, being the sole judge of all contests relating to election, returns, and qualifications of the Vice President, may promulgate rules and regulations on matters falling within its jurisdiction, including the threshold to be used in its recount. It thus prayed that the Tribunal affirm its Resolution dated April 10, 2018 and grant the COMELEC a fresh period to file its own comment. <br><br>On July 23, 2018, the COMELEC filed its <i>Comment</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> narrating that it calibrated the VCMs for the 2016 National and Local Elections to read marks that cover at least about 25% (when seen by human eyes) of the oval for each candidate as valid votes. All election results were based on this threshold. It alleged that the RMA process, which involved a visual examination of the paper ballots much like a revision of ballots in election protests, used a diagrammatic guide that was consistent with the 25% threshold. According to the COMELEC, the RMA Guide - the guide submitted in evidence by protestee in her <i>Ex Parte </i>Motion - was adopted and confirmed by the COMELEC <i> en banc </i> through its Resolution No. 16-0600 and that the 25% threshold under the RMA Guide was being used in all&nbsp; its protest cases for the 2016 National and Local Elections. <br><br>Moreover, the COMELEC stated that while it recognizes the power of the Tribunal to promulgate its own rules for election contests falling within its exclusive constitutional jurisdiction, the COMELEC is endowed with a similar constitutional power to decide all questions affecting elections. It alleged that decisions on election disputes like protests must be based on standards actually used during the conduct of the elections concerned. Hence, the COMELEC submitted that the threshold issue is a question of fact, specifically, a question of what was used to appreciate, count votes, and proclaim winners in the 2016 National and Local Elections. <br><br>Acting on protestee's Motion for Reconsideration, the Tribunal, in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> dated September 18, 2018, directed its HRs to refer to the election returns used during the 2016 National and Local Elections to verify the total number of votes as read and counted by the VCMs and accordingly amended, effective immediately, Rule 62 of the Revisor's Guide to read as follows:<br><blockquote>RULE 62. <i> Votes of the Parties. </i> - <b><u>The segregation and classification of ballots shall be done by referring to the Election Return (ER) generated by the machine used in the elections</u></b>. The Head Revisor shall count the total number of ballots for the Protestant, Protestee, Other Candidates, and with Stray Votes and record said matter on the appropriate spaces of the Revision Report. <br><br>In examining the shades or marks used to register the votes, the Head Revisor shall bear in mind that the will of the voters reflected as votes in the ballots shall, as much as possible, be given effect, setting aside any technicalities. Furthermore, the votes thereon are presumed to have been made by the voter and shall be considered as such National and Local Election reasons exist that will justify their rejection. <b><u>Any issue on the segregation and classification of ballots by the Head Revisor shall be resolved by the assigned Revision Supervisor, based on the guidelines set by the Tribunal</u></b> . Any objection to the ruling of the Revision Supervisor shall not suspend the revision of a particular ballot box. The ballot in question may be claimed or objected to, as the case may be, by the revisor of the party concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> <br></blockquote>The Tribunal clarified that, prior to the Motion for Reconsideration of protestee, <i> it </i> was never furnished a copy of COMELEC Resolution No. 16-0600 which appeared to be the only official act of the COMELEC that referred to a 25% threshold. Prior to COMELEC's Comment to protestee's Motion for Reconsideration, it was never informed by the COMELEC that the latter had adopted a 25% threshold in determining valid votes. Before the filing of these pleadings, the Tribunal was merely furnished a copy of the RMA Guide which was not an official act or issuance by the COMELEC <i> en banc </i>and could not have constituted a sufficient basis to amend the rules of the Tribunal. The Tribunal likewise emphasized that the parties were apprised of the 50% threshold under the 2010 PET Rules before the start of the revision proceedings, but neither of them brought COMELEC Resolution No. 16-0600 to the Tribunal's attention. <br><br>In any case, the Tribunal declared that from the submissions of the parties and the COMELEC, what was adopted during the 2016 National and Local Elections was a range of 20% to 25% shading threshold for the following reasons: first, no official document predating the 2016 National and Local Elections was submitted to support the claim that the machines were indeed calibrated to observe a 25% threshold; second, in COMELEC Commissioner Luie Tito G. Guia's letter to the Tribunal dated September 6, 2016, it was disclosed that the public was not apprised of a 25% voting threshold as the voters were told to shade the ovals fully; third, no threshold was adopted for the 2016 National and Local Elections prior to COMELEC Resolution No. 16-0600, except for the 20% threshold for detainee voting under COMELEC Resolution No. 10115 dated May 3, 2016; and finally, the RMA Visual Guidelines states that a valid mark must score higher than a VCM's mark detection threshold of 20%-25%; otherwise, it is considered an invalid mark. <br><br>As to what must be used in its revision of ballots, the Tribunal noted that the purpose of the revision process is simply to recount the votes of the parties. This is implemented by mimicking (or verifying/confirming) how the VCMs read and counted the votes during the elections. This objective can be achieved by referring to the election returns generated by the VCMs used in the 2016 National and Local Elections; The election return is a document in electronic and printed form directly produced by the VCM showing the date, province, municipality, and precinct in which the election was held, and the votes in figures for each candidate in a clustered precinct where the said VCM was utilized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> <br><br>Hence, in the segregation of ballots, the Tribunal held that its Head Revisors must be guided by the number of votes indicated in the Election Returns. The Tribunal held that, in using the Election Returns and not merely adopting a specific shading threshold, the Tribunal's revision procedure will be more flexible and adaptive to calibrations of the voting or counting machines in the future. The Head Revisors were directed to use the Election Returns which normally would be inside the ballot boxes retrieved. However, in their absence, the Head Revisors were directed to use the certified true copies of Election Returns obtained from COMELEC. As to those ballots already previously revised, the procedure of verifYing votes using the Election Returns was to be strictly enforced during the appreciation stage by the Tribunal. <br><br>Hence, from October 1, 2018 up to the conclusion of the revision process on February 4, 2019, the Head Revisors referred to the Election Returns and segregated the votes of the parties in accordance with the votes reflected therein. <br><br><b><i> Protestant's Motion for Inhibition</i></b><br><br>On August 6, 2018, protestant filed an <i>Extremely Urgent Motion to Inhibit Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup> (Motion to Inhibit ) on the ground of evident bias and manifest partiality in favor of protestee. <br><br>Protestant alleged that the Member-in-Charge, Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa (Justice Caguioa), was biased in favor of protestee due to his close ties with former President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III (former President Aquino) who was a member of the same political party as protestee. Former President Aquino was a classmate of Justice Caguioa and had previously appointed him as Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, Secretary of Justice, and eventually, as Associate Justice of the SC. Protestant asserted that former President Aquino and his family bore a grudge against protestant and had handpicked protestee as the Liberal Party's candidate for Vice President in the 2016 National and Local Elections. Protestant also insinuated that Justice Caguioa's spouse was close to former President Aquino's family and protestee, and campaigned tor the latter during the 2016 National and Local Elections. Based on these claims,protestant prayed to recuse Justice Caguioa from participating in any of the proceedings in connection with the Protest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup><br><br>In support of his Motion to Inhibit, protestant appended an August 4, 2018 column entitled "Questions that need answers" by Len Montafio published on the website <u>www.radyo.inquirer.net</u> the alleged conjugal conspiracy video which was supposedly circulating in social media, along with a copy of the said video. <br><br>The Tribunal unanimously denied protestant's Motion to Inhibit in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup> dated August 28, 2018 for utter lack of merit, ruling that the grounds cited by protestant did not fall under any of the grounds for inhibition under Section 1,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> Rule 8 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court. Citing <i>Philippine Commercial International Bank v. Spouses Dy,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> the Tribunal held that the mere imputation of bias or partiality was not sufficient ground for inhibition, especially when the charges against Justice Caguioa were without basis and not supported by any evidence. <br><br>The Tribunal further held that an opinion piece in a news website and an unauthenticated video circulating on social media websites were not credible and admissible supporting evidence, and that these were not even worthy of cognizance. <br><br>The Tribunal also found that Justice Caguioa had shown impartiality and that the proceedings in the Protest had moved forward with utmost dispatch despite the numerous pleadings filed and incidents brought up by both parties and the COMELEC, as well as the logistical and administrative concerns in relation to the Protest. The Tribunal also emphasized that all of its decisions were arrived at through a majority vote of all the members of the Court sitting en banc as the Tribunal, and not decided by the Member-in-Charge alone. Thus, the Tribunal denied protestant's Motion to Inhibit for lack of factual and legal basis. <br><br><b><i> Appreciation of Ballots</i></b><br><br>After the revision had concluded, the revised ballots were then appreciated. During this process, the Tribunal validates and verifies the physical count of the ballots during the revision stage and rules on the parties' respective claims and objections thereon. <br><br>For this purpose, the Tribunal approved, on November 6, 2018, the PET Guidelines in the Appreciation of Ballots Under the Automated Election System<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> (Ballot Appreciation Guidelines), which superseded and replaced the Guidelines previously approved by the Tribunal on January 16, 2018.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> The Ballot Appreciation Guidelines were used in the appreciation of the ballots, specifically in determining the validity of the ballots and whether they contained valid votes. The cardinal objective of ballot appreciation was to discover and give effect to the intent of the voter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> <br><br><b><i> The appreciation of the revised ballots from the pilot provinces started on January 14,2019 and was completed on August 14, 2019.</i></b><br><br><b><i> Protestant's Omnibus Motion and</i><br><i> Protestee's Motion to Resolve</i></b><br><br>As discussed, the Tribunal resolved to defer action on protestant's Motion for Technical Examination until after its initial determination of the grounds of the Protest under Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules. This was reiterated by the Tribunal in its November 7, 2017 Resolution of protestant's Motion for Reconsideration. <br><br>Despite the foregoing, protestant filed an <i>Extremely Urgent </i><i>Manifestation of Grave Concern with Omnibus Motion</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> dated December 10, 2018 (Omnibus Motion) where he narrated that an election protest was filed by Abdusakur M. Tan (Tan) against Mujiv Hataman (Hataman) before the COMELEC, docketed as EPC Case No. 2016-37. Protestant averred that Tan informed him that the Voter's Identification Division (VID) of the COMELEC-ERSD conducted a technical examination of the signatures and thumbprints appearing in the VRRs and compared them to those in the EDCVL of 508 established precincts in the provinces of Lanao de Sur, Maguindanao, and Basilan - the same three (3) provinces subject of his Third Cause of Action and Motion for Technical Examination. Allegedly, the technical examination revealed that 40,528 signatures and 3,295 thumbprints in the EDCVL of these precincts did not match the original signatures and thumbprints in their VRRs. Consequently, the VID concluded that the "2016 National, Local and ARMM elections [were] marked with different forms of election fraud such as massive substituted voting."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> Hence, protestant prayed that the Tribunal issue a <i> subpoena duces tecum </i> to the VID to produce and submit the report on the alleged technical examination that it conducted on the 508 established precincts, investigate the BEIs concerned, and immediately direct the VID to conduct a technical examination on EDCVLs and VRRs of the entire 2,756 protested clustered precincts of the three (3) subject provinces. <br><br>The Tribunal directed both protestee and the COMELEC to file their respective Comments. Protestee filed a <i>Counter-Manifestation with Comment and Opposition (On the Extremely Urgent Manifestation of Grave Concern with Omnibus Motion dated 10 December </i><i> 2018</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> dated January 14, 2019, arguing that granting the prayer for technical examination would be tantamount to allowing the protestant to expand his designated pilot provinces in contravention of Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules. For its part, the COMELEC filed a <i>Manifestation (In lieu of a Comment on Protestant Marcos</i>' <i>Extremely Urgent Manifestation of Grave Concern with Omnibus Motion)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> dated February 5, 2019 confirming that EPC Case No. 2016-37 was then pending before the COMELEC Second Division, and thus, was covered by the <i>sub judice </i>rule which restricts disclosures pertaining to ongoing judicial proceedings. <br><br>Protestant filed a <i>Consolidated Reply with Urgent Motion to Resolve Protestant's Omnibus Motion</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup>&nbsp; dated March 22, 2019, where he countered that protestee's argument was misleading, as his Second and Third Causes of Action are separate and independent from one another. Allegedly, his Second Cause of Action was for judicial revision and recount of ballots while his Third Cause of Action was for the annulment of election results in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao and Basilan. Thus, these provinces were excluded from the coverage of the pilot protested provinces mandated by Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules. <br><br>On the other hand, protestee filed an <i>Urgent Motion to Immediately Resolve all Pending Incidents</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> dated June 11, 2019 (Urgent Motion ). Protestee prayed that the Tribunal immediately resolve all pending incidents after the revision and recount of the ballots. She presented her own computation of the total national votes for protestant and protestee after "revision, recount, and re-appreciation," claiming that her victory as Vice President had been confirmed. In effect, protestee sought the immediate resolution of the Protest. <br><br><i> <b>In the Resolution</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> <i><b> dated July 2, 2019, the Tribunal again resolved to defer action on protestant's Omnibus Motion until after its initial determination of the grounds for the Protest under Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules</b>.</i> The Tribunal reiterated its prior ruling in its Resolution dated August 29, 2017 that the technical examination of the voter's records in the three (3) subject provinces was premature, as these provinces were not part of the pilot provinces of protestant and that Rule 65 allows the Tribunal to conduct revision of ballots and reception of evidence on these pilot protested precincts. <br><br>The Tribunal also found protestee's Urgent Motion premature considering that the Tribunal has yet to complete the appreciation of the revised ballots and ruling on the respective objections and claims made by the parties thereon. <br><br><div align="center"><b>II. </b><br></div><b><br><i> Results of the Revision and <br>Appreciation of Ballots in the Pilot <br>Provinces</i></b><br><br><i> <u>Revision</u></i><br><br>Based on the canvass by the National Board of Canvassers<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> during the May 9, 2016 National and Local Elections, and as admitted by both parties,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> protestant and protestee received the following votes: <br><blockquote><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="462" valign="top"> Protestee Robredo </td> <td width="639" valign="top"> <div align="RIGHT">14,418,817 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="462" valign="top"> Protestant Marcos, Jr. </td> <td width="639" valign="top"> <div align="RIGHT">14,155,344 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="462" valign="top"> Margin of votes </td> <td width="639" valign="top"> <div align="RIGHT">(263,473) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><i>Table 1</i><br></blockquote>The table below shows the votes (as declared in provincial COCs ) obtained by the ·parties in each of the pilot provinces <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> handpicked by protestant: <br><blockquote><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="424" valign="top"><br></td> <td width="337" valign="top"> <div align="RIGHT">Robredo </div></td> <td width="338" valign="top"> <div align="RIGHT">Marcos, Jr. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Camarines Sur </td> <td valign="top"><div align="RIGHT">664,190 </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="RIGHT">41,219</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Iloilo </td> <td valign="top"><div align="RIGHT">573,729 </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="RIGHT">94,411 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Negros Oriental </td> <td valign="top"><div align="RIGHT">255,598 </div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="RIGHT">66,506 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="424" valign="top"><b>Total votes</b></td> <td width="337" valign="top"><div align="RIGHT"><b>1,493,517</b> </div></td> <td width="338" valign="top"><div align="RIGHT"><b>202,136</b> </div></td> </tr></tbody></table></blockquote><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 2</i><br><br>The total clustered precincts from the three (3) pilot provinces are as follows: <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"> Camarines Sur </td> <td width="558" valign="top"><div align="right"> 1,816 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="559" valign="top"> Iloilo </td> <td width="558" valign="top"><div align="right"> 2,318 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="559" valign="top"> Negros Oriental </td> <td width="558" valign="top"><div align="right"> 1,284 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="559" valign="top"><b> Total</b></td> <td width="558" valign="top"><div align="right"><b> 5,418</b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Table 3</i><br><br>In the course of the revision, the Tribunal observed that the paper ballots in several clustered precincts were wet and unreadable, or their integrity was compromised such that it rendered revision using paper ballots impossible.

Spurious Ballots (SB) <br><br>Spurious ballots are those ballots which were not issued by the COMELEC as they do not contain the security features, or where the signature of the BEl chairperson is glaringly different compared to the BEl chairperson's signature appearing in the other ballots and other election paraphernalia (SB-BEI). <br><br>A ballot is spurious if it lacks any of the security features of the official ballots, which are the timing marks, ultraviolet ink mark, box for signature of the BEI chairperson, ballot lD, precinct in cluster, and the barcode (SB-FAKE). <br><br>A BEI chairperson's failure to sign or initial a ballot will, however, not invalidate a ballot, as this would otherwise disenfranchise the voters and place a premium on official ineptness. <br><br>B. Substituted Ballots (SuB) <br><br>Substituted ballots are ballots where the ballot lD on the paper ballot does not match the precinct-assigned ballot ID. <br><br>C.

Absent such evidence, the Tribunal shall admit the ballots. <br><br>Evidence <i> aliunde </i> is required as it would not be possible to determine whether two (2) or more ballots were filled in by one (1) person just by looking at the ballot. Further, since the ballots are filled in by just shading the corresponding oval, it would be impossible to know just by looking at the ballots if one (1) person shaded two (2) or more ballots. <br><br>D.

It must be shown that the over-voting was done deliberately to mark the ballot. <br><br>A ballot may also be considered as marked due to pattern voting (MB­ PV). This means that the ballots were marked by several voters in an identical manner for the purpose of identifYing themselves or their ballots.

Machine-Rejected Ballots (MRB ) <br><br>Machine-Rejected Ballots are ballots which were not read by the machines when fed during the election. <br><br>a. Admittd Machine-rejected Ballot (AMRB)<br>&nbsp;<br>A claim on a vote on a machine-rejected ballot may be admitted in favor of a party if, upon its physical examination, it is found to contain a valid vote for the claimant; provided that the ballot is authentic (contains all the security features of an official ballot), belongs to the contested clustered precinct concerned, and is not otherwise a marked ballot (MB). <br><br>b. Rejected Machine-rejected Ballot (RMRB) <br><br>A claim on a vote on a machine-rejected ballot may be rejected if the ballot does not contain a vote for the claimant even if the ballot does not suffer from any infirmity, or the ballot contains a vote for the claimant but the ballot suffers from an infirmity. <br><br>D. No Specific Claim (NSC) <br><br>The parties must specify the grounds for their claims on ambiguous votes, ballots with over-votes and machine-rejected ballots. Otherwise, their claims shall be denied. <br><br>Similar to objections, the Tribunal has the plenary power to <i> motu proprio </i> add a vote to a party even if a party did not register a claim to it if, upon its examination of the ballot, there exist grounds for the addition of such vote to the party. <br><br>From the foregoing, the total votes added to the parties, which correspond to their respective total admitted claims, are as follows: <br><br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="61%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="17%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"><b>Robredo</b></div></td> <td width="22%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"><b>Marcos,<br>&nbsp; Jr. </b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Camarines Sur </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">12,004</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">734</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Iloilo</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">16,825</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">2,127</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Negros Oriental </div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">5,819</div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT">1,254</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"><b>Total votes added</b></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><b>34,648 </b></div></td> <td><div align="RIGHT"><b>4,115</b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><i>Table 7</i><br></blockquote><br>The rulings on protestant's objections are marked as <b> Annex "B", </b> on protestee's objections as <b> Annex "B-1", </b> on protestants claims as <b> "Annex </b> C", on protestee's claims as <b> Annex "C-1'·, </b> on uncontested ballots as <b> Annex </b><b>"D" </b> and on unclaimed ballots as <b> "Annex D-1". </b> These annexes will be maintained at the Tribunal's Revision Hall at the 5<sup>th</sup> Floor of the SC-CA Gymnasium and are available for the parties to view. <br>&nbsp;<br><b><i> Overall Result of Revision and</i></b><br><b><i> Appreciation of Ballots</i></b><br><br>To determine the effect of the revision and appreciation of the ballots in the 5,415 pilot clustered precincts, the Tribunal uses as its base figure the overall votes received by protestant and protestee in all the clustered precincts which functioned during the 2016 National and Local Elections based on the canvass by the National Board of Canvassers (votes as proclaimed). As shown in Table 1, protestee garnered 14,418,817 votes and protestant obtained 14,155,344 votes. <br><br>From these figures, the votes received by the parties in the 5,418 clustered precincts of the three (3) pilot provinces is then to be subtracted as these figures or votes will be replaced by the results of the revision and appreciation of the ballots to determine the effect of the revision and appreciation on the results of the 2016 National Local Elections. <br><br>However, as discussed above, the paper ballots and ballot images in three (3) of the 5,418 clustered precincts of the pilot provinces were not revised and appreciated as they were unavailable, and were thus excluded from the 5,418 clustered precincts. Given this, the Tribunal was able to revise and appreciate ballots from only 5,415 clustered precincts of the pilot provinces, and the results of what the parties garnered are in the following table: <br><br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"><b>Robredo</b></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"><b>Marcos, Jr. </b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="58%" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Votes in the 5,418 clustered precincts of the three pilot provmces based on the Provincial COCs </div></td> <td width="18%" valign="TOP"><div align="RIGHT">1,493,517 </div></td> <td width="24%" valign="TOP"><div align="RIGHT">202,136 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Less: Votes in the three (3) clustered precincts with&nbsp;

After the revision and appreciation, the lead of protestee Robredo increased from 263,473 to 278,566. <br><br>Before the Tribunal proceeds to make a ruling on the effects of the results of the revision and appreciation of the votes for the pilot provinces on the Protestant's Second Cause of Action as articulated in the Preliminary Conference Order, the Parties will be required to submit their position stating their factual and legal basis. <br><br>Likewise, the Tribunal deems it essential to meet due process requirements to require protestant and protestee to now provide their position in relation to the Third Cause of Action also articulated  in<i> </i> the Preliminary Conference Order. The Tribunal notes the pending Motion for Technical Examination<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> dated July 10, 2017 and Extremely Urgent Manifestation of Grave Concern with Omnibus Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup> dated December 10, 2018, as well as protestee's Manifestation dated October 14, 2019, and the earlier deferments made by the Tribunal of the various issues related to the Third Cause of Action. <br><br>This controversy has spawned very serious but unfounded and careless speculations on the part of many partisan observers who, on the basis of incomplete information, would rather latch on to their favorite conspiratorial theories rather than critically examine the facts and the law involved in this case. This Tribunal, however, will comply with its constitutionally mandated duty allowing the parties the opportunity to examine the results of the revision and appreciation of the pilot provinces as well as comment so that they are fully and fairly heard on all the related legal issues. Based on the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal can therefore confidently and judiciously deliberate on the proper course of action as clarified by the actual position of the parties on the common issues that we have identified. <br>&nbsp;<br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> the parties are directed to submit a <b> MEMORANDUM </b> within twenty (20) working days, starting from receipt of a copy of this Resolution containing: <br><blockquote><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">I. </div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Their comments on the report on the revision and appreciation of votes relating to the three pilot provinces, Camarines Sur, Iloilo, and Negros Oriental as it relates to the Second Cause of Action; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td width="5%" valign="TOP"><br></td> <td width="4%" valign="TOP"><br></td> <td width="86%" valign="TOP"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">II.</div></td> <td colspan="3" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Their position on the following issues related to the Third Cause of Action: <br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">A)</div></td> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not the results in the revision and appreciation of votes with respect to the Protestant's second cause of action moots or renders unnecessary the consideration of the Protestant's Third Cause of Action; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">B) </div></td> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Whether or not the Presidential Electoral Tribunal has the competence to resolve the Third Cause of Action; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">C) </div></td> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Assuming that the Presidential Electoral Tribunal has the competence to resolve the Third Cause of Action which is not mooted by the results of Tribunal's findings with respect to the second cause of action:</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">1) </div></td> <td>What are the filing rules and requirements that a party must observe if he or she seeks the relief of annulment of elections before the Presidential Electoral Tribunal? </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">2) </div></td> <td>What is the threshold of evidence that is required to prove failure or annulment of elections? </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">3)</div></td> <td> Will evidence other than those listed by the parties during the preliminary conference be considered?</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">4)</div></td> <td> What percentage of votes/precincts needs to be proven as having been affected by the grounds for failure or annulment of elections? </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">5) </div></td> <td>Will the threshold apply per province or to all three (3) provinces?

If upon examination of such ballots and proof, and after making reasonable allowances, the Tribunal is convinced that, taking all circumstances into account, the protestant or counter-protestant will most probably fail to make out his case, the protest may forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in the protest. <br><br>The preceding paragraph shall also apply when the election protest involves correction of manifest errors. (Boldfacing and italicization supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The revision of the ballots in these pilot provinces had the following objectives: verify the actual physical count of the ballots; recount the votes of the parties; record the parties' objections and claims thereon; and mark the ballots objected to and/or claimed by the parties in preparation for their examination by the Tribunal and for the reception of the parties' evidence.<br><br>After the revision, the revised ballots were then subjected to appreciation wherein the Tribunal verified the physical count and ruled on the objections and claims of the parties. <br><br>The final tally after the revision and the appreciation of the votes in the pilot provinces resulted in a <i> net increase </i> of votes by 15,093 in favor of the protestee. <br><br>Since the revision results indicate no substantial recovery on the part of protestant, and thus protestant "will most probably fail to make out his case," the dismissal of the election protest, and thus, the discontinuance of any further proceedings, such as the revision of the remaining contested provinces, is proper pursuant to Rule 65 ofthe 2010 PET Rules. <br><br><b><i> The Number of Pilot Provinces Must Be "Not More Than Three"</i></b><br><br>Rule 65 expressly states that "[t]he Tribunal <b>may</b> require the protestant or counter-protestant to indicate, within a fixed period, the province or provinces numbering not more than three, best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities alleged in his petition; and the revision of ballots and reception of evidence will begin with such provinces." <br><br>As a general rule, the use of the word "may" in a statute, or in this case Rules of Procedure, denotes that it is directory in nature. The word "may" is generally permissive only and operates to confer discretion.' <br><br>The word "may" in Rule 65 refers to the discretion of the Tribunal to dismiss or not the protest, and if the Tribunal does not dismiss the protest, to require the protestant to designate <b>"not more than three" pilot provinces, a mandatory ceiling. The word "may" recognizes that the Tribunal may summarily dismiss the protest, in which event there will be no reason to require the designation of pilot provinces. But if the Tribunal does not dismiss the protest, there will be a need to designate "not more than three" pilot provinces.</b> The word "may" has never been interpreted to pertain to the number of pilot provinces, which must be "not more than three," a language which is a clear mandatory command that the number of pilot provinces shall not exceed three. <br><br>In the case of pilot precincts designated in election contests before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) and Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET), it has been consistently understood that the pilot precincts shall be not more than or at most 25% of the total number of precincts involved in the protest in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of these electoral tribunals.

Since the pilot provinces or precincts best exemplify the fraud or irregularities alleged in the protest, these must necessarily cover all causes of action grounded on fraud or irregularities and thus requiring revision and recount of ballots. <br><br>There is nothing in the Rules of the PET, or in the SET and HRET, that pilot provinces or precincts may be designated for each cause of action. This is precisely because the number of pilot provinces refers to the entire protest, not to one or two or each cause of action. There is simply no rule or law separating the revision or recount of ballots on the ground of acts of terrorism. <br><br>To repeat, upon filing of the election protest, the Tribunal may dismiss the protest summarily if it suffers from any of the defects enumerated in Section 21<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the PET Rules. Otherwise, the Tribunal shall require the protestee to file an answer to the protest. After the filing of the last pleading, the Tribunal shall order a preliminary conference. At least five days before the preliminary conference, the parties are required to file their respective preliminary conference briefs, which must contain the list of <b>"not more than three"</b> provinces which the parties may designate pursuant to Rule 65. <br><br>It is clear from the Rules that the Tribunal may or may not dismiss the protest summarily. If the protest suffers from any of the defects enumerated in Section 21 of the PET Rules, the Tribunal may dismiss the protest. But if the protest does not suffer from any such defects, the Tribunal will not dismiss the protest and the election contest will proceed with the Tribunal requiring the protestee to file an answer. This is the import of the word "may" in Rule 65. <b>The word "may" in Rule 65, after the word "Tribunal" and before the word "require," refers obviously to the Tribunal's discretion whether or not to dismiss the protest depending on whether or not the protest suffers from any of the defects enumerated in Section 21 of the PET Rules. If it suffers none of such defects</b>, the designation of <b>"not more than three"</b> pilot provinces becomes <b>mandatory</b>. The word "may" does not refer to the number of the pilot provinces which in no uncertain terms is limited to a maximum of three pilot provinces best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities protestant alleged in his protest.<b> In other words, while the dismissal of the protest is discretionary on the part of the Tribunal, as the use of the word "may" clearly signifies, the number of pilot provinces, which should be "not more than three," is mandatory if the protest is allowed to proceed. </b><br><br>Moreover, should the pilot provinces refer to each cause of action, then the maximum number of pilot provinces will definitely exceed three. This interpretation effectively defeats and contravenes the express language of the Rules setting a maximum of <b>"not more than three"</b> pilot provinces. This interpretation will lead to absurdity. If protestant has at least five causes of action, nothing will prevent him from designating at the most 15 pilot provinces. Further, the election contest process starting from the retrieval,collection, revision and appreciation of ballots, pertaining to the first batch of pilot provinces, will be repeated insofar as the additional pilot provinces are concerned. Such construction will not only result to unreasonable delay in the resolution of the election contest, but will also make a mockery of the entire election contest process. <br><br>Further, to allow protestant to designate more than three pilot provinces, as he now demands, is to change the Rules in the middle of the proceedings to accommodate him. <br><br>A change in the number of pilot provinces cannot also be justified just because the Tribunal, in the present case, has formally changed its Rules to admit ballots with less than 50% shading as valid votes. The amendment of the Rules on shading of ballots has no material effect whatsoever on the validity of the ballots in the appreciation of the ballots. The amendment was simply a formality to conform to the rule that the COMELEC adopted and actually implemented in the 2016 elections. <br><br>Rule 43(1) of the 2010 PET Rules reads: </jmment><br><jmment [to="" the="" compliance="" and="" urgent="" motion="" to="" defer="" payment="" of="" second="" installment="" additional="" cash="" deposit="" dated="" 13="" july="" 2017],="" <i=""><blockquote>In looking at the shades or marks used to register votes, the [Revision Committee] shall bear in mind that the will of the voters reflected as votes in the ballots shall as much as possible be given effect, setting aside any technicalities. Furthermore, the votes thereon are presumed to have been made by the voter and shall be considered as such unless reasons exist that will justify their rejection. However, marks or shades which are less than 50% of the oval shall not be considered as valid votes. Any issue as to whether a certain mark or shade is within the threshold shall be determined by feeding the ballot on the PCOS machine, and not by human determination. <br></blockquote>In a Resolution dated 18 September 2018, the Tribunal "directed its [Head Revisors] to refer to the Election Returns (ERs) used during the 2016 National and Local Elections to verify the total number of votes as read and counted by the VCMs and accordingly amended, effective immediately, Rule 62 of the Revisor's Guide, "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> thus: <br><blockquote><br>RULE 62. Votes of the Parties. - The segregation and classification of ballots shall be done by referring to the Election returns (ER) generated by the machine used in the elections. The Head revisor shall count the total number of ballots for the Protestant, Protestee, Other Candidates, and with Stray Votes record said matter on the appropriate spaces of the Revision Report. <br><br>In examining the shades or marks used to register the votes, the Head revisor shall bear in mind that the will of the voters reflected as votes in the ballots shall, as much as possible, be given effect, setting aside any technicalities. Furthermore, the votes thereon are presumed to have been made by the voter and shall be considered as such unless reasons exist that will justify their rejection. Any issue on the segregation and classification of ballots by the Head Revisor shall be resolved by the assigned Revision Supervisor, based on the guidelines set by the Tribunal. Any objection to the ruling of the Revision Supervisor shall not suspend the revision of a particular ballot box. The ballot in question may be claimed or objected to, as the case may be, by the revisor of the party concerned.</blockquote>The Tribunal noted that the objective of the revision process, which is simply to recount the votes of the parties by mimicking (or verifying or confirming) how the vote counting machines read and counted the votes during the elections, can be achieved by referring to the ERs generated by the vote counting machines used in the 2016 elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The Tribunal held that "in using the Election Returns and not merely adopting a specific shading threshold, the Tribunal's revision procedure will be more flexible and adaptive to calibrations of the voting or counting machines in the future. " <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <br><br>Reference to the ERs, as well as admitting ballots with less than 50% or at least 25% shading, during the revision process does not constitute a change in the Rules of Procedure of the Tribunal which infringes on the rights of any of the parties. <b>In fact, admitting ballots with at least 25% shading is pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 16-0600 dated 6 September 2016. In its Comment, the COMELEC stated that "it calibrated the VCMs for the 2016 National and Local Elections to read marks that cover at least about 25% (when seen by human eyes) of the oval for each candidate as valid votes. All election results were based on this threshold."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>Moreover, during the appreciation process, which takes place after the revision process, <b>the ballots with less than 25% shading or even only a dot or line appearing in the oval as long as the voter's manner of voting is consistent are admitted as valid votes for either party pursuant to the intent rule. This has been the universal rule and practice in the appreciation of ballots in the present case, and in all other previous cases, whether in the COMELEC, SET or HRET</b>. Hence, the amount of shading, whether 100% or 10% as long as the manner of voting is consistent, is immaterial in determining the intent of the voter. It is settled that the cardinal objective in ballot appreciation is to discover and give effect to, rather than frustrate, the intention of the voter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> To rule otherwise, that is to reject ballots with less than 25% shading pursuant to the 50% threshold as stated in the PET Rules, will necessarily result to disenfranchisement of the voters. <br><br><b>Therefore, in referring to the ERs and admitting ballots with at least 25% shading, the Tribunal did not introduce a new procedure or change any of its Rules in the middle of the proceedings that prejudiced the rights of any party. The Tribunal merely followed an existing COMELEC rule, which was actually implemented during the 2016 elections. <i> More importantly, because of the intent rule, even a dot or a single line in the oval, constituting less than 10 percent shading, will be counted in the appreciation process as a valid vote as long as the voter's manner of voting is consistent.</i></b><br><br><b><center><br><i> Examination of Ballots is Indispensable in</i><br><i> Annulment of </i><i>Election Results</i></center></b><br>In <i>Abayon v.

The Court held that there is no clear and convincing evidence to warrant the nullification of the elections. In so ruling, the Court cited the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Diosdado M. Peralta in this HRET case, which stated that "[w]hen a person elected obtained a considerable plurality of votes over his adversary, and the evidence offered to rebut such a result is neither solid nor decisive, it would be imprudent to quash the election, as that would be to oppose without reason the popular will solemnly expressed in suffrage."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br>In the same Dissenting Opinion of Justice Peralta in <i>Abayon,</i> he correctly stated that the best and most conclusive evidence in determining the legality of the ballots are the ballots themselves, thus: </jmment><jmment [to="" the="" compliance="" and="" urgent="" motion="" to="" defer="" payment="" of="" second="" installment="" additional="" cash="" deposit="" dated="" 13="" july="" 2017],="" <i=""><blockquote>x x x. How can the Tribunal accurately determine which among the contested ballots ought to be invalidated on the ground of terrorism? Certainly, this Tribunal cannot merely speculate and assume which contested ballots will be nullified due to terrorism as this&nbsp; would result to grave consequences -the disenfranchisement of the voters. <br><br>Indeed, such uncertainty cannot achieve the purpose of an election protest. It bears stressing that "the purpose of an election protest is to ascertain whether the candidate proclaimed elected by the board of canvassers is really the lawful choice of the electorate. In an election contest where the correctness of the number of votes is involved, the best and most conclusive evidence are the ballots themselves ... The best way, therefore, to test the truthfulness of petitioner's claim is to open the ballot boxes in the protested precincts followed by the examination, revision, recounting and re-appreciation of the official ballots therein contained in accordance with law and pertinent rules on the matter . . . "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </blockquote><br>&nbsp;It is well-settled that there are two (2) indispensable requisites that must concur in order to justify the nullification of the election: <br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The illegality of the ballots must affect <b>more than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast on the specific precinct or precincts sought to be annulled, or in case of the entire municipality, more than fifty percent (50%) of its total precincts and the votes cast therein</b>; and </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to distinguish with reasonable certainty between the lawful and unlawful ballots. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>In resolving protestant's claim of terrorism in three provinces, namely, Lanao del Sur, Basilan and Maguindanao, which would possibly warrant the nullification of the elections therein, these two requisites must be clearly shown. In proving terrorism as a ground to nullify the elections, protestant must therefore present the ballots themselves precisely because they are the most conclusive evidence of their legality or illegality. <b>In other words, protestant's third cause of action, which is the annulment of the election results on the ground of terrorism, <i> similarly calls for the revision and recount of the ballots. </i> This means there will be a revision and recount of the ballots to determine if there was illegality of the ballots affecting more than 50% of total votes cast. This is obvious because the Tribunal cannot determine whether the illegality of the ballots affected more than 50% of the votes cast in the specific precinct/s sought to be annulled and the Tribunal likewise cannot distinguish between the lawful and unlawful ballots, without examining the ballots themselves.</b> <br><br>Since protestant's two causes of action are both anchored on the actual revision and recount of the votes cast as appearing in the ballots, protestant should have included in his pilot provinces any of the provinces which he deems best exemplified or demonstrated the acts of terrorism he alleged in his protest. <b>The provinces subject of an annulment case should form part of the pilot provinces because all these provinces will be subjected to revision and recount of ballots</b>. Not doing so amounts to a waiver on the part of the protestant to have the ballots from the excluded contested provinces revised and recounted. <br><br>To repeat, there is nothing in the Rules that pilot provinces may be designated for each cause of action precisely because the number of pilot provinces, which must be "not more than three," refers to the entire protest. <br><br>Notably, protestant himself is very much aware of this established rule. In his <i> Consolidated Reply with Urgent Motion to Resolve Protestant's Omnibus Motion, </i> dated 22 March 2019, he claimed that <b>"his Second Cause of Action is for judicial revision and recount of ballots while his Third Cause of Action is for the annulment of election results in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao and Basilan. Thus, these <i> provinces were excluded from the coverage of the pilot protested provinces mandated by Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules."</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Protestant himself expressly admitted that the ARMM provinces are not part of the pilot provinces. In other words, protestant knowingly excluded these ARMM provinces from his chosen pilot provinces, which shall serve as "test cases" by which the Tribunal will determine whether or not to proceed with the revision of ballots of the remaining contested provinces.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Insofar as protestant is concerned, annulment of election results will not require revision of ballots, and thus he intended to merely present "testimonial and documentary evidence that would prove that voters in Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao and Basilan were deprived of their right to vote on election day."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <br><br>However, protestant's theory is wrong. To annul the election results, an examination of the contested ballots is indispensable. As stated, two requisites must concur before a nullification of election is declared: <br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The illegality of the ballots must affect <b>more than fifty percent (50%) of the votes cast on the specific precinct or precincts sought to be annulled, or in case of the entire municipality, more than fifty percent (50%) of its total precincts and the votes cast therein;</b> and </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> <td valign="TOP"><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to distinguish with reasonable certainty between the lawful and unlawful ballots. x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis supplied ) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote><br>In an election contest where what is involved is the correctness of the number of votes of each candidate, the best and most conclusive evidence are the ballots themselves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Tribunal cannot determine the legality (or the illegality) of the ballots without examining the ballots themselves. Therefore, contrary to protestant's theory, protestant's third cause of action, which seeks the annulment of election results in Basilan, Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao, undoubtedly requires the revision and recount of ballots. If any or all of these provinces best demonstrate the fraud or irregularities, specifically terrorism, alleged in his petition, protestant should have included the same in his pilot provinces. However, protestant did not do so. <br><br><b>To exclude from the pilot provinces those provinces subject to an annulment case will allow the protestant to exceed the maximum number of pilot provinces prescribed in the Rules.</b> Thus, a protestant will claim terrorism for provinces outside his three pilot provinces. If he makes a substantial recovery from the three pilot provinces, then he will simply manifest that the second phase of the protest can proceed since he has made a substantial recovery. If he fails to make a substantial recovery from the three pilot provinces, then he will demand to revise and recount the ballots from the provinces where he claims terrorism, similar to what protestant Marcos now demands. The protestant will be playing with the Rules of the Tribunal and in the process will make a mockery of the election contest process. This the&nbsp; Tribunal must definitely not allow. <br><br>Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules expressly requires protestant to name <b>"not more than three" provinces </b>that best exemplify the frauds and irregularities alleged in the protest. The Tribunal will be violating its own Rules if it allows a revision and recount of ballots in other provinces in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), <b>beyond the maximum three provinces chosen by protestant.</b><br><br>Finally, for the Tribunal to allow a revision and recount of the protestant's contested precincts in three ARMM provinces, exceeding the maximum three pilot provinces mandatorily prescribed in the 2010 PET Rules, is to change the rules of the PET in the middle of the proceedings just to accommodate protestant after he has failed to show a substantial recovery in the three pilot provinces he himself chose. <b>The last thing that this Tribunal should do is to change its rules in midstream to accommodate a party who has failed to comply with what Rule 65 of the 2010 PET Rules expressly requires.</b><br><br>I therefore vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the protest and counter-protest in PET Case No. 005. <br></jmment></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><jmment [to="" the="" compliance="" and="" urgent="" motion="" to="" defer="" payment="" of="" second="" installment="" additional="" cash="" deposit="" dated="" 13="" july="" 2017],="" <i=""><br></jmment></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><jmment [to="" the="" compliance="" and="" urgent="" motion="" to="" defer="" payment="" of="" second="" installment="" additional="" cash="" deposit="" dated="" 13="" july="" 2017],="" <i=""><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Agpalo, Ruben E., <i>Statutory Construction, </i>1990 Second Edition, p. 239, citing <i>Bersabel v.

The majority's decision today constitutes a refusal to apply the 2010 Rules of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET Rules) when no reason exists for exempting this Protest. <br><br><i> <b>Rule 65 is clear. </b></i> It states: <br><blockquote><br><b>RULE 65. <i> Dismissal; when proper. </i></b> - The Tribunal may require the protestant or counter-protestant to indicate, within a fixed period,<u> the province or provinces numbering not more than three, best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities</u> alleged in his petition; and the <u>revision of ballots and reception of evidence will begin with such provinces</u>. If upon examination of such ballots and proof, and after making reasonable allowances, the Tribunal is convinced that, taking all circumstances into account, the protestant or counter-protestant will most probably fail to make out his case, <u>the protest may forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces</u> mentioned in the protest. <br><br>The preceding paragraph shall also apply when the election protest involves correction of manifest errors. (R63) (Underscoring supplied) <br></blockquote><br>The parties and this Tribunal have operated on the fact that the proceedings after the Preliminary Conference shall be on the initial determination of the grounds of the Protest following Rule 65 of the PET Rules. Thus, as early as the Preliminary Conference Order, the Tribunal already explained the nature of the proceedings under this rule, as follows: </jmment><br><jmment [to="" the="" compliance="" and="" urgent="" motion="" to="" defer="" payment="" of="" second="" installment="" additional="" cash="" deposit="" dated="" 13="" july="" 2017],="" <i=""><blockquote>Rule 65 provides the Tribunal with a litmus test for protestant's grounds as raised in his Protest. Thus, protestant is given the opportunity to designate three provinces <b><u>which best exemplify</u></b> the frauds or irregularities raised in his Protest. These provinces constitute the "test cases" by which the Tribunal will make a determination as to whether it would proceed with the Protest — that is, retrieve and revise the ballots for all the remaining protested clustered precincts — or simply dismiss the Protest for failure of the protestant to make out his case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>The Tribunal invested countless number of hours following the mandate of Rule 65. The Tribunal retrieved thousands of ballot boxes from three provinces, revised millions of ballots, and ruled on each and every objection and claim of the parties on these millions of ballots.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> After all these, the Tribunal eventually arrived at a final tally: protestee Robredo garnered 14,436,325 votes, increasing her lead from 263,473 to 278,555 over protestant Marcos who obtained 14,157,770 votes. <br><br>Despite the clear and unequivocal results of the revision and appreciation shown above, the majority nonetheless refuses to strictly apply Rule 65. Instead, the majority directs the parties to comment on the results, and to submit their respective memoranda on the effect of the results on protestant's second and third causes of action, the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the third cause of action, and assuming it has jurisdiction, the threshold of evidence for the third cause of action, and other issues on how the Tribunal should act on the third cause of action. <br><br>The majority puts forward questions the answers to which are already obvious. By this failure to recognize the mandate, public purpose and wisdom of Rule 65's unequivocal directive, all the hard work and effort put into the revision and appreciation for the past three years are wasted. <br><br>Rule 65 is plain in its wording and no legal acrobatics are needed to decipher its meaning. It should be simply applied. It speaks of indicating three provinces "best exemplifying" the frauds and irregularities alleged in the Protest, and the revision and appreciation of ballots and/or reception of evidence will begin with such provinces. <br><br>The question faced by the Tribunal is simple: after making reasonable allowances, and taking all circumstances into account, will protestant most probably fail to make out his case, following the results of revision and appreciation of the ballots in the 5,415 clustered precincts in his pilot provinces? <br><br>Undoubtedly, protestant failed to make out his case. Why not apply Rule 65 now? <br><br>Following the language of Rule 65, protestant must show through his three chosen pilot provinces that his Protest has merit. The three pilot provinces must best exemplify the frauds and irregularities alleged in his Protest so that the Tribunal may proceed to the rest of the protested precincts. <br><br>Should protestant fail to make out a case, the Tribunal may dismiss the Protest without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in his Protest. <br><br>What is the measure of the merit of the Protest or any election protest, for that matter? Simple: it is a numbers game. It was protestant's burden to demonstrate to the Tribunal <u>through recovery of votes in his chosen pilot provinces</u> that he would most likely overcome protestee's lead. It was incumbent upon protestant to show through the three pilot provinces that the margin between him and protestee had decreased to such an extent that would convince the Tribunal to take a look at the rest of the protested precincts. <br><br>Here, the numbers clearly show that instead of narrowing the margin of votes between protestant and protestee, the margin even widened from 263,473 to 278,555. <br><br>It is therefore a <b><u>disservice to the PET Rules</u></b> to refuse to dismiss the Protest despite its clear and unmistakable lack of basis. Because from the results, what else is there to say and comment on? Under the PET Rules, how else is the Tribunal to decide? To my mind, asking the parties to comment on the foregoing clear and unequivocal results is a failure to terminate and dispose the Protest in a just, speedy, and expeditious manner, when a clear ground exists for its dismissal. <br><br>As far back as almost 30 years ago, the public interest involved in the speedy termination of an election contest was emphasized in the 1992 PET Rules: <br><blockquote><br><div align="center">&nbsp;<i> Dismissal</i><br></div><br>RULE 61.<b><u> As public interest demands the speedy termination of the contest</u>, the Tribunal may, after the issues have been joined, require the protestant to indicate, within a fixed period, the province or provinces numbering not more than three best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities alleged in his petition</b>; and the revision of ballots and reception of evidence will begin with such provinces. If upon examination of such ballots and proof, and after making reasonable allowances, the <b>Tribunal is convinced that, taking all the circumstances into account, the protestant will most probably fail to make out his case, the contest may forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in the contest</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied )</blockquote>In fact, Rule 2 of the 1992 PET Rules stated that "[i]n case of reasonable doubt, these rules shall be liberally construed in order to achieve a just, expeditious and inexpensive determination and disposition of every contest before the Tribunal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <br><br>In the 2005 PET Rules, Rule 63 was similarly worded as follows: </jmment><jmment [to="" the="" compliance="" and="" urgent="" motion="" to="" defer="" payment="" of="" second="" installment="" additional="" cash="" deposit="" dated="" 13="" july="" 2017],="" <i=""><blockquote><br><div align="center"><i> Initial Determination of the Grounds for Protest</i><br></div><br>RULE 63. <i>Dismissal; When Proper. </i> - <b>The Tribunal may require the protestant or counter-protestant to indicate, within a fixed period, the province or provinces numbering not more than three, best exemplifying the frauds or irregularities alleged in his petition</b>; and the revision of ballots and reception of evidence will begin with such provinces. If upon examination of such ballots and proof, and after making reasonable allowances,<b> the Tribunal is convinced that, taking all circumstances into account, the protestant or counter-protestant will most probably fail to make out his case, the protest may forthwith be dismissed, without further consideration of the other provinces mentioned in the protest</b>. <br><br>The preceding paragraph shall also apply when the election protest involves correction of manifest errors. <i> (R61a)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Emphasis supplied ) <br></blockquote><br>Rule 2 of the 2005 PET Rules also stated that "[t]he Rules shall be liberally construed to achieve a just, expeditious and inexpensive determination and disposition of every contest before the Tribunal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> This is replicated in Rule 3 of the PET Rules. <br><br>Thus, Rule 65 and the construction of the PET Rules implore the Tribunal to achieve a just and expeditious determination and disposition of every contest before it. Since the results clearly show protestant's failure to prove his case, why not dismiss the Protest now? Why is there a hesitation to strictly apply Rule 65? <br><br><b><i> There ts an underlying wisdom and public purpose in the requirement of pilot provinces in election protests. The Tribunal is duty bound to abide by it.</i></b><br><br>The use of pilot provinces is common among electoral tribunals. It is applied in election protests before the lower courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Commission on Elections (COMELEC),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Senate Electoral Tribunal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the House of&nbsp; Representatives Electoral Tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br>The dismissal of the protest for protestant's failure to make out a case under Rule 65 is not because of convenience. Indeed, given the divisiveness of elections, the purpose of an initial determination is to weed out protests that have no basis, most especially for a protest involving a national position. Given the massive logistical and administrative concerns, as well as the significant government resources and costs involved in an election protest for the national positions of President and Vice President, the Tribunal is only to proceed with the entire protested precincts and/or provinces if protestant is able to show to the Tribunal the need to look into the other provinces. On the other hand, if protestant fails to make out a case, the Tribunal must dismiss the Protest. <br><br>This is necessitated also by the fact that the choice of the pilot provinces was protestant's sole unfettered choice. He could have chosen any three provinces in any of his causes of action. In fact, his choice was not limited to three provinces for a particular cause of action. He could have chosen one province for his second cause of action and two provinces for his third cause of action, or vice versa. He could have, in fact, opted to limit the three provinces to his third cause of action. The permutations are numerous and the decision as to which permutation would best exemplify his cause rested solely on protestant. The only limitation was the number of pilot provinces -<b><u>not more than three.</u> </b> That protestant, the astute politician that he is, and represented by a well-recognized election lawyer, chose three provinces for his second cause of action which were all known bailiwicks of protestee, was his own legal gamble. <br><br>This Protest is a thorny and divisive issue that is of paramount importance to the nation, not just to the parties. And this is where the numbers are decisive. Numbers do not hold any feelings or political leanings. Numbers do not lie. They state things simply as they are. And when the numbers reveal a definite conclusion, the Tribunal would do a disservice to the public and to the nation not to heed the conclusion they provide. The majority cannot turn a blind eye to the numbers, when the figures here confirm that protestee indeed won by the slimmest of margins. The numbers also show that even with the provinces that protestant himself chose to be the ones that would best exemplify his Protest, the margin widened. <br><br>Again, I raise the question, what else is there to say and comment on? The language and purpose of Rule 65 are clear. The results of the revision and appreciation are likewise clear. Had this case been before any of the electoral tribunals, the protest would have been dismissed. What is stopping the majority from applying Rule 65? Why is this Protest being treated as <i> sui generis?</i><br><br>Directing the parties to comment on any matter or to conduct any further proceedings achieves no purpose. These are all an exercise in futility. Following Rule 65, the Protest should be dismissed and all pending motions of protestant, including but not limited to his <i>Motion for Technical Examination </i> dated July 10, 2017, <i>Protestant's Extremely Urgen Manifestation of Grave Concern with Omnibus Motion </i> dated December 10, 2018, and <i>Protestant's Extremely Urgent Motion to Set this Election Protest for Preliminary Conference</i> dated August 9, 2019 should be denied. <br><br>The Protest lives or dies by the results of the determination under Rule 65 of the PET Rules. Protestant is bound by his choice of pilot provinces. The Tribunal cannot accommodate protestant at the expense of violating its own rules. Protestant therefore has only himself to blame as the results of the revision and appreciation of millions of ballots in his three (3) pilot provinces only lead to one conclusion: the dismissal of his Protest. <br><br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> in accordance with Rule 65 of the PET Rules, I vote that the instant Election Protest be <b>DISMISSED </b>without further proceedings for lack of merit.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, Vol. XXXII, p. 24591.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> P.E.T.
