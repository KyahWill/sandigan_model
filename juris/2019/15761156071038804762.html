Considering that the Decision convicting the respondent of the crime of Estafa in Criminal Case No. 11787 is still pending resolution before the Supreme Court, the Commission shall not discuss said case in resolving the complaint.<br><br>In view of all the foregoing, it is respectfully recommended that ATTY. FRANCISCO R. LLAMAS be <b>Disbarred</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </blockquote><br><br>On September 8, 2006, the IBP Board of Governors issued Resolution No. XVII-2006-443<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; adopting and approving the report of CBP-IBP Commissioner San Juan, but modifying the penalty to suspension from the practice of law for one year.<br><br>The respondent moved for reconsideration, but the IBP Board of Governors denied the motion through Resolution No. XX-2013-693<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated June 20, 2013. However, for humanitarian reasons considering that the respondent was then already 82 years old at the time of resolution, the IBP Board of Governors lowered the penalty to suspension from the practice of law for six months.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><br>We agree with and uphold the findings and recommendation of the IBP Board of Governors.<br><br>A lawyer is first and foremost an officer of the court. As such, although he is required to serve his clients with utmost dedication, competence and diligence, his acts must always be within the bounds of law. Graver responsibility is imposed upon him than any other to uphold the integrity of the courts and show respect to their processes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Hence, any act on his part that obstructs, impedes and degrades the administration of justice constitutes professional misconduct necessitating the imposition of disciplinary sanctions against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In this case, the respondent did not live up to his duties and responsibilities as an officer of the court. We explain why.<br><br>Firstly, the respondent exhibited dishonesty and deceit in alleging in the petition for reconstitution that his clients had been the true and absolute owners of the property involved therein, and that such property had been free from all liens and encumbrances despite his knowledge that the ownership of the same was controversial and still the subject of several cases pending in the MTC and RTC in Lucena City.<br><br>Secondly, the respondent's act of instituting intestate proceedings involving the estate of the late Arsenio Lukang simultaneously in two courts of co-equal jurisdiction in the hope of obtaining a favorable ruling constituted a deliberate disregard of court processes that smacked of outright forum shopping and tended to unduly clog the courts' dockets. Further, he instituted the petition for letters of administration for the same estate despite the existence of a valid and binding extrajudicial settlement executed on August 5, 1976 by the heirs of the decedent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thereby, the respondent manifestly neglected his solemn vow under his <i>Lawyer's Oath</i> to act with all good fidelity to the courts and to maintain only such actions as appeared to him to be consistent with truth and honor.<br><br>Lastly, the respondent ignored his solemn duty under the <i>Lawyer's Oath</i> not to do any falsehood nor consent to its doing in court by noting in the records in Civil Case No. 89-87 of the RTC in Lucena City that he had received the order of non-suit only on February 14,&nbsp; 1993, which was contradicted by the certification of the postmaster of the Parañaque Post Office to the effect that he had received it on December 14, 1992.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>By the aforementioned acts, the respondent also violated Canon 10, Rule 10.01 and Rule 10.03 of the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility, viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>Canon 10 – A lawyer owes candor, fairness and good faith to the court.<br><br>Rule 10.01 – A lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the Court to be mislead by any artifice.<br><br>Rule 10.03 – A lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice.</blockquote><br><br>Anent the respondent's conviction for the crime of <i>other forms of swindling</i> as defined and punished under Article 316, paragraph 2, of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, the Court, through the resolution dated August 16, 2010,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> set aside its decision promulgated on September 29, 2009 in G.R. No. 149588 entitled <i>Francisco R. Llamas and Carmelita C. Llamas v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> thereby acquitting him of the crime charged for failure of the Prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The consequence of the reversal of the conviction and his resulting acquittal, according to <i>Interadent Zahntechnik, Phil., Inc. v. Francisco-Simbillo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; prevented the disbarment complaint based on the respondent attorney's moral turpitude from prospering.<br><br>We note, however, that this charge was not the first time that the respondent faced an administrative case and been held liable therefor. Earlier, in <i>Santos, Jr. v. Llamas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> he was suspended from the practice of law for one year for failure to pay his IBP dues and for making misrepresentations in the pleadings he filed in court.<br><br>Given his multiple infractions committed against the <i>Lawyer's Oath</i> and the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility</i>, the respondent's suspension from the practice of law for six months is proper and condign.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>SUSPENDS</b> respondent Atty. Francisco R. Llamas from the practice of law for six months effective upon receipt of this decision, with a<b> STERN WARNING</b> that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Let copies of this decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines; and the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all courts throughout the country.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Del Castillo, Jardeleza, Gesmundo,</i> and <i>Carandang, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (Vol. I), pp. 2-9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 67-70.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 104-105.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 118-122.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 2-4.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 11-14.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 4-5.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 5.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 6.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 7-8.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 8-9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 68-70.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 104.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 118-122.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Id. at 91-97.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Id. at 175-176.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (Vol. II), pp. 400-401.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Id. at 452.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Id. at 451.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Bantolo v.
