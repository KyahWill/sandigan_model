At pre-trial, Sacare and Lim changed their pleas to guilty, and were sentenced to rehabilitation for six (6) months at a government-recognized center. Only Lapi was subjected to trial on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>According to the prosecution, at around 1:50 p.m. on April 17, 2006, operatives of the Bacolod City Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Group conducted a stake-out operation in Purok Sigay, Barangay 2, Bacolod City. During the operation, Police Officer 2 Ronald Villeran (PO2 Villeran) heard noises from one (1) of the houses. He "peeped through its window"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and saw Lapi, Sacare, and Lim "having a pot session."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>PO2 Villeran tried to enter the house through the main door, but the door was locked.

He entered the room and introduced himself as a police officer. Lapi, Sacare, and Lim tried to escape, but were caught b PO2 Villeran's team members, who were waiting by the main door.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Having been arrested and their paraphernalia seized, the men were then brought to the City Anti-Illegal Drug Special Operation Task Group Office, where a police blotter was filed.

Another test conducted yielded the same results.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In his defense, Lapi alleged that on April 17, 2006, he was in Purok Sigay, Barangay 2, Bacolod City to deliver a mahjong set to a certain Antonio Kadunggo. On his way home, two (2) persons approached him and searched his pocket. They took his money, handcuffed him, and boarded him on a tricycle with four (4) other persons whom he did not know.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Lapi stated that upon reaching the Taculing Police Headquarters, he and the others were subjected to a drug test. They were then escorted to their detention cell without being informed of the test results. Rolando Cordova, a barbecue vendor in the area, corroborated Lapi's testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In its September 15, 2010 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Regional Trial Court found Lapi guilty.

Thus, he was justified and even obligated by law to subject him to drug screening laboratory examination."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Lapi filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> but it was denied by the Court of Appeals in its December 10, 2013 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Hence, Lapi filed this Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that while he raises factual questions, his case falls under the exceptions under the Rules of Court. He claims that the Court of Appeals' factual findings "are totally bereft of support in the records and so glaringly erroneous as to constitute a serious abuse of discretion."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Petitioner asserts that while he failed to question the validity of his arrest before entering his plea, his warrantless arrest was illegal from the start. Hence, any evidence obtained cannot be used against him. He argues that PO2 Villeran committed "a malevolent intrusion of privacy"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> when he peeped through the window; had he not done so, he would not see what the people in the house did.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He contends that this intrusion into his privacy "cannot be equated in plain view[;] therefore[,] petitioner cannot be considered caught <i>in flagrante delicto."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He submits that to "rule otherwise would be like giving authority to every police officer to intrude into the private homes of anyone in order to catch suspended drug offenders."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, counters that petitioner prays for a review of the facts and evidence, which is beyond the province of a petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It asserts that the warrantless arrest was valid, as "[t]he act of having a pot session is clearly the overt act required under the law, which indicates that petitioner is actually committing an offense."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It argues that what prompted PO2 Villeran to enter the house was not the noise from one (1) of the houses, but what he saw petitioner and his companions were doing in the house where they were apprehended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Further, respondent claims that since petitioner was not the owner of that house, he had no "reasonable expectation of privacy that must be upheld."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It submits that "[a] houseguest who was merely present in the house with the consent of the householder cannot claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in his host's home."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>This Court is asked to resolve the Issue of whether or not the warrantless arrest against petitioner Simeon M. Lapi was valid. However, this Court must first pass upon the procedural question of whether or not the Petition should be denied for raising questions of fact.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br>This Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> A petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court must, as a general rule, only raise questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Parties may only raise issues that can be determined without having to review or reevaluate the evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This Court generally gives weight to the factual findings of the lower courts "because of the opportunity enjoyed by the [lower courts] to observe the demeanor of the witnesses on the stand and assess their testimony."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In criminal cases, however, the accused has the constitutional right to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proven.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> To prove guilt, courts must evaluate the evidence presented in relation to the elements of the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, the finding of guilt is essentially a question of fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> For this reason, the entire records of a criminal case are thrown open for this Court's review. In <i>Ferrer v. People:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is a well-settled rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case wide open for review and that it becomes the duty of the Court to correct such errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from, whether they are assigned as errors or not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote><br><br>This Court is not precluded from reviewing the factual findings of the lower courts, or even arriving at a different conclusion, "if it is not convinced that [the findings] are conformable to the evidence of record and to its own impressions of the credibility of the witnesses."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The lower court actual findings will not bind this Court if facts that could affect the result of the case "were overlooked and disregarded[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>An examination of the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals shows no error that requires this Court's review. On this ground, the Petition can be outright dismissed.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>Even if this Court reviews the substantial merits of this case, the Petition is still denied. The Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the trial court's finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>A citizen's right to be secure against any unreasonable searches and seizures is sacrosanct. No less than the Constitution guarantees that the State cannot intrude into the citizen's persons, house, papers, and effects without a warrant issued by a judge finding probable cause:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article III<br>Bill of Rights</center><br><br>....<br><br>SECTION 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Constitution guarantees against "unreasonable" warrantless searches and seizures. This presupposes that the State may do so as long as they are reasonable. <i>People v.

He stated:<br><br><blockquote>While I was passing on that house and upon hearing that there was a noise inside the house, I peeped on the window and I was able to see three persons sitting with a small table on the middle of them, one of those person (sic) was holding an alumin[u]m foil which was rolled and was used as a straw and placed on his mouth while there was another foil with a lighted lighter in the bottom of that foil with the fume from that foil he was sniffing through his mouth and after that he passed that aluminum foil from him to another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner was arrested and subjected to drug testing. When he tested positive for shabu, he was subsequently charged with having violated Article II, Section 15 of Republic Act No. 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 15. Use of Dangerous Drugs. — A person apprehended or arrested, who is found to be positive for use of any dangerous drug, after a confirmatory test, shall be imposed a penalty of a minimum of six (6) months rehabilitation in a goverrnnent center for the first offense, subject to the provisions of Article VIII of this Act. If apprehended using any dangerous drug for the second time, he/she shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years and a fine ranging from Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) to Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00): Provided, That this Section shall not be applicable where the person tested is also found to have in his/her possession such quantity of any dangerous drug provided for under Section 11 of this Act, in which case the provisions stated therein shall apply.</blockquote><br><br>Petitioner argues that his warrantless arrest was illegal since PO2 Villeran had to peep through the window to ascertain that something illegal was occurring. He posits that his case is similar to that of <i>People v. Bolasa.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In <i>Bolasa,</i> the police were tipped off by an informant that people were packing drugs in a certain house. Upon reaching it, the police officers peeked into a window, where they saw a man and a woman repacking marijuana. The officers entered the house, introduced themselves as police officers, and arrested the pair. This Court held that the arrests and the subsequent searches and seizures were invalid as the arresting officers had no personal knowledge that the people in the house were committing a crime.<br><br>Here, however, petitioner admits that he failed to question the validity of his arrest before arraignment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> He did not move to quash the Information against him before entering his plea.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> He was assisted by counsel when he entered his plea.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Likewise, he was able to present his evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In <i>People v. Alunday:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Court has consistently ruled that any objection involving a warrant of arrest or the procedure for the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction over the person of the accused must be made before he enters his plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived. We have also ruled that an accused may be estopped from assailing the illegality of his arrest if he fails to move for the quashing of the information against him before his arraignment. And since the legality of an arrest affects only the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the accused, any defect in the arrest of the accused may be deemed cured when he voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the trial court. We have also held in a number of cases that the illegal arrest of an accused is not a sufficient cause for setting aside a valid judgment rendered upon a sufficient complaint after a trial free from error; such arrest does not negate the validity of the conviction of the accused.<br><br>Herein, accused-appellant went into arraignment and entered a plea of not guilty. Thereafter, he actively participated in his trial. He raised the additional issue of irregularity of his arrest only during his appeal to this Court. He is, therefore, deemed to have waived such alleged defect by submitting himself to the jurisdiction of the court by his counsel-assisted plea during his arraignment; by his actively participating in the trial and by not raising the objection before his arraignment.<br><br>It is much too late in the day to complain about the warrantless arrest after a valid information has been filed, the accused arraigned, trial commenced and completed, and a judgment of conviction rendered against him.<br><br>Accused-appellant was not even denied due process by virtue of his alleged illegal arrest, because of his voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the trial court, as manifested by the voluntary and counsel­ assisted plea he entered during arraignment and by his active participation in the trial thereafter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In <i>Bolasa,</i> the accused were charged with possession of illegal drugs. This Court not only contended with the validity of the warrantless arrest, but also examined the validity of the subsequent search of the accused and the seizure of items in their possession. As with certain constitutional rights,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the right to question the validity of a warrantless arrest can be waived. This waiver, however, does not carry with it a waiver of the inadmissibility of the evidence seized during the illegal arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioner does not deny that his drug test yielded positive for illegal drugs. What he questions is the alleged illegality of his arrest.<br><br>Petitioner, however, has already waived the right to question the validity of his arrest. No items were seized from him during his arrest as he was not charged with possession or sale of illegal drugs. Thus the trial court and the Court of Appeals did not err in finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt in violation of Article II, Section 15 of Republic Act No. 9165.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b> the Petition is <b>DENIED. </b>The April 29, 2013 Decision and December 10, 2013 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
