After the exchange of pleadings, the LA ruled that petitioner was illegally dismissed. The dispositive portion of the LA Decision states:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>,&nbsp; premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the complainant to have been illegally dismissed by the respondents as a regular employee. Conformably, respondent Kalookan Slaughter House and its owner, respondent Ernesto N. Cunanan, are hereby ordered, jointly and severally, to pay the complainant backwages computed from [the] time of dismissal until finality of this Decision and separation pay, which equivalent (sic)&nbsp; to one (1)&nbsp; month salary per year of service, counted from time of engagement until finality of this Decision.<br><br>As of this date, complainant's backwages and separation pay are tentatively computed at P84,500.00 and P260,000.00, respectively.<br><br>Respondents Kalookan Slaughter House and Ernesto N. Cunanan are further ordered, jointly and severally, to pay the complainant the following:<br><blockquote><table width="80%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="307" valign="top"><div>Service Incentive Leave Pay </div> </td> <td width="87" valign="top"><div align="center">-</div></td> <td width="101" valign="top"><div> p </div></td> <td width="171" valign="top"><div align="right">7,500.00 </div> </td> <td width="455" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="307" valign="top"><div> 13<sup>th</sup> Month Pay </div></td> <td width="87" valign="top"><div align="center">-</div></td> <td width="101" valign="top"><div>&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="171" valign="top"><div align="right"> 39,000.00 </div></td> <td width="455" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="307" valign="top"><div> Night Shift Differential </div></td> <td width="87" valign="top"><div align="center">-</div></td> <td width="101" valign="top"><div>&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="171" valign="top"><div align="right"> 1,462.50 </div></td> <td width="455" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="307" valign="top"><div> Attorney's Fees </div></td> <td width="87" valign="top"><div align="center">-</div></td> <td width="101" valign="top"><div>&nbsp; </div></td> <td width="171" valign="top"><div align="right"> 39,246.25 </div></td> <td width="455" valign="top">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote>All other claims are denied.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>The LA found that the requisites of an employer-employee relationship were established as follows: petitioner was hired by Kalookan Slaughterhouse through Tablit and petitioner was paid his daily wage for his butchering services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; Further, Kalookan Slaughterhouse had authority to discipline petitioner as regards his work activities through Kalookan Slaughterhouse's personnel named Noelberto De Guzman (De&nbsp;&nbsp; Guzman).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kalookan Slaughterhouse also exercised control over the conduct of petitioner in the performance of his work and implemented policies regulating his rendition of services. In fact, De Guzman admitted to the strict policies imposed by Kalookan Slaughterhouse such as the requirement of I.D.s, uniforms, and even where butchering knives are inserted. According to De Guzman, petitioner violated all of these.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The policies implemented showed that petitioner could not render butchering services following his own ways and means. The LA also found that petitioner presented his I.D. issued by Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse,&nbsp; which&nbsp; proved&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; was&nbsp; an&nbsp; employee&nbsp; of Kalookan Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The LA also ruled that Kalookan Slaughterhouse failed to prove its claim that petitioner was not its employee. The LA ruled that Kalookan Slaughterhouse failed to prove that Tablit, who was its employee, was an independent or job contractor. As its Operations Supervisor, Tablit was deemed to have acted in the interest of Kalookan Slaughterhouse. And since Tablit engaged petitioner, petitioner is deemed an employee of Kalookan Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The LA thus found that petitioner was illegally dismissed when he was told on July 22, 2014 that he could no longer work due to his old age. For the LA, this was not a just or valid cause to terminate&nbsp; petitioner's employment and&nbsp; it was&nbsp; an&nbsp; arbitrary&nbsp; and&nbsp; whimsical&nbsp; act of Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Given the foregoing, petitioner was entitled to backwages and separation pay. Petitioner was also entitled to service incentive leave pay, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, and night shift differential pay as Kalookan Slaughterhouse failed to prove that petitioner was paid the foregoing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><u><i>NLRC Decision</i></u><br><br>Aggrieved, Kalookan Slaughterhouse appealed to the NLRC, which reversed the LA. The dispositive portion of the NLRC Decision states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premised on all the foregoing considerations, the Decision appealed from is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> and a new one is entered <b>DISMISSING</b>&nbsp; the above-entitled case for lack of employer-Â­employee relationship.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>The NLRC&nbsp; ruled that although&nbsp; there was a semblance of employer-employee&nbsp; relationship as the work of a butcher&nbsp; is necessary and desirable in the usual trade and business of a slaughterhouse, the facts and circumstances in this case&nbsp; showed&nbsp; that there&nbsp; was no employer-employee relationship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The NLRC ruled that it was normal and usual practice in slaughterhouses to engage&nbsp; the services&nbsp; of butchers on a contractual or per piece basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Petitioner was an independent&nbsp; contractor&nbsp; and not an employee of Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse because there was no regular&nbsp; payroll showing his name and the legal deductions made from his salary.&nbsp; There&nbsp; were also no pay slips, and the money he received from Tablit showed that he was an independent&nbsp; butcher&nbsp; and not an employee&nbsp; of Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]&nbsp; </sup>The NLRC found that the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> of Tablit&nbsp; tends&nbsp; to show that there&nbsp; was no employer-employee relationship between&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; and Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; The NLRC also ruled that petitioner&nbsp; failed to prove any dismissal&nbsp; as he was only barred&nbsp; from entering&nbsp; the premises&nbsp; for his failure&nbsp; to follow&nbsp; the slaughterhouse's policies,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; but nonetheless ruled that there was just cause to dismiss&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; as he was found sleeping&nbsp; on duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><u><i>CA Decision</i></u><br><br>Petitioner questioned the NLRC Decision to the CA through a petition for <i>certiorari</i>. The CA, however, denied the petition. The dispositive portion of the CA&nbsp; Decision states:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is denied for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>The CA ruled that petitioner's claim of the existence of an employerÂ­ employee relationship is not supported by substantial evidence as he failed to submit salary vouchers, pay slips, daily work schedule and even a certificate of withholding tax on compensation income.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The CA found that the gate passes and log sheets that petitioner submitted were not sufficient as the gate passes specifically state that they do not qualify the holder as an employee of Kalookan Slaughterhouse and the log sheets were only for services from September 24 and 28, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The CA also ruled that petitioner failed to disprove the Sinumpaang Salaysay of Tablit that petitioner was one of the butchers that Tablit personally hired and paid when there were too many hogs to be butchered at the slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the CA denied this. Hence, this Petition.<br><br><div align="CENTER"><b>Issues</b></div><br>The issues raised in the Petition are as follows:<br><blockquote><div align="CENTER">I</div><br>WHETHER THE [CA] COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN AFFIRMING THE NLRC DECISION AND RESOLUTION WHICH FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS AN EMPLOYERÂ­ EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP&nbsp; BETWEEN&nbsp; THE&nbsp; PETITIONER&nbsp; AND THE RESPONDENTS.<br><br><div align="CENTER">II</div><br>WHETHER THE [CA] COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR IN AFFIRMING THE NLRC DECISION AND RESOLUTION WHICH FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WAS AN ILLEGAL DISMISSAL IN THE INSTANT CASE.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote><br><div align="CENTER">The Court's Ruling</div><br>The Petition is granted.<br><br>The conflicting factual findings of the LA vis-a-vis the NLRC and the CA warrant a review of the factual t1ndings of the labor tribunals and the CA.

Petitioner would also sometimes come to work with dirty clothes, and there was one time he caught petitioner sleeping.

These elements or indicators comprise the so-called 'four-fold' test of employment relationship."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, it is undisputed that petitioner rendered butchering services&nbsp; at&nbsp; Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse.&nbsp; The&nbsp; LA&nbsp; found&nbsp; that&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; was engaged&nbsp; by Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse&nbsp; itself since&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; log sheets and gate passes. The NLRC and the CA, however, ruled that petitioner was only engaged by Tablit,&nbsp; Kalookan Slaughterhouse's Operation Supervisor,&nbsp; and he was Tablit's&nbsp;&nbsp; own&nbsp; employee.&nbsp; This was supported by Tablit's<i> Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>.<br><br>The Court finds that the NLRC and the CA committed a grave error and agrees with the LA.<br><br>Similar to the facts of this case, the Court in <i>Masonic Contractor, Inc. v.&nbsp; Madjos</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; (<i>Masonic&nbsp;&nbsp; Contractor</i>)&nbsp; ruled&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; company provided identification cards and uniforms and the vague affidavit of the purported&nbsp; employer were&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove&nbsp; the&nbsp; existence&nbsp; of employer-employee relationship. Thus:<br><blockquote>Petitioners' defense that they merely contracted the services of respondents through Malibiran fails to persuade us. The facts of this case show that respondents have been under the employ of MCI as early as 1991. They were hired not to perform a specific job or undertaking. Instead, they were employed as all-around laborers doing varied and intermittent jobs, such&nbsp; as&nbsp; those&nbsp; of&nbsp; drivers,&nbsp; sweepers,&nbsp; gardeners,&nbsp; and&nbsp; even&nbsp; undertakers or <i>tagalibing</i>,&nbsp; until they were arbitrarily terminated by MCI in 2004. Their wages were paid directly by MCI, as evidenced by the latter's payroll summary, belying its self-serving and unsupported contention that it paid directly to Malibiran for respondents' services. Respondents had identification cards or gate passes issued not by Malibiran, but by MCI, and were required to wear uniforms bearing MCI's emblem or logo when they reported for work.<br><br>It is common practice for companies to provide identification cards to individuals not only as a security measure, but more importantly to identify the bearers thereof as <i>bona fide</i> employees of the firm or institution that issued them. The provision of company-issued identification cards and uniforms to respondents, aside from their inclusion in MCI's summary payroll, indubitably constitutes substantial evidence sufficient to support only one conclusion: that respondents were indeed employees of MCI.<br><br>Moreover, as correctly observed by the CA, petitioners failed to show that it was Malibiran who exercised control over the means and methods of the work assigned to respondents. Interestingly, Malibiran's affidavit is silent on the aspect of control over respondents'&nbsp; means and methods of work. Rather than categorically stating that she was the one who directly employed respondents to render work for MCI, Malibiran merely implies that, like respondents, she was just a co-worker. Malibiran's statement that the work for MCI was merely in the nature of accommodation to help respondents earn a living, in effect, impliedly admits the fact that she did not have the capacity to engage in the independent job-contracting business, and that, therefore, she was not respondents' employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </blockquote>Here,&nbsp; the&nbsp; totality&nbsp; of&nbsp; petitioner's&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; admissions&nbsp; of Kalookan Slaughterhouse&nbsp; convinces the Court that petitioner was indeed an employee of Kalookan Slaughterhouse. Petitioner was able to present an LD., gate&nbsp; passes,&nbsp; log&nbsp; sheets,&nbsp; and&nbsp; a&nbsp; trip&nbsp; ticket.&nbsp; Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse&nbsp; even admitted through De Guzman that uniforms were given to all personnel, including petitioner.<br><br>The CA, however, disregarded&nbsp; the gate passes, as it claimed that the gate pass had a note that such did not qualify the holder as an employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>This is an error as this only applied to one of the gate passes and the other gate passes did not have this notation.<br><br>Further, petitioner was able to submit an I.D. in addition to the gate passes. The trip ticket and the log sheets also showed that Kalookan Slaughterhouse&nbsp; engaged&nbsp; petitioner.&nbsp; These&nbsp; are&nbsp; sufficient&nbsp; to&nbsp; prove&nbsp; that petitioner was engaged by Kalookan Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Kalookan Slaughterhouse, however, attempts to show that even if petitioner worked in the slaughterhouse, he was Tablit's employee. Tablit claims to be an employee of the slaughterhouse for more or less 20 years and that&nbsp;&nbsp; he&nbsp;&nbsp; has&nbsp;&nbsp; engaged&nbsp;&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp;&nbsp; as&nbsp;&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; his&nbsp;&nbsp; butchers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kalookan Slaughterhouse further alleged that petitioner's salaries were paid by Tablit. Kalookan Slaughterhouse, however, failed to prove this. In fact, Tablit was not shown to possess substantial capital and investment to have an independent business, be petitioner's&nbsp; employer and pay his salaries. Other than Tablit's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>, no document was presented to show that he paid petitioner's salaries.<br><br>Further, by denying that petitioner was its employee but alleging that he rendered services as Tablit's employee, Kalookan Slaughterhouse effectively admitted the substantial fact that petitioner has been rendering butchering services for 20 years from the filing of the complaint on August 5, 2014. As the Court held in <i>Pamplona Plantation Company v. Acosta</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x Petitioner is estopped from denying that respondents worked for it. In the first place, it never raised this defense in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter. Notably, the defense it raised pertained to the nature of respondents'&nbsp;&nbsp; employment, <i>i.e</i>.,&nbsp; whether&nbsp; they&nbsp; are&nbsp; seasonal&nbsp; employees, contractors,&nbsp; or&nbsp; worked&nbsp; under the pakyaw system.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; in&nbsp; its&nbsp; Position Paper, petitioner alleged that some of the respondents are coconut filers and copra hookers or <i>sakadors</i>; some are seasonal employees who worked as scoopers or <i>lugiteros</i>;&nbsp; some are contractors; and some worked under the pakyaw system. In support of these allegations, petitioner even presented the company's payroll, which will allegedly prove its allegations.<br><br>By setting forth these defenses, petitioner, in effect, admitted that respondents worked for it, albeit in different capacities. Such allegations are negative&nbsp; pregnants&nbsp; - <b><u>denials&nbsp;&nbsp; pregnant&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; admission&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the substantial facts&nbsp; in the pleading&nbsp; responded&nbsp; to which are not squarely denied, and&nbsp; amounts to an&nbsp; acknowledgement that&nbsp; respondents were indeed employed by petitioner</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </blockquote><br>Even worse for Kalookan Slaughterhouse, while Tablit claimed to be petitioner's employer, he also admitted that he did not exercise any control over the means and methods of petitioner in rendering butchering services. If he was indeed petitioner's employer, he should have control over petitioner's means and methods for doing his job.<br><br>It,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; appears&nbsp; on&nbsp; record&nbsp; that&nbsp; De&nbsp; Guzman,&nbsp; who&nbsp; is&nbsp; also&nbsp; an employee&nbsp; of Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse,&nbsp; was the one who exercised control over&nbsp; petitioner's means&nbsp; and methods&nbsp; as he reprimanded&nbsp; petitioner&nbsp; for his failure to properly store his butchering knives, coming to Kalookan Slaughterhouse&nbsp; with dirty clothes, reporting for work drunk, and not having an I.D. before going to the slaughterhouse.<br><br>All the foregoing show that Kalookan Slaughterhouse,&nbsp; through Tablit, was the one who engaged petitioner, paid for his salaries, and in effect had the power to dismiss&nbsp; him. Further, Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse&nbsp; exercised&nbsp; control over petitioner's conduct through De Guzman. To the mind of the Court, Kalookan Slaughterhouse was petitioner's employer and it exercised its rights as an employer through Tablit and De Guzman, who were its employees.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner was illegally dismissed and<br>entitled to his money claims.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner claims that on July 22, 2014 he was callously informed that he could no longer report for work because of his old age.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Kalookan Slaughterhouse,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; claims that petitioner&nbsp; was not dismissed&nbsp; but was only barred from entering as he failed to comply with the "No I.D., No Entry" Policy and the "No Uniform, No Entry" Policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The LA ruled that petitioner's allegation of dismissal was unrebutted as De Guzman only attested to several instances where petitioner was reprimanded for his failure to comply with the slaughterhouse's policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> For the LA, De Guzman did not state that on July 22, 2014 he had barred petitioner from entering for his failure to comply with the policies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The NLRC believed Kalookan Slaughterhouse&nbsp; that petitioner was not allowed to enter since he failed to comply with the slaughterhouse's policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; The CA did not discuss the issue of dismissal as it ruled that petitioner was not an employee of Kalookan Slaughterhouse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The Court finds that the LA was correct in ruling that petitioner was illegally dismissed.<br><br>Indeed,&nbsp; Kalookan&nbsp; Slaughterhouse&nbsp; failed to specifically&nbsp; deny that on July 22, 2014, petitioner was informed that he could no longer report for work.

As the Court held in Masonic Contractors:<br><blockquote>x x x By their silence, petitioners are deemed to have admitted the same.
