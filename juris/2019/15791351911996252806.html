Rabon at Rosario, La Union. SPO1 Ofiaza and PO1 Fernandez went inside Ortega's store while SPO1 Vargas and the informant waited for appellant outside. Appellant texted the informant that he was on his way to their meeting place. The team then saw appellant alight from a white Mitsubishi L-300 cab which halted 20 meters away from the store. Appellant walked toward SPO1 Vargas and informant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The informant introduced SPO1 Vargas to appellant as the person interested in buying shabu. Appellant asked SPO1 Vargas about the money but the latter requested to see the shabu first. Appellant then handed to SPO1 Vargas one (1) heat sealed transparent plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance.

The prosecution had established the integrity and identity of the <i>corpus delicti </i>from the time it was seized until it was presented as evidence in court. It further held the presence of the media and DOJ representatives for the inventory and photograph of seized items was not indispensable for the prosecution of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals</b></center><br><br>On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court when it allegedly overlooked fatal omissions of the police team during the supposed buy-bust operation, <i>viz: </i>the marking was not done immediately upon the seizure of the alleged dangerous drug; and the seized items were not placed in a separate container nor sealed before its transfer to the crime laboratory. Also, except for her receipt of the request for laboratory examination and the results of the same, there was no showing how forensic chemist PSI Manuel actually handled the specimen before, during, and after the examination. Therefore, there was no proof that the specimen received for chemical examination was the same substance tested, stored, and presented in court as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>For its part, the People, through Assistant Solicitor General Derek R. Puertollano and Associate Solicitor Andres S. Jose Jr., countered in the main: 1) the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were all sufficiently established; 2) the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions and duties in favor of the buy-bust team prevails over appellant's denial; 3) the marking, inventory, and photography in the presence of appellant and the three (3) barangay officials substantially complied with the requirements of the chain of custody rule; and 4) the integrity and evidentiary value of seized items were properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></center><br><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated August 17, 2017, the Court of Appeals affirmed.

The prosecution is, therefore, tasked to establish that the substance illegally possessed by the accused is the same substance presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <i><b>first</b></i>, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i><b>second,</b></i> the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i><b>third, </b></i>the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; <i>and <b>fourth, </b></i>the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>This is the chain of custody rule. It came to fore due to the unique characteristics of illegal drugs which render them indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering, alteration, or substitution either by accident or otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Section 21 of RA 9165 prescribes the standard in preserving the <i>corpus delicti </i>in illegal drug cases, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote><b>Section 21. </b><i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. â€“ </i>The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, <b>immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; </b>(emphasis added)</blockquote><div align="center"><br></div><div align="center">xxxx</div></blockquote><br><br>The Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 further commands:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 21. </b>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, <b>physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: </b>Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; <b>Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items. </b>(emphases added)</blockquote><br><br>Here, the inventory and photograph of seized items were only made in the presence of appellant and three barangay officials, <i>i.e., </i>â€“Edgar Cabunias (barangay tanod), Victor Lopez (barangay tanod) and Eduardo Peralta (barangay chairman).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This fact was confirmed by SPO1 Vargas and SPO1 Ofiaza in their testimony before the trial court, thus:<br><br><blockquote><u>SPO1 Vargas:</u><br>Q: So you were the person who also conducted the inventory?<br><br>A: yes, sir.<br><br><div align="left">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx </div><br><br>Q: And who was present during the inventory you conducted?<br><br>A: Brgy.

The arresting officers failed to give any justifiable explanation for the absence of these witnesses. The insulating presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> More, they failed to perform their positive duty to secure through earnest efforts the presence of these representatives. This is certainly a serious lapse of procedure.<br><br>In <i><b>People v. Abelarde,</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the accused was acquitted for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 because there was no evidence that the inventory and photograph of seized dangerous drugs, if at all, were done in the presence of a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.<br><br><b>In </b><i><b>People v. Macud,</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the buy-bust team similarly failed to secure the presence of a media representative, a DOJ representative, and any elected public official to witness the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs. For this, the Court rendered a verdict of acquittal.<br><br>Finally in <i><b>People v. AÃ±o,</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the prosecution offered no explanation to justify the absence of representatives from the media and the DOJ during the inventory and photograph of seized dangerous drugs. The Court ruled that the unjustified gaps in the chain of custody went against the finding of guilt against the accused.<br><br>Another gap in the chain of custody happened when the seized drug was delivered to the crime laboratory. There was nothing on record here showing how the seized drug was handled before, during, and after it came to the custody of forensic chemist PSI Manuel's possession. The parties merely stipulated that PSI Manuel received the specimens and found the same positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. But as to how PSI Manuel took precautionary steps in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drug while it remained in her possession and prior to its presentation in court, no evidence was ever presented.<br><br>In <i><b>People v. Hementiza,</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court acquitted the accused for illegal sale of drugs because records were bereft of any evidence on how the illegal drugs were brought to the court. The forensic chemist therein merely testified that she made a report confirming the substance contained in the sachets brought to her was positive for shabu. As in this case, there was no evidence how the shabu was stored, preserved, labeled or who had custody thereof before it was presented in court.<br><br>The breaches in chain of custody rule here were fatal flaws effectively destroying the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti.</i><br><br>We have clarified that a perfect chain of custody may be impossible to obtain at all times because of varying field conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> offers a saving clause allowing leniency under justifiable grounds. There are twin conditions for the saving clause to apply: a) the prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses; and, b) the integrity and value of seized evidence had been preserved. A justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Here, prosecution utterly failed to offer any explanation which would otherwise excuse the buy-bust team's failure to comply with the chain of custody rule. Thus, the condition for the saving clause to apply was not complied with.<br><br><b><i>People v. Crispo</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> is apropos:<br><br><blockquote><b>An examination of the records reveals that while the inventory and photography of the seized items were made in the presence of two (2) elected public officials, </b><i>i.e., </i>Barangay Kagawads Ramon Amtolim and Helen Tolentino, as evidenced by their signatures on the Receipt of Property/Evidence Seized, <b>the same were not done in the presence of representatives from either the DOJ and the media.</b><br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br><br>In this case, <b>despite the non-observance of the witness requirement, no plausible explanation was given by the prosecution.</b><br><br>Verily, the procedural lapses committed by the arresting officers, which were unfortunately left unjustified, militate against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt against Crispo, as the <b>integrity and evidentiary value of the </b><i><b>corpus delicti </b></i><b>had been compromised, </b>xxx <u><b>As such, since the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for noncompliance with the aforesaid provision, Crispo's acquittal is perforce in order.</b></u><br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>So must it be.<br><br>Suffice it to state that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> cannot substitute for compliance and mend the broken links. There can be no presumption of regularity in this case when records were replete with details of the policemen's serious lapses. For to allow the presumption to prevail notwithstanding clear errors on the part of the police is to negate the safeguards precisely placed by law to ensure that no abuse is committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Here, the presumption was amply overturned by compelling evidence of the serious breaches of the chain of custody rule.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY, </b>the appeal is <b>GRANTED. </b>The Decision dated August 17, 2017 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
