				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">While this Court's power to cite persons in contempt should be used sparingly, it should be wielded to ensure the infallibility of justice where the defiance or disobedience is patent and contumacious that there is an evident refusal to obey.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In criminal contempt proceedings, the presumption of innocence exists. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is but necessary; absent this, the accused cannot be cited in contempt.<br><br>This Court resolves a Petition for Indirect Contempt<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The case was filed against officers of the National Bureau of Investigation, namely: (1) Director Magtanggol B. Gatdula (Gatdula); (2) former Director Carlos S.

People</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In that case, Hubert Jeffrey P. Webb (Webb), among others, was charged with the crime of rape with homicide for allegedly raping Carmela Vizconde (Carmela), then killing her, her mother, and her sister in 1991— the events of which had been infamously called the Vizconde Massacre.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>While the criminal case was pending before the trial court, Webb filed a Motion to Direct the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to Submit Semen Specimen to DNA Analysis.&nbsp; As he claims in his Petition, the DNA testing would establish his innocence since the results would show that the semen found in Carmela did not belong to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; When the Motion was denied, Webb filed a Petition for Certiorari assailing the denial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In an April 20, 2010 Resolution, this Court granted Webb’s request to order a testing on the semen specimen found in Carmela’s cadaver, in view of the Rules on DNA Evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; It ordered the National Bureau of Investigation to assist the parties in submitting the semen specimen to the University of the Philippines Natural Science Research Institute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>This Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in the higher interest of justice, the request of appellant Webb to submit for DNA analysis the semen specimen taken from the cadaver of Carmela Vizconde under the custody of the National Bureau of Investigation is hereby GRANTED.&nbsp; The NBI is ORDERED to ASSIST the parties in facilitating the submission of said specimen to the UP-Natural Science and Research Institute, Diliman, Quezon City and they (NBI and UP-NSRI) are further ORDERED to REPORT to this Court within fifteen (15) days from notice hereof regarding compliance with and implementation of this Resolution.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In&nbsp; its&nbsp; Compliance&nbsp; and&nbsp; Manifestation dated&nbsp; April&nbsp; 27,&nbsp; 2010,&nbsp; the National Bureau of Investigation claimed that the semen specimen was no longer in its custody. It alleged that the specimen had been submitted as evidence to the trial court when its Medico-Legal Chief, Dr. Cabanayan, testified on January 30, 31, and February 1, 5, 6, and 7, 1996.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The trial court denied this claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; The Branch Clerk of Court explained that what were marked in evidence were photographs of the slides containing the vaginal smear, not the slides themselves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>However, in a Certification dated April 23, 1997, Dr. Bautista of the National Bureau of Investigation’s Medico-Legal Division confirmed that the slides containing the specimen were still in the Bureau’s custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>When required by this Court to explain the discrepancies, the National Bureau of Investigation filed its Compliance dated July 16, 2010.&nbsp; In its Compliance,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Cabanayan&nbsp; explained&nbsp; that&nbsp; he&nbsp; submitted&nbsp; the&nbsp; semen specimen to the trial court during his direct and cross-examinations.&nbsp; Dr. Bautista, denying responsibility, clarified that he issued the certification based on the information given to him by the medical technologist of the Bureau’s Pathology Section.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Due to the missing semen specimen, Webb filed this Petition for Indirect Contempt. He prays that the impleaded former and current National Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Investigation&nbsp; officers&nbsp; be&nbsp; cited&nbsp; for&nbsp; indirect&nbsp; contempt&nbsp; for “impeding, degrading, and obstructing the administration of justice and for disobeying the April 20, 2010 Resolution of this Honorable Court[.]”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner argues that the National Bureau of Investigation’s claims are belied by the records of the case.&nbsp; He points out that based on the prosecution’s Formal Offer of Evidence, the exhibits submitted to the trial court were only photographs of the slides containing the specimen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In addition, petitioner alleges that it was not mentioned during respondent Dr. Cabanayan’s testimony that he turned over the actual slides to&nbsp; the&nbsp; court.&nbsp; On&nbsp; February&nbsp; 5,&nbsp; 1996,&nbsp; when&nbsp; the&nbsp; defense&nbsp; requested&nbsp; the production of the actual slides, the prosecution merely promised to bring them on the next hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; When he was asked the following day, Dr. Cabanayan stated that he “forgot all about”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the slides.&nbsp; On his last appearance on February 7, 1996, he still failed to submit the sperm specimen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Dr. Cabanayan’s claim, petitioner submits, is also belied by the court records, among which was respondent Dr. Bautista’s certification that the specimen was still in the Bureau’s custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; He further argues that respondent Dr. Bautista’s attempt to abandon his initial certification should be doubted as it is not supported by competent evidence. For one, he did not identify the medical technologist who supposedly fed him the information. Assuming that&nbsp; his&nbsp; story&nbsp; were&nbsp; true,&nbsp; he&nbsp; forwarded no&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; that&nbsp; the medical technologist lied to him, petitioner points out.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In essence, petitioner claims that the National Bureau of Investigation made a false report to this Court when it stated that it had submitted the specimen to the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The testimony and certification from respondents Dr. Cabanayan and Dr. Bautista, respectively, show that the Bureau, not the trial court, had the last custody of the specimen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further faults the National Bureau of Investigation for its apparent lack of care and concern in preserving the vital piece of evidence. He claims that since a Motion to direct the Bureau to submit the semen specimen for DNA analysis was pending, the Bureau should have been more diligent in handling the specimen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Yet, it has been nonchalant, as evinced by respondent Dr. Bautista’s negligence when he admitted that he did not personally check if the slides were still in their custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In addition, petitioner asserts that the National Bureau of Investigation devised a deliberate scheme to falsely inculpate him and his co-accused.<br><br>First, he questions its reliance on its star witness, Jessica Alfaro (Alfaro), whom he claims to be a bogus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Petitioner contends that Alfaro was&nbsp; a&nbsp; regular&nbsp; informant&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Investigation who declared that she knew someone who witnessed the killings.&nbsp; When she failed to produce the supposed eyewitness, Alfaro allegedly volunteered herself to be the witness despite lack of personal knowledge of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also submits that the National Bureau of Investigation knew that Alfaro’s testimonies were inconsistent on several material points.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In her first affidavit, Alfaro admitted that she did not witness the crime’s actual commission as she was a mere lookout; yet, in her second affidavit, she suddenly claimed being in the Vizconde residence and witnessing Carmela’s rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; To cover up the inconsistencies, Alfaro admitted to the Bureau that she shredded her first affidavit, which was only recovered from Alfaro’s assisting lawyer, Atty. Arturo Mercader (Atty. Mercader).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, the Bureau admitted that Alfaro identified the wrong person for accused Miguel Rodriguez.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Alfaro also lied when she stated that she was not assisted by counsel when she executed the first affidavit, when she was, in fact, actually assisted by Atty. Mercader.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner argues that Alfaro is not a reliable witness, as supported by her being a self-confessed drug addict.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also implicates respondents Attys. Figueras and Rivera, claiming that they coached Alfaro in the dubious execution of the second affidavit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; He highlights that Alfaro did not actually know him until respondent Agent Herra and Agent Mark Anthony So (So) coached her into identifying him in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; He insists that while Alfaro presented herself as his close friend or <i>barkada</i>, she did not actually know him or how he looked like prior to the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also alleges that National Bureau of Investigation Director Antonio Aragon (Antonio) tried to convince his nephew, Honesto Aragon (Honesto), not to testify that he was with petitioner in the United States at the time the crime was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; In his testimony, Honesto admitted that his uncle, Antonio, dissuaded him from testifying because they are relatives and his testimony will not look “good for the public.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner stresses that the National Bureau of Investigation disregarded the documentary evidence they obtained from the United States and Philippine governments, which would have proven that he was in the United States around the time the crime was committed. The Bureau supposedly obtained US Immigration Naturalization Service and Philippine Bureau of Immigration Certifications showing his departure for the United States on March 9, 1991 and his arrival back to the Philippines on October 27, 1992.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; It also received documentary evidence confirming that petitioner was employed in California in June 1991, and that he purchased a bicycle on June 30, 1991 from Orange Cycle in California.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Moreover, petitioner points out that the National Bureau of Investigation’s Officer-in-Charge Director Federico Opinion (Opinion) admitted that petitioner’s involvement in the murder was a “creation of media”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and that the Bureau has already confirmed through immigration records that petitioner was in the United States during the material dates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioner&nbsp; also&nbsp; argues&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; National&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; of&nbsp; Investigation ignored the evidence showing that the fingerprints found on the fluorescent lamp in the Vizcondes’ garage did not match his fingerprints, but those of Engineer Danilo Aguas, another lead suspect in the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Despite strong contrary evidence, petitioner asserts that the National Bureau of Investigation still pursued the case and falsely implicated him in the crime.&nbsp; The Bureau’s actions, he states, “constitute improper conduct which tends to directly or indirectly impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; and willful disobedience of the order of this Court, for which the officers should be held in contempt of court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioner prays that the following National Bureau of Investigation officers be cited in indirect contempt for the following acts:<br><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><ol><li>Current NBI Director Magtanggol B.

They are punitive in nature, and the Government, the courts, and the people are interested in their prosecution. Their purpose is to preserve the power and vindicate the authority and dignity of the court, and to punish for disobedience of its orders. Strictly speaking, however, they are not criminal proceedings or prosecutions, even though the contemptuous act involved is also a crime. The proceeding has been characterized as sui generis, partaking of some of the elements of both a civil and criminal proceeding, but really constituting neither. In general, criminal contempt proceedings should be conducted in accordance with the principles and rules applicable to criminal cases, in so far as such procedure is consistent with the summary nature of contempt proceedings. So it has been held that the strict rules that govern criminal prosecutions apply to a prosecution for criminal contempt, that the accused is to be afforded many of the protections provided in regular criminal cases, and that proceedings under statutes governing them are to be strictly construed. However, criminal proceedings are not required to take any particular form so long as the substantial rights of the accused are preserved.<br><br>Civil contempt proceedings are generally held to be remedial and civil in their nature; that is, they are proceedings for the enforcement of some duty, and essentially a remedy for coercing a person to do the thing required.&nbsp; As otherwise expressed, a proceeding for civil contempt is one instituted to preserve and enforce the rights of a private party to an action and to compel obedience to a judgment or decree intended to benefit such a party litigant.&nbsp; So a proceeding is one for civil contempt, regardless of its form, if the act charged is wholly the disobedience, by one party to a suit, of a special order made in behalf of the other party and the disobeyed order may still be obeyed, and the purpose of the punishment is to aid in an enforcement of obedience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup>&nbsp; (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote><br>A difference between criminal and civil contempt also lies in the determination of the burden of proof.
