On arraignment, appellant pleaded "not guilty." </p><p> During the trial, AAA, her mother BBB, Dr. Marie Anne Ng-Hua, PO2 Andrew Alcomendas, and social worker Guadalupe Bisenio testified for the prosecution. On the other hand, appellant and his sister CCC testified for the defense.</p><p> <b>The Prosecution's Version</b></p><p> <strong>AAA</strong> testified that appellant was her uncle, brother of her mother BBB. He used to live with them in their residence. On January 13, 2004, around 3 o'clock in the morning, AAA was sleeping beside her three younger brothers when she felt a person on top of her. She realized she had already been undressed and the person on top of her, a man, was making a push and pull movement, his penis inside her vagina. She struggled but the man pinned her down. He continued to ravish her for about two (2) more minutes until she eventually managed to kick him off. He stood up and threatened to kill her parents if she reported the incident. She recognized it was appellant's voice. She was sixteen (16) years old at that time. </p><p> <b>BBB</b> testified that in the morning of January 13, 2004, she turned on the fluorescent light and saw appellant moving her youngest child then sleeping with AAA on the same bed. She asked what he was doing. He said he was just moving the children so they would not fall off the bed. She became suspicious because he was perspiring despite the cold weather.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> She later instructed AAA to come home from school by noontime. When AAA arrived, she asked her what happened earlier. AAA started to cry and admitted she had been raped. They reported the incident to the barangay captain<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> who contacted the police to have the incident blottered. The barangay captain then advised BBB to bring AAA to the hospital for examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> On January 19, 2004, BBB and AAA went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). There, Bisenio prepared a letter-request for AAA's medical examination. They brought the letter to the Bicol Medical Hospital where Dr. Ng-Hua examined AAA and issued a medical certificate with findings of hymenal lacerations at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. They returned to Bisenio for assistance in filing a complaint against appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> The prosecution offered the following documentary exhibits: AAA's birth certificate, Dr. Ng-Hua's medical certificate, letter-request for medical check-up, and AAA's DSWD data record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> <b>The Defense's Evidence</b></p><p> <b>Appellant</b> denied the charge. He testified that in the early morning of January 13, 2004, he woke up to the cries of one of his nephews who was sleeping in the same room shared by other members of the family including himself. He stood up and realized AAA's leg was draped over her younger brother's stomach. It was the reason why his nephew was crying. He then tapped AAA's leg to prompt her to move.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> About the same time, BBB focused light on appellant's designated sleeping area and found it vacant. BBB proceeded to where AAA was sleeping and woke her up. BBB then told AAA to transfer to another room.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p>The following day, village officials came to fetch him at the coprasan of his sibling CCC. They took him to the barangay hall. There, he was informed of the rape charge against him. He denied it, claiming he was falsely charged because of a family dispute concerning a corn plantation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p><b>CCC</b> corroborated appellant's testimony regarding his arrest. She said she was present during the confrontation at the barangay hall.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Trial Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The trial court rendered a verdict of conviction as borne by its Judgment dated January 21, 2013, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, finding accused XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, defined under Article 266-A and penalized under Article 266-B, all of the [Revised Penal Code], said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer a prison term of reclusion perpetua and to pay unto private complainant [xxx] P75,000 as civil indemnity; P75,000 as moral damages and; P30,000 as exemplary damages. </p> <p>SO ORDERED, (words in brackets added)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The trial court gave credence to AAA's factual narration and her positive identification of appellant as the man who sexually ravaged her. It rejected appellant's defense of denial. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Proceedings Before the Court of Appeals</b> </p><p> On appeal, appellant faulted the trial court for rendering a verdict of conviction against him despite the alleged leading questions asked of AAA, her inconsistent answers, and the improbable scenario that her three (3) younger brothers were not roused from sleep while rape was being committed in their presence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), through Assistant Solicitor General Marissa Macaraig-Guillen and State Solicitor Jayrous L. Villanueva defended the verdict of conviction. The OSG maintained that AAA's testimony was firmly corroborated by BBB and Dr. Ng-Hua. The alleged inconsistencies in AAA's testimony did not dwell on the elements of the crime, hence, did not diminish her credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b> </p><p> The Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is DENIED.

On January 13, 2004, around 3 o'clock in the morning, she was roused from sleep by the weight of a man on top of her. She realized she was no longer dressed and the man was making a push and pull movement inside her vagina. She struggled to break free from his clutches but he pinned her down. She eventually managed to kick him off around two (2) minutes later when the push and pull movement had finally stopped. The man threatened to kill her family if she reported the incident. She recognized the man's voice as that of appellant, her uncle. From this testimony, the prosecution positively established that appellant, through force and intimidation, succeeded in having carnal knowledge of AAA against her will. </p> <p> The trial court and the Court of Appeals found AAA persuasive and unwavering in giving her testimony, thus, meriting full weight and credence. Indeed, a young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of the assault on her dignity cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is highly improbable that a girl would fabricate a story that would expose herself and her family to a lifetime of dishonor,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> especially when her charge would mean the long-term imprisonment, if not death, of a blood relative. </p><p> By itself, AAA's testimony withstands scrutiny sufficient to produce a verdict of conviction. But when corroborated by physical evidence, AAA's testimony assumes even more probative weight. Here, Dr. Ng-Hua's medical examination of AAA revealed that the latter sustained hymenal lacerations at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. Hymenal lacerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best evidence of forcible defloration. And when the consistent and forthright testimony of a rape victim is consistent with medical findings, as in this case, the essential requisites of carnal knowledge are deemed to have been sufficiently established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> Appellant, nevertheless, attempts to discredit AAA because (1) the questions propounded on her were allegedly leading and, consequently, inadmissible along with her answers thereto; (2) her purported inconsistent statements render the same incredible; and (3) the presence of her siblings in the same room appellant supposedly raped her would have made the commission of the rape impossible. </p><p> We are not persuaded. </p><p> <b><i>First</i></b>, the alleged leading questions asked of AAA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> do not form part of her direct testimony. Rather, these were asked during the preliminary investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> At any rate, records show that during the trial proceedings, the defense objected only once to the supposed leading questions of t prosecution. The trial court sustained the objection. </p><p> <b><i>Second</i></b>, the alleged inconsistency in AAA's testimony pertaining to whether slip saw appellant sitting on the side of the bed with his clothes on or lying on top of her naked --- is at best misleading. This purported inconsistency does not appear anywhere in the case records. </p><p> In any event, the supposed inconsistency raised refers to a trivial matter and does not affect AAA's credibility. </p><p> <b><i>Third</i></b>, the presence of AAA's three (3) younger siblings in the same room which they shared with other members of the family including AAA and appellant himself obviously did not deter appellant from sexually ravishing his own niece right in the same room. Appellant's depraved behavior proved that lust is not a respecter of people, time, or place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Court has encountered far too many instances where rape was committed in plain view. We even took judicial notice of the fact that among poor couples with big families cramped in small quarters, copulation does not seem to be a problem despite the presence of other persons there.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Rape could be committed under circumstances as indiscreet as a room full of family members sleeping side by side.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> In fine, the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly gave credence to AAA's testimony. Indeed, the trial court's factual findings on the credibility of witnesses are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect. This is because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor, and is in the best position to discern whether they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This rule becomes more compelling when such factual findings carry the full concurrence of the Court of Appeals, as in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> In this light, appellant's defense of denial cannot prevail over AAA's categorical identification of appellant as the one who raped her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Notably, appellant did not even deny his presence in AAA's room and the fact that BBB saw him there moving the other children. His presence in the <i>locus criminis</i> vis-à-vis AAA's testimony that he raped her strongly refutes his theory of denial. All told, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming appellant's conviction for the rape of his sixteen-year (16-year) old niece AAA. </p><p> <b>Penalty</b> </p><p>Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353, prescribes the penalty of<i> reclusion perpetua</i> for simple rape. Where the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim, the proper penalty is death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Here, AAA was sixteen (16) years of age when she got raped. The prosecution offered in evidence her birth certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to prove her minority at the time of the incident. Meanwhile, her blood relation with appellant is undisputed. Appellant took the witness stand and admitted to being AAA's uncle, and brother to BBB.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Consequently, the death penalty should have been imposed were it not for the enactment of RA 9346.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The Court of Appeals therefore correctly sentenced appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> In conformity with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the award of Php75,000,00 civil indemnity, Php75,000.00 moral damages, and Php30,000.00 exemplary damages should be mcreased to Php 100,000.00 each. </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.

HC No. 06066 is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.</b> </p><p> <b>XXX</b> is found <b>GUILTY</b> of <b>Rape</b>, qualified by minority and relationship.
