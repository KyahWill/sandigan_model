CV No. 88099. <p align="center"> <b><i><u>The Facts and Antecedent Proceedings</u></i></b> </p><p> As narrated by the CA, and as culled from the records of the instant case, the essential facts and antecedent proceedings of the case are as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> [Petitioner Ching] and his family own several cinemas in Metro Manila. Sometime in July 1997, [respondent Manas] learned that Ching was going to open four theaters in the Sunshine Mall Plaza in Taguig, Metro Manila. He visited [petitioner] Ching at the latter's office at Spring Cinema, Libertad, Pasay City and introduced himself as a supplier of movie equipments <i>(sic)</i> to Emilio Ching's ([petitioner] Ching's brother) cinemas at Holiday Plaza, Libertad, Pasay City. </p> <p> [Petitioner] Ching informed [respondent] Manas that he needed five complete sets of Simplex Model XL movie projectors for the cinemas at Sunshine Mall. [Respondent] Manas informed [petitioner] Ching that he happened to have Simplex Model XL projectors which are US Rebuilt. He then invited [petitioner] Ching to his house in Makati where said projectors were stored so that the latter could see the same. Since only four Simplex projectors were available then, [respondent] Manas assured [petitioner] Ching that the fifth set of Simplex Model XL will arrive from the United States anytime.</p> <p> On 15 August 1997, [respondent] Manas and [petitioner] Ching executed the Contract of Sale, the pertinent portions of which reads: </p> <blockquote> <p> x x x x</p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify"><em>1.</em></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em><u>OBJECT OF SALE</u> - The SELLER hereby agrees to sell and deliver to the BUYER "FIVE (5) SETS OF SIMPLEX Model XL 35MM MOVIE PROJECTOR and SOUND REPRODUCER, U.S. REBUILT, each set complete with accessories of accurate and exact fittings, the quatity (sic), full descriptions/specifications of the complete items composing each set are as listed in the list hereto attached <u>ANNEX "A"</u> and made as integral part hereof;</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><em>2.</em></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em><u>PURCHASE PRICE AND MANNER OF PAYMENT</u>­ For each complete set, the purchase price shall be SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND PESOS (P630,000.00), Philippine currency, or the total sum of THREE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P3,150,000.00) for the entire five (5) complete sets, which stipulated purchase price shall be paid by the BUYER to the SELLER in the following manner:</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify"><em>(a)</em></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><em>A downpayment of 30% or P945,000.00 upon the signing of this Contract;</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify"><em>(b)</em></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><em>A second payment of 40% or P1,260,000.00 upon full and complete delivery of all the items above-mentioned at the site to be designated by the BUYER provided the complete delivery is effected on or before Jan. 15, 1998; and</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td width="3%"><div align="justify"><em>(c)</em></div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><em>The balance of 30% or P945,000.00 after the complete installation, dry run/testing and satisfactory operations of all the units/sets installed.</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><em>3.</em></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em><u>INSTALLATION</u> - The SELLER shall undertake the complete installation of the apparatus/equipment herein purchased at his own expense provided all the wires and materials to be used in the installation shall be for the account of the BUYER.</em></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><em>4.</em></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em><u>WARRANTY</u> - The SELLER hereby warrants full and satisfactory usefulness of all the apparatus, equipment, parts and accessories for two (2) years counted from the date of their installation.

The four sets of Simplex XL projectors were delivered on 22 August 1997. Several other equipments (sic), parts and accessories for the projector sets were delivered within the period of 22 August 1997 until 8 May 1999.</p> <p> [Petitioner] Ching claims that he asked [respondent] Manas to deliver the fifth Simplex projector set and install the projectors. [Respondent] Manas, not having yet the fifth Simplex XL projector set, prevailed on [petitioner] Ching to receive a Century brand projector. After all, it was intended only to be a standby projector. Because the opening date of his cinemas was fast approaching, [petitioner] Ching agreed. The Century projector, which in the market is a little higher in price than the Simplex brand, was delivered on 29 November 1998.</p> <p> Despite the clarity of paragraph 3 of the contract, the parties differed in the interpretation thereof. Said paragraph reads: </p> <blockquote> <p>x x x x</p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify"><em>3.</em></div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify"><em><u>INSTALLATION</u> - The SELLER shall undertake the complete installation of the apparatus/equipment herein purchased at his own expense provided all the wires and materials to be used in the installation shall be for the account of the BUYER. </em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>x x x x</p> </blockquote> <p> [Respondent] Manas claims to have completed installation of the projectors. On the other hand, [petitioner] Ching asserts that [respondent] Manas failed to completely install the apparatus/equipment prompting him to hire Nelson Ruzgal to do the wiring connections for a fee of P20,000.00.</p> <p> Ruzgal commenced his work on the wirings to make the apparatus/equipments (<em>sic</em>) work on 26 November 1998. He was assisted by the two projectionists of [petitioner] Ching, Adan Mostera and Lito Pilar. Two days before the scheduled opening of the cinemas, on 23 December 1998, Ruzgal and the projectionists could not light the lamphouses. [Respondent] Manas, who had been observing them, called in his own technician to help. Since the lamphouse would not light, [respondent] Manas' technician took some parts from the rectifier. After re-installing said parts, the lamphouse lit up. Having observed how [respondent] Manas' technician focused the lamphouses and lit the xenon bulb, Ruzgal and [petitioner] Ching's two projectionists, went to the other theaters to adjust the lamphouses. Since the adjusting mechanism was found inside the lamphouse and the bulb inside emitted heat, it took them almost an hour to adjust one lamphouse. It took Ruzgal and the projectionists overnight to finish adjusting all ten lamphouses. </p> <p> On 24 December 1998, the trial run of the cinemas was successfully held and the cinemas officially opened on 25 December 1998. </p> <p> In the first four months after operations, some parts of the projectors started having problems. [Respondent] Manas was informed of the defects and asked to replace the same but he failed to do so. The defective equipments (<em>sic</em>) and their defects are as follows: </p> <ol><li> Two pieces optical lens malfunctioned, first, in February 1999 and another in March 1999. Because [respondent] Manas did not replace the same, [petitioner] Ching bought the parts at Star Theater Supply, Inc. <br><br></li><li>Ten pieces lamphouses and one reflector. In March to April 1999, the lamphouses misaligned. In an attempt to fix the same, one of [petitioner] Ching's projectionists, opened the lamphouse and ended up breaking the reflector inside. Since [respondent] Manas did not repair or replace the same and no spare parts were readily available in the market, [petitioner] Ching contracted Rodegelio Anday to fabricate lamphouses for him for the contract price of P555,000.00.<br><br></li><li> Ten pieces rectifiers. In April 1999, the rectifiers also malfunctioned due to electrical fluctuations. <br><br></li><li> One piece projector motor. In late 1999 to early 2000, the projector motor which drives the projector to run and play the movies, did not work To avoid stoppage in the operations of his cinemas, [petitioner] Ching utilized available spare parts from the other cinemas he owned. </li></ol> <p> Sometime in May 1999, [respondent] Manas wrote [petitioner] Ching a notice of full compliance of the terms of the contract of sale. He also asked Lito Pilar, one of [petitioner] Ching's projectionists to affix his signature thereon. It reads thus:</p> <blockquote> <p class="style1"> Sir: </p> <p><em> FULLY COMPLETED AND COMPLIED with the terms of the CONTRACT OF SALE -10 units XL projection film systems of Cinemas 1, 2, 3, 4 - Sunshine Cinema Mall, FTC Complex</em>. </p> <table width="100%" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="36%"><em><b>LOCATORS</b></em></td> <td width="16%"><div align="center"><em>1</em></div></td> <td width="16%"><div align="center"><em>2</em></div></td> <td width="16%"><div align="center"><em>3</em></div></td> <td width="16%"><div align="center"><em>4</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Projector Heads</em></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Soundheads/Motors</em></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Xenon Lamphouses</em></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Rectifiers</em></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>Lenses, Flat/Mascope</em></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>BOOTH ACCESSORIES</em></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> <td><div align="center"><em>Ok</em></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center"> <table width="80%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><em>Projectionist</em></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><em>Adan Mostera</em></div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><em>Lito Pilar </em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>	 <em>Kindly inspect the whole projection systems of Cinemas 1, 2, 3,

Respondent Manas is not entitled to an award of stipulated interest. </p><p> To recall, the RTC, in its Decision dated September 4, 2006, ruled that stipulated interest of 12% should be awarded in favor of respondent Manas, counted from the date of default. The CA modified the same and held that the interest of 12% <em>per annum</em> stipulated by the parties in the Contract of Sale should be applied from the finality of judgment until full payment. In the Amended Decision, the CA further modified the RTC's Decision and held that the 12% stipulated interest should be counted from the date of extrajudicial demand on August 24, 1999 until full payment. </p><p> Based on the established facts of the instant case, however, both the RTC and CA committed error in awarding contractual stipulated interest in favor of respondent Manas. </p><p> The contractual stipulated interest is provided in paragraph 6 of the Contract of Sale, which states that <u>in the event of failure by petitioner Ching to pay any installment of the herein agreed purchase price<em> when such is already due</em></u>, the latter shall be liable to pay an interest on the amount due at the rate of <u>14% percent<em> per annum</em> (and not 12% <em>per annum </em>as incorrectly held by the RTC and CA)</u>: </p><blockquote> <p><em> 6. <u>NON-PERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATION</u> - In the event of failure by the SELLER to deliver and install the apparatus/equipment herein purchased, the BUYER shall have the option of rescinding this Contract with damages or institute a legal action for specific performance with damages. On the other hand, in the event (sic) failure by the BUYER to pay any installment of the herein agreed purchase price when such is already due, the BUYER shall be liable to pay an interest on the amount due at the rate of fourteen (14%) percent per annum. </em></p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, as agreed upon by the parties in the Contract of Sale, the stipulated interest to be paid by petitioner Ching <u>shall only accrue when the installment payment is<em> already due</em> and petitioner Ching failed to make such installment payment</u>. Simply stated, petitioner Ching shall pay the stipulated interest only when he is in <b>delay</b>. </p><p> Based on the established facts of the instant case, petitioner Ching was <b><i>not in delay</i></b> when he failed to pay the balance of the purchase price. </p><p> To recall, based on paragraph 2 of the Contract of Sale, petitioner Ching obligated himself to make three installment payments as regards the objects of the sale: (a) the down payment of 30% or P945,000.00 upon the signing of the Contract of Sale, which petitioner Ching did; (b) a second payment of 40% or P1,260,000.00 <i><u>upon full and complete delivery of all the items indicated in the Contract of Sale, provided the complete delivery is effected on or before January 15, 1998; and (c) the balance of 30% or P945,000.00 after the complete installation, dry run/testing and satisfactory operations of all the units/sets installed</u></i>. </p><p> Stated simply, the Contract of Sale between petitioner Ching, as buyer, and respondent Manas, as seller, gave rise to a <b>reciprocal obligation</b>, wherein petitioner Ching was obliged to pay the balance of the purchase price while respondent Manas was obliged to make complete delivery of the objects of the sale on or before January 15, 1998 and ensure complete installation, dry run-testing, and satisfactory operations of all the equipment installed. </p><p> In a reciprocal obligation, the performance of one is conditioned on the simultaneous fulfillment of the other obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Neither party incurs in delay if the other does not comply or is not ready to comply in a manner with what is incumbent upon him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> As explained by recognized Civil Law Commentator, former CA Justice Eduardo P. Caguioa, a reciprocal obligation has been defined as that "where each of the parties is a promissee of a prestation and promises another in return as a counterpart of equivalent of the other. x x x The most salient feature of this obligation is reciprocity." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> In the instant case, it is not of serious dispute that respondent Manas reneged on his obligations as seller, justifying petitioner Ching's refusal to pay the balance of the purchase price.</p><p> <i>First</i>, in its Amended Decision, the CA already found as established fact that there was no complete delivery of the objects of sale in accordance with the Contract of Sale.</p><p> It was the obligation of respondent Manas to deliver five sets of Simplex Model XL 35mm movie projectors. Respondent Manas was only able to deliver four sets, and the fifth set delivered was a Century brand projector. As held by the CA in its Amended Decision, the delivery of the Century brand projector cannot be considered a substantial compliance of the obligation to deliver a Simplex Model XL movie projector because the Century brand projector is significantly less valuable compared to a Simplex Model XL movie projector. As found by the CA, the Century brand projector is worth only P220,000.00, while a Simplex Model XL projector costs P630,000.00, or almost three times the value of the Century brand projector.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> The CA likewise noted that petitioner Ching "did not acquiesce [to] the delivery of the Century brand as a substitute of the Simplex model. [Petitioner Ching] had to accept the Century brand delivered on November 29, 1998 considering that he had already announce (sic) to the public that the theater will start its operation on December 25, 1998 x x x. Hence, he was forced to accept the Century brand in time for the opening of the movie house."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> The CA pointed out that the evidence on record reveals that when petitioner Ching reminded respondent Manas that he would pay respondent Manas the complete balance of the contract price only after the complete delivery of the five sets of the Simplex Model XL movie projectors, respondent Manas responded positively as the fifth set of the Simplex Model XL movie projector would supposedly be forthcoming.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The records also show that the fifth Simplex Model XL movie projector was never delivered to petitioner Ching. </p><p> <i>Second</i>, as factually found by the CA, "the delivery was made <u>after 15 January 1998</u>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in contravention of respondent Manas' obligation to deliver the objects of the sale on or before January 15, 1998. </p><p> <i>Third</i>, there was no complete installation of the movie projector units as contemplated under the Contract of Sale. </p><p> The CA factually found that "[respondent] Manas is liable to [petitioner] Ching for failing to comply with his obligation to completely install the equipments (<em>sic</em>) which resulted to [petitioner] Ching's expenses in hiring a third party to completely install the projectors."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It must be recalled that petitioner Ching was obligated to pay the balance of 30% or P945,000.00 only after the complete installation, dry run/testing and satisfactory operations of all the units/sets installed. As stressed by the CA, "[t]he stipulation in the contract of sale is clear and unambiguous. The <b>complete</b> installation is to be made by the seller."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> The "complete installation" contemplated under the Contract of Sale refers to the installation of <u>five complete sets of Simplex Model XL movie projectors</u>. However, as already discussed, the fifth Simplex Model XL movie projector was not delivered and installed, despite respondent Manas promising petitioner Ching that the said unit "was coming anytime soon."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Hence, even as petitioner Ching engaged the services of a third party to complete the installation of the projectors delivered, there was still no complete installation envisioned under the contract because the fifth Simplex Model XL unit was never delivered and installed. </p><p> Furthermore, the Court notes that in the May 1999 letter issued by respondent Manas addressed to petitioner Ching, it is apparent that respondent Manas sought the payment of the remaining balance of 70% of the contract price only after petitioner Ching would have inspected the entire projection system and found them to be satisfactory: </p><blockquote> <p> <em>Kindly inspect the whole projection systems of Cinemas 1, 2, 3, 4 and should you find them to your fullest satisfaction, please release the remaining balance (70%) of the Contract of Sale be paid and release (sic) to the undersigned</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Simply stated, respondent Manas covenanted that the payment of the remaining balance by petitioner Ching was made contingent on the latter's satisfactory assessment that respondent Manas completely delivered and installed all of the movie projector units. Obviously, petitioner Ching did not find the delivery, installation, and operation of the movie projector systems satisfactory on account of respondent Manas' failure to deliver the fifth Simplex XL movie projector, the failure of respondent Manas to ensure the complete installation of the movie projector systems, and respondent Manas' delivery of defective components. </p><p> In fact, very telling is the unequivocal pronouncement of the CA that "<b><i><u>[petitioner] Ching had a valid reason for refusing payment</u></i></b> until the issue of recoupement (sic) for breach of warranty was resolved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> Therefore, with petitioner Ching being justified in withholding the payment of the balance of the purchase price on account of the several breaches of contract committed by respondent Manas,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> it cannot be said that petitioner Ching was in delay. Necessarily, respondent Manas is not entitled to the stipulated interest as provided in the Contract of Sale. And considering that petitioner Ching cannot be deemed in delay in accordance with the Contract of Sale, the legal interest shall accrue only from the finality of this Decision until full payment. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
