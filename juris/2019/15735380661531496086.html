				<BR><BR><div align="justify"> <p></p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Case</u></b> </p><p> This administrative matter involves the legality of the Contracts of Services between the Court and Ms. Helen P. Macasaet (Ms. Macasaet) for her rendition of consultancy services for the Enterprise Information Systems Plan (EISP) for the years 2010-2014. </p><p align="center"> <u><b>The Facts</b></u> </p><p> The EISP is intended to serve as the framework of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) initiatives of the Judiciary. INDRA Sistemas S.A. (INDRA) was designated to provide Management and Consultancy Services for the development of the Judiciary's ICT Capability as part of the Judicial Reform Support Project financed by the World Bank. In the 23 June 2009 Resolution in A.M. No. 08-11 -09-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court approved the EISP submitted by INDRA. However, the 2009 Budget did not include a budget for the judiciary-wide technical infrastructure, nationwide connectivity, and network security, which are prerequisites to the nationwide implementation of the EISP and on-going ICT projects like the eCourts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Thus, there was a need to hire the services of an ICT consultant to review the status of the implementation of the EISP and related ICT and computerization projects. </p><p> In its 10 September 2013 Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Bids and Awards Committee for Consultancy Services (BAC-CS) considered the procurement <b>as highly technical in nature</b> and primarily requires trust and confidence owing to the fact that the EISP is a priority program of the Court. In the same Memorandum, the BAC-CS recommended three (3) consultants who may be considered by the Supreme Court for the procurement of consultancy services. In a Joint Memorandum dated 12 September 2013<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to then Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno, Atty. Michael B. Ocampo (Atty. Ocampo) of the Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ) and Mr. Edilberto A. Davis (Mr. Davis), then the Acting Chief of the Management Information Systems Office (MISO), stated that after reviewing and evaluating the three proposed consultants by the BAC-CS, they found Ms. Macasaet to be the most qualified. Their recommendation that Ms. Macasaet be hired for the procurement was approved by the then Chief Justice. The Supreme Court, ostensibly represented by its then Chief Administrative Officer Atty. Eden T. Candelaria (Atty. Candelaria), entered into a six-month Contract of Services with Ms. Macasaet on 1 October 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The consultancy fee of Ms. Macasaet under the Contract of Services dated 1 October 2013 was P600,000.00, to be paid in six (6) equal monthly installments.</p><p> In a Memorandum to the Chief Justice dated 16 April 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Atty. Ocampo stated that there was a need for a technical and policy consultant for the implementation of the Updated EISP Work Plan. Atty. Ocampo proposed to directly negotiate a six-month contract with the consultant, who would be paid a fee of P250,000.00 a month, inclusive of all applicable taxes. Atty. Ocampo based his proposal on Section 53.7 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> where a procuring entity can forego public bidding and directly negotiate a six-month contract with a consultant, who will perform work that is highly technical, proprietary, primarily confidential or policy determining. Atty. Ocampo stated that the proposed consultancy is clearly <b>highly technical</b> and policy determining, which would be subject to the confirmation of the BAC-CS.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Again, in its 15 May 2014 Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the BAC-CS reiterated that the subject procurement can proceed without the Committee's involvement as it was "<b>highly technical in nature</b> and primarily requires trust and confidence, owing to the fact that it is a priority program of the Supreme Court." The BAC-CS stated, in the same Memorandum, that in addition to the consultant previously engaged, the other consultants named in their previous memorandum should also be considered for the procurement of the consultancy services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Acting on the Memorandum of the BAC-CS, Atty. Ocampo and Mr. Davis determined, in their Joint Memorandum dated 20 May 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> that Ms. Macasaet was the most qualified among the three proposed consultants. This Joint Memorandum was approved by then Chief Justice Sereno. </p><p> However, the records are bereft of any explanation as to how the three (3) consultants were chosen by the BAC-CS for the purpose of recommending to the Supreme Court the procurement of consultancy services. As aptly pointed out by the report of the Office of the Chief Attorney (OCAt) dated 6 November 2017 (OCAt Report): </p><blockquote> <p> There are no documents from the BAC-CS that would show the following: (i) posting of opportunity in PhilGEPS website, SC website and SC bulletin boards or letter/s addressed to prospective individual consultant/s to submit his/her/their resume with respective financial proposal/s; (ii) that any or all three (3) prospective individual consultants named by the BAC-CS submitted his/her/their resume with respective financial proposal/s to the BAC-CS; (iii) the conduct of the negotiation; [iv] resolution recommending the award; [v] notice of award; [vi] proof that the notice of award was posted in the PhilGEPS website, SC website and in the SC bulletin boards; and [vii] notice to proceed. </p> <p> If at all, the BAC-CS terminated its role after having "resolved to consider the subject procurement as <b>highly technical in nature</b> and primarily requires trust and confidence owing to the fact that it is the priority program of the Supreme Court." After holding "that there is no need for said procurement to pass through the regular process of engaging consultants being conducted by it", the procurement got off the hands of the BAC-CS through a disposition "that the Supreme Court, through the Office of the Chief Justice, can and should exercise its discretion to act on the subject procurement so as not to delay the same." The BAC-CS, instead of proceeding as prescribed, merely submitted three (3) names of "consultants which can be considered by the Supreme Court for the subject procurement." Even the process through which the BAC-CS had this list of three (3) names, which includes Ms. Macasaet, is not on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> On 23 May 2014, the Court, ostensibly represented by Atty. Candelaria as Chief Administrative Officer, entered into a second six-month Contract of Services with Ms. Macasaet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> In the meantime, the Court issued an <i>En Banc</i> Resolution dated 16 September 2014<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> in A.M. No. 14-09-06-SC, approving the updated EISP work and its budget (2014-2019), which were supposedly the output of the 1 October 2013 Contract of Services with Ms. Macasaet. </p><p> In the Joint Memorandum dated 1 December 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Mr. Davis and Atty. Ocampo stated that there was a continuing need for the services of a consultant to provide <b>technical advice</b> and assistance in the first year implementation of the plan and in developing ICT policies to support it. Thus, they recommended the extension of Ms. Macasaet's contract for another six (6) months.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Then Chief Justice Sereno approved the Joint Memorandum, and a Contract of Services was entered into on 10 December 2014<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> between Ms. Macasaet and the Court, where Atty. Candelaria signed for and in behalf of the Court. Thereafter, the Contract of Services was extended five more times, for a total of six extensions of six months for every extension. In total, the Court entered into a Contract of Services with Ms. Macasaet for a total of eight times. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Issue</u></b> </p><p> The issue at hand is the legality of the eight Contracts of Services, entered into by the Court by negotiated procurement, ostensibly represented by Atty. Candelaria, with Ms. Macasaet. This issue was initially part of A.M. No. 17-08-05-SC entitled "Re: Letter-Request of Atty. Lorenzo G. Gadon for Certified True Copies of Certain Documents in Connection with the Filing of an Impeachment Complaint." </p><p> In a Resolution dated 19 September 2017,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the question of the legality of the Contracts of Services was referred to the OCAt and former Chief Justice Sereno was given the opportunity to comment on Atty. Gadon's request for documents in relation to the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet. In compliance with the Court's Resolution dated 19 September 2017,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the OCAt submitted the OCAt Report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Acting on the OCAt Report, then Chief Justice Sereno submitted her Preliminary Comment on 20 November 2017 to the other members of the Court <i>En Banc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The Court, in its Resolution dated 21 November 2017,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> required the BAC-CS and Ms. Macasaet to comment. The BAC-CS and Ms. Macasaet filed their respective Comments on 25 January 2018<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and 22 January 2018.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The Court noted the Comment of Ms. Macasaet in its Resolution dated 23 January 2018.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In its Resolution dated 30 January 2018,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court noted the Comment of the BAC-CS. In the same Resolution, Attys. Candelaria and Ocampo were required by the Court to comment on the OCAt Report, which comment they filed on 20 February 2018 and 25 April 2018, respectively. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b> </p><p> Based on the facts and applicable laws and regulations, all the Contracts of Services should be declared void <i>ab initio</i>. </p><p> <b>SIGNATORY HAD NO WRITTEN AUTHORITY</b></p><p> The signatory in all the eight (8) Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet was Atty. Candelaria in her capacity as Chief Administrative Officer and Deputy Clerk of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <b>However, the records fail to show that she was authorized in writing by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> to act as signatory of the Court in entering into these Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet.</b> In fact, in her Comment dated 20 February 2018,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Atty. Candelaria herself <b>admitted</b> that she was not <b>given any express full written authority</b> by then Chief Justice Sereno to sign the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet. In her Comment, Atty. Candelaria states: </p><blockquote> <p> In these particular Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet, since the Chief Justice as the Head of the Procuring Entity has already approved the award of the contract to the consultant and that the contract was already prepared by the Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ) indicating therein the Deputy Clerk of Court and Chief Administrative Officer as the Court's representative,<b> it was understood as <i>an implied authority</i> and designation for the undersigned to act as signatory for and in behalf of the Court.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Boldfacing and italicization supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Atty. Candelaria stated that since the then Chief Justice had already approved the contract with Ms. Macasaet and the Office of the Chief Justice had already prepared the contract, she took it as an "<b>implied authority</b>" to sign on behalf of the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Even assuming for the sake of argument that there was an "implied authority," as in fact nothing of such authority can be implied from the contract, an "implied authority" is not the "<b>full authority</b>" in writing required under Sections 4 and 5 of Executive Order (EO) No. 423. </p><p> EO No. 423 dated 20 April 2005<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> prescribed the rules and procedures on the review and approval of all government contracts to conform with the Government Procurement Reform Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> EO No. 423 was issued in accordance with Section 75 of the Government Procurement Reform Act, which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 75.<em> Implementing Rules and Regulations and Standard Forms</em>. — Within sixty (60) days from the promulgation of this Act, the necessary rules and regulations for the proper implementation of its provisions shall be formulated by the GPPB, jointly with the members of the Oversight Committee created under Section 74 hereof. The said rules and regulations shall be approved by the President of the Philippines. For a period not later than thirty (30) days upon the approval of the implementing rules and regulations, the standard forms for Procurement shall be formulated and approved. </p> </blockquote> <p> Specifically, Sections 4 and 5 of EO No. 423 provide: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 4. Approval of Government Contract Entered Into Through Alternative Methods of Procurement. -</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> b. For Government Contracts Involving An Amount Below Five Hundred Million Pesos (P500 Million). — Except for Government contracts required by law to be acted upon and/or approved by the President, <b>the Heads of the Procuring Entities shall likewise have full authority to give final approval and/or to enter into Government contracts of their respective agencies, entered into through alternative methods of procurement allowed by law.</b> Provided, that the Department Secretary certifies under oath that the contract has been entered into in faithful compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. </p> <p> <b>The Heads of the Procuring Entities may delegate in writing this <i>full authority</i> to give final approval and/or to enter into Government contracts involving an amount below Five Hundred Million Pesos (P500 Million) entered into through alternative methods of procurement allowed by law, as circumstances may warrant</b> (i.e., decentralization of procurement in a Government Agency), subject to existing laws and such limitations imposed by the Head of the Procuring Entity concerned (Section 5(j), Republic Act No. 9184). </p> <p> Section 5. Authority to Bind the Government. — <b>All Government contracts shall require the approval and signature of the respective Heads of the Procuring Entities or their respective duly authorized officials, as the case may be, as required by law, applicable rules and regulations, and by this Executive Order, before said Government contracts shall be considered approved in accordance with law and binding on the government, except as may be otherwise provided in Republic Act No. 9184. </b>For Government contracts required by law to be acted upon and/or approved by the President, Section 6 of this Executive Order governs the process by which such Government contracts shall be considered entered into with authority and binding on the Government. </p> <p> The Heads of the Procuring Entities or their respective duly authorized officials, as the case may be, shall be responsible and accountable for ensuring that all Government contracts they approve and/or enter into are in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations and are consistent with the spending and development priorities of Government. </p> <p> <b>All Government contracts entered into in violation of the provisions of law, rules and regulations, and of this Executive Order shall be considered contracts entered into without authority and are thus invalid and not binding on the Government.</b> (Boldfacing and italicization supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> From the foregoing, it is clear that it is the Head of the Procuring Entity who is authorized to enter into binding government contracts, <b>when such contracts are entered into through alternative methods of procurement such as directly negotiated contracts like the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet. </b>This authority may be delegated, but this must be done only "<b>in writing</b>" with "<b>full authority</b>" to give "final approval and/or to enter into" the contract delegated to such duly authorized official. <b>Since the alternative method of procurement is an exception to the general rule that procurement shall be through public bidding, the written "full authority" cannot be general, but must refer specifically to the particular contract being entered into through the alternative method of procurement. </b></p><p> The Head of the Procuring Entity is defined by the IRR of the Government Procurement Reform Act as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. Definition of Terms</p> <p> x x x x</p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%">t)</td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify"><i>Head of the Procuring Entity (HoPE)</i>.

The Head of the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>. Thus, any government contract below P500 Million entered into by the Supreme Court through alternative methods of procurement should be approved by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> as Head of the Procuring Entity. </p> <p> Article VIII, Section 6 of the Constitution provides that the Supreme Court "<b>shall have administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof</b>." Thus, the administrative powers of the Court - which include entering into government contracts in the exercise of these powers of administration - are vested in the members of the Supreme Court sitting <i>en banc</i>, as a collegial body. To repeat, any government contract entered into on and in behalf of the Supreme Court must be authorized by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>. </p><p> The powers of the Supreme Court - whether judicial or administrative supervision - are exercised by the members of the Court sitting en banc or by the members sitting in their respective Divisions. Rule 2, Section 1 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 1. <i>Exercise of judicial and administrative functions</i>. — <b>The Court exercises its judicial functions and its powers of administrative supervision over all courts and their personnel through the Court <i>en banc</i> or its Divisions.</b> It administers its activities under the leadership of the Chief Justice, who may, for this purpose, constitute supervisory or special committees headed by individual Members of the Court or working committees of court officials and personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Supreme Court is first and foremost a collegial body, with one vote for each Justice, including the Chief Justice, in all judicial or administrative matters for decision. The Supreme Court exercises its functions through the Court <i>En Banc</i> or its Divisions. As the Court is a collegial body, absent a proper authorization by the Court <i>En Banc</i>, even the Chief Justice who is <i>primus inter pares</i> cannot act on his or her own. This Court has previously emphasized the collegial nature of the Supreme Court, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> To reiterate, the Court, whether sitting <i>En Banc</i> or in Division, acts as a collegial body. By virtue of the collegiality, the Chief Justice alone cannot promulgate or issue any decisions or orders. In <i>Complaint of Mr. Aurelio Indencia Arrienda Against SC Justices Puno, Kapunan, Pardo, Ynares-Santiago</i>, the Court has elucidated on the collegial nature of the Court in relation to the role of the Chief Justice, viz.: </p> <blockquote> <p> The complainant's vituperation against the Chief Justice on account of what he perceived was the latter's refusal "to take a direct positive and favorable action" on his letters of appeal overstepped the limits of proper conduct. It betrayed his lack of understanding of a fundamental principle in our system of laws. Although the Chief Justice is <i>primus inter pares</i>, he cannot legally decide a case on his own because of the Court's nature as a collegial body. Neither can the Chief Justice, by himself, overturn the decision of the Court, whether of a division or the <i>en banc</i>. </p> <p> There is only one Supreme Court from whose decisions all other courts are required to take their bearings. While most of the Court's work is performed by its three divisions, the Court remains one court - single, unitary, complete and supreme. Flowing from this is the fact that, while individual justices may dissent or only partially concur, when the Court states what the law is, it speaks with only one voice. Any doctrine or principle of law laid down by the court may be modified or reversed only by the Court <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> While the powers are vested in the Supreme Court as a collegial body, such powers may be delegated by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>. In A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> delegated some of its administrative functions to the Divisions of the Court, the Chief Justice, and the Chairpersons of the Divisions. The delegation of these administrative powers over all courts and its personnel was done through a resolution issued by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> because the power of administrative supervision is vested in the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> as a collegial body. </p><p> In particular, A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised) authorized the Divisions, the Chief Justice, and the Chairpersons of the Divisions, to act on certain administrative matters to relieve the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> from additional burden brought about by the considerable number of administrative matters or judicial cases. Specifically, the Chief Justice was authorized to act or resolve the following matters: </p><blockquote> <p> III. To <b>REFER</b> to the Chief Justice for appropriate action or resolution, <b>for and in behalf of the Court <i>En Banc</i></b>, administrative matters relating to, or in connection with, </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="center">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Recommendations for the detail of personnel from one office, division, or section in the Supreme Court and the Office of the Court Administrator to another office, division, or section;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Rendition of overtime services and fixing of overtime compensation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Purchase of supplies, furniture, vehicles, and equipment, including computers and their accessories or paraphernalias; and approval or disapproval of claims for payment therefor; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Awards of contracts for the supply of services, such as security, janitorial, photocopying services, operation of the canteen, and other allied or incidental services;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(e)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Approval of requests for payment of electric, telephone and water bills, and bills for the services mentioned in the immediately preceding item;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(f)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Requests for the repair of Halls of Justice and approval of claims for payment therefor;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(g)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Disposal of old records and unserviceable vehicles, equipment, computers, and the like;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(h)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Domestic travel of officials and personnel of the Judiciary; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">(i)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Such other matters where the decision, action, or resolution thereon or approval thereof is vested in the Chief Justice by the Constitution, by law, by the Court <i>En Banc</i>, by resolutions of the Constitutional Fiscal Autonomy Group (CFAG), or by this revised Resolution, such as, the augmentation of items in the budget from savings in other items thereof, realignment of the budget allocation of the continuing appropriation of the Court (the Fiscal Autonomy Account), or the administration of the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), or those which are traditionally vested in the Chief Justice as head of the Judiciary. (Emphasis supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Similarly, in A.M. No. 10-1-10-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> authorized the Clerk of Court <i>En Banc</i>, the Court Administrator, the Chief Justice, the Chairpersons of the Divisions to approve certain procurement requests, subject to certain threshold amounts. A.M. No. 10-1-10-SC also stated which <b>procurement requests</b> must be approved by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>. A.M. No. 10-1-10-SC issued by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> reads in part: </p> <p> The Court [r]esolved, upon the recommendation of the Procurement Planning Committee (PPC), to </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (d) AUTHORIZE the PPC to indorse to the appropriate Property Division the procurement of items or projects, subject to approval as follows: </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(i)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">For procurement requests with a total cost of up to One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) - for the Supreme Court, approval of the Clerk of Court <i>En Banc</i>, or in his/her absence, the Deputy Clerk of Court, and for the Lower Courts, the Court Administrator;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(ii)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">For procurement requests with a total cost of more than One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) up to Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) - the Chief Justice (exclusive of vehicles); </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(iii)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">For procurement requests with a total cost of more than Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) up to Four Million Pesos (P4,000,000.00) - the three (3) Chairpersons of the Divisions (exclusive of vehicles); and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(iv)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">For procurement requests with a total cost of above Four Million Pesos (P4,000,000.00) - the Court <i>En Banc</i> inclusive of procurement of motor vehicles; </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Thus, while the Chief Justice may approve <b>procurement requests</b> if it meets the threshold amount approved by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> through its resolution, this authority to approve is still delegated by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> and is not inherent in the position of Chief Justice. To repeat, even the authority to approve procurement requests is delegated by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>. Without such delegated authority from the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>, the Chief Justice simply cannot approve any <b>procurement requests</b> on behalf of the Supreme Court. <b>It is with more reason that the Chief Justice cannot approve <i>procurement contracts</i>, as distinguished from <i>procurement requests</i>, without the delegated authority from the Supreme Court <i>En Banc.</i> </b></p> <p> Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the Chief Justice is not authorized by the Court <i>En Banc</i> to independently act on behalf of the Supreme Court to enter into government contracts that are highly technical, proprietary, primarily confidential or policy determining such as the subject Contracts of Services. The power to enter into such contracts was clearly not delegated by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> to the Chief Justice. Thus, the Contracts of Services should have been authorized by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> which has administrative power over all courts and personnel thereof, and not merely by the then Chief Justice. <b>A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised) expressly provides that those administrative matters not referred in the said resolution shall be acted upon by the Court <i>En Banc</i>,</b> to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> All other administrative matters or cases which are either expressly declared above to be cognizable by the Court <i>En Banc</i> <b>or are not covered by the foregoing referrals shall be acted upon or resolved by the Court <i>En Banc</i>.</b> The Chief Justice may likewise refer to the Court En Banc for its action or resolution any other matter which, in his opinion, should be resolved by it. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, it is important to note that the full written authority to approve or sign to be given to the authorized official by the Head of the Procuring Entity should refer to a specific government contract to be entered into by the Procuring Entity through an alternative method of procurement. </p><p> A general authority to sign contracts on behalf of a government entity is insufficient for the official to sign a government contract entered into through any of the alternative methods of procurement. A government contract procured through any of the alternative methods of procurement is an exceptional method of entering into government contracts because the policy of the government is to conduct public bidding in all procurements in order to extend equal opportunity to all eligible and qualified private parties to participate in government procurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Thus, the alternative methods of procurement such as negotiated contracts are an exception to the general practice of procurement of government contracts which generally involves public bidding. As such, the law explicitly requires the Head of the Procuring Entity to be responsible for such government contract. Section 5 of EO No. 423 provides: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. Authority to Bind the Government. — x x x x</p> <p> The Heads of the Procuring Entities or their respective duly authorized officials, as the case may be, shall be <b>responsible and accountable for ensuring that all Government contracts they approve and/or enter into</b> are in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations and are consistent with the spending and development priorities of Government. </p> <p> x x x x (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, the law requires that it should be the Head of the Procuring Entity who approves or signs the government contract or in the alternative, an official who is duly authorized by the Head of the Procuring Entity through a written delegation of full authority to enter into the government contract. The requirement of a written authority is to ensure that the Head of the Procuring Entity or his or her respective duly authorized representative is responsible and accountable for the government contracts entered into on behalf of the Procuring Entity, and prevent unauthorized officials from signing and approving contracts. In this case, however, the written authority delegated to Atty. Candelaria, the alleged authorized official, is <b>non-existent</b>. </p><p> Atty. Candelaria alleges in her Comment that her authority to enter into the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet on behalf of this Court was the Joint Memorandum recommending Ms. Macasaet to be hired as ICT consultant and that steps be undertaken to execute a contract for consultancy services between the Court and Ms. Macasaet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This is not the written "full authority" required by EO No. 423. </p><p> As expressly stated in Section 4 of EO No. 423, "<b>full authority</b>" must be delegated in writing to the authorized official by the Head of the Procuring Entity. <b>Being a special authority availed as an exception to the general rule on public bidding, the written "full authority" must refer specifically to the particular contract that is being entered into through the alternative method of procurement.</b> The Joint Memorandum dated 20 May 2014 prepared for then Chief Justice Sereno and signed by Atty. Ocampo and Mr. Davis cannot be considered as a delegation by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> of full authority to Atty. Candelaria to act and sign on behalf of the Supreme Court. The Joint Memorandum was not even addressed to the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> - it was prepared only for then Chief Justice Sereno. Thus, the other members of the Supreme Court were not informed of the subject Contracts of Services. The Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> was notified of the existence of the Contracts of Services only upon the filing of the letter-request of Atty. Gadon. Since the other members of the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> were clearly unaware of the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet, it is obvious that the power to enter into such contracts was not delegated to anyone. <b>The Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> could not have delegated the power to enter into such contracts which it did not know even existed.</b> </p><p> While then Chief Justice Sereno signed the Joint Memorandum dated 20 May 2014 to signify her approval to the Joint Memorandum prepared by Atty. Ocampo and Mr. Davis, it does not vest any authority on Atty. Candelaria to sign the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet. <b>To repeat, then Chief Justice Sereno had no authority to delegate the power to enter into the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet. Such power is vested only with the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> and not with the Chief Justice.</b> Likewise, under Section 4 of EO No. 423, only the Head of the Procuring Entity may delegate in writing the full authority to give approval and/or enter into government contracts. Thus, the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>, as Head of the Procuring Entity, exercises the power to delegate the signing of government contracts entered into through alternative methods of procurement as allowed by law. The delegated official could have been the Chief Justice, another member or members of the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>, or any other official of the Court. However, in this case, it is clear that the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> did not delegate such power to anyone because it was not informed of the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet. </p><p> Moreover, even assuming that the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> had delegated to the then Chief Justice the power to enter into the Contracts of Services, then Chief Justice Sereno could no longer re-delegate such power to another official. It is well-settled that what has been delegated can no longer be further delegated or re-delegated by the original delegate to another - <i>Delegata potestas non potest delegari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The power of administrative supervision over all courts and its personnel is vested by the Constitution in the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>. It is the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> which exercises administrative power over the courts and personnel, which includes the authority to enter into government contracts through alternative methods of procurement allowed by law. While the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> may delegate its administrative powers to another such as its Divisions, the Chairpersons of the Divisions or the Chief Justice - as it has done in A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised) - the delegates may no longer re-delegate the authority or power delegated to them. Therefore, even assuming that the Supreme Court En Banc delegated to the then Chief Justice the power to enter into the government contracts with Ms. Macasaet, then Chief Justice Sereno could no longer re-delegate such authority. </p><p>Even assuming for the sake of argument, although incorrectly, that then Chief Justice Sereno had the authority to delegate the power to enter into the Contracts of Services, Atty. Candelaria still failed to show any written authority from the then Chief Justice authorizing her to enter into the said Contracts of Services. Atty. Candelaria attached several Memoranda where authority was given to her to sign for and in behalf of <b><i>previous</i></b> Chief Justices. This is not the full written delegation of authority required by Section 4 of EO No. 423. Evidently, any written authority, if ever such authority could be delegated by a Chief Justice, should have been given by then Chief Justice Sereno, who was the Chief Justice at the time the contracts were entered into with Ms. Macasaet, and not by any other previous Chief Justices. Previous Chief Justices had no authority to sign, much less delegate the authority to sign, government contracts after their term of office. </p><p> More importantly, the authority given to Atty. Candelaria by the previous Chief Justices, which was also the same authority given to her by then Chief Justice Sereno, referred only to the authority to sign for and in behalf of their communications with other government agencies and the transmittal of Court <i>En Banc</i> Resolutions to concerned agencies, as well as to "<b>internal personnel matters</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The Memorandum of Atty. Candelaria dated 29 August 2012<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> approved by then Chief Justice Sereno specifically enumerated the documents for which Atty.

Candelaria was actually given the authority by then Chief Justice Sereno to sign the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet, and that the basis of this authority is the <b>action slip</b> issued by Atty. Ocampo which states: </p><blockquote> <p> "I am pleased to furnish your office a copy of the Contract of Services between the Supreme Court and Ms. Helen Macasaet. </p> <p> <b>Also attached for your reference is the authorization from the Chief Justice to execute the said Contract of Services.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Contrary to the argument of Justice Caguioa that the action slip is "proof that she was in fact given express written authority by the former Chief Justice to sign and execute the Contracts of Services on the latter's behalf,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court finds that the action slip issued by Atty.

Ocampo and Mr. Davis. <b>The Contract of Services dated 23 May 2014 signed by Atty. Candelaria and Ms. Macasaet does not contain any written authorization from then Chief Justice Sereno to Atty.

This recommendation is entirely different from a recommendation to authorize Atty.

Thus, the statement of Atty. Ocampo in the action slip that there was "authorization from the Chief Justice to <i>execute</i> the said Contract of Services" is misleading, or even false because the attached Joint Memorandum refers only to the approval by then Chief Justice Sereno of the recommendation of Atty. Ocampo and Mr. Davis that Ms. Macasaet is the most qualified consultant, and there is no delegation whatsoever of any authority to Atty.

(Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> This Court finds that Ms. Macasaet was not qualified to be considered a Highly Technical Consultant in relation to the implementation of the Updated EISP Project. Moreover, there was no actual need to hire a consultant for the mere overview of the implementation of the Updated EISP Project as the MISO Head is already sufficiently qualified to implement such project. </p><p> The Updated EISP Project includes, among others, <b>the upgrading of the Judiciary Data Center, cabling and site preparation and connectivity and network security. </b>These activities require highly specialized technical ICT expertise, not general business management expertise. More specifically, based on the Scope of Work of the 23 May 2014 Contract of Services as quoted below, the Updated EISP Project <b>includes the upgrade of existing judiciary Data Center and the <i>design and construction</i> of the Judiciary Data Center Disaster Site. </b>Thus, the Updated EISP Project is not merely a general business project, but primarily a highly technical ICT infrastructure project, which Ms. Macasaet is not specially qualified to review or oversee. </p><p> The Scope of Work of the Contract of Services will show that the work did not require the additional services of a general business management consultant.

This is simply absurd. For the implementation of a highly technical project such as the EISP, a consultant with highly technical qualifications is required. <b>For the Terms of Reference to substitute <i>an advanced degree in ICT with an advanced degree in business management</i> is a highly irregular and inconsistent requirement.

To repeat, it was only upon the issuance of the Joint Circular on 15 June 2017 that "prevailing market rates" applied to consultancy fees of individuals. Nonetheless, in this case, the only Contract of Services which was entered into after 15 June 2017 was the eighth or last Contract of Services of Ms. Macasaet which was entered into on 24 July 2017. It is worth noting, however, that the period of engagement for this last contract was for a period of six (6) months from 24 May 2017, which was <b>before the issuance of the Joint Circular. </b></p><p> Atty.

Thus, prevailing market rates could not have applied to the Contracts of Services entered into from 2013 to 2016, or prior to 15 June 2017. Worse, there was absolutely no basis given for the cost of consultancy services in the first Contract of Services with Ms. Macasaet. The first market research was embodied only in Atty.

To prepare the APP, the implementing units of the Procuring Entity shall formulate the PPMPs for their different Programs, Activities, and Projects (PAPs). The PPMPs shall be submitted to the Procuring Entity's Budget Office for evaluation to ensure consistency with the budget proposal and compliance with existing budget rules. As soon as the General Appropriations Act (GAA) is enacted, the end-user or implementing units shall revise and adjust the PPMPs to reflect the budgetary allocation for their respective PAPs. The APP shall be submitted to the Government Procurement Policy Board on or before the end of January of the budget year, and shall be posted in accordance with law. </p><p> Thus, the inclusion of all the planned procurements in the APP is crucial to ensure that all expenses and expenditures of a government entity in relation to its procurement are within the approved appropriation as reflected in the corresponding GAA. </p><p> In this case, when the second Contract of Services dated 23 May 2014 was entered into, the APP for the year 2014 did not include the line item for "Technical and Policy Consultants" for purposes of procurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> This was only included when the APP was subsequently revised, in accordance with the Memorandum of the Procurement Planning Committee (PPC), where the PPC requested the amendment of the APP with the inclusion of the line item for "Technical and Policy Consultants" to be sourced from the savings of the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> <b>The recommendation to include the line item for "Technical and Policy Consultants" in the addendum to the 2014 Annual Procurement Plan was only approved by the Court in A.M.

To repeat, while the APP may be revised in accordance with the applicable guidelines, such revision should precede the procurement of services not found in the original APP for the applicable fiscal year. </p><p> Moreover, it is doubtful that the savings of the Court could be transferred to the hiring of a technical and policy consultant, <b>which was a non-existent item before the APP was amended.</b> In <i>Sanchez v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the Court held that for a transfer of appropriation, two essential requisites must be complied with - first, there must be savings in the programmed appropriation of the transferring agency, and second, there must be an <b><i>existing</i></b> item, project or activity with an appropriation in the receiving agency to which the savings will be transferred. In <i>Sanchez v. Commission on Audit</i>, the Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Clearly, there are two essential requisites in order that a transfer of appropriation with the corresponding funds may legally be effected. <i>First</i>, there must be savings in the programmed appropriation of the transferring agency. <i>Second</i>, there must be an existing item, project or activity with an appropriation in the receiving agency to which the savings will be transferred. </p> <p> Actual savings is a<i> sine qua non</i> to a valid transfer of funds from one government agency to another. The word "actual" denotes that something is real or substantial, or exists presently in fact as opposed to something which is merely theoretical, possible, potential or hypothetical. </p> <p> As a case in point, the Chief Justice himself transfers funds only when there are actual savings, <i>e.g</i>., from unfilled positions in the Judiciary. </p> <p> The thesis that savings may and should be presumed from the mere transfer of funds is plainly anathema to the doctrine laid down in <i>Demetria v. Alba</i> as it makes the prohibition against transfer of appropriations the general rule rather than the stringent exception the constitutional framers clearly intended it to be. It makes a mockery of <i>Demetria v. Alba</i> as it would have the Court allow the mere expectancy of savings to be transferred. </p> <p> Contrary to another submission in this case, the President, Chief Justice, Senate President, and the heads of constitutional commissions need not first prove and declare the existence of savings before transferring funds, the Court in <i>Philconsa v. Enriquez</i>, x x x, categorically declared that the Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, as the case may be, shall approve the realignment (of savings). However, "[B]efore giving their stamp of approval, these two officials will have to see to it that: (1) The funds to be realigned or transferred are actually savings in the items of expenditures from which the same are to be taken; and (2) The transfer or realignment is for the purpose of augmenting the items of expenditure to which said transfer or realignment is to be made." </p> <p> As it is, the fact that the permissible transfers contemplated by Section 25(5), Article VI of the 1987 Constitution would occur entirely within the framework of the executive, legislative, judiciary, or the constitutional commissions, already makes wanton and unmitigated malversation of public funds all too easy, without the Court abetting it by ruling that transfer of funds<i> ipso facto</i> denotes the existence of savings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, there was no item, project or activity for the hiring of the technical and policy consultants in 2014 before the APP was amended to include such line item. Thus, clearly, any savings from the budget of the Supreme Court could not have been transferred to a then non-existent item. As this Court held in <i>Sanchez v. Commission on Audit</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> As regards the requirement that there be an item to be augmented, which is also a <i>sine qua non</i> like the first requirement on the existence of savings, there was no item for augmentation in the appropriation for the Office of the President at the time of the transfers in question. Augmentation denotes that an appropriation was determined to be deficient after the implementation of the project or activity for which an appropriation was made, or after an evaluation of the needed resources. To say that the existing items in the appropriation for the Office of the President already needed augmentation as early as 31 January 1992 is putting the cart before the horse. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> The absence of any item to be augmented starkly projects the illegality of the diversion of the funds and the profligate spending thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <b>NO PROPER APPROPRIATION</b></p><p> Moreover, since the line item for "Technical and Policy Consultants" was not initially included in the APP for 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> it was also not considered in the evaluation of the budgetary proposal of the Supreme Court for consistency and compliance with existing budget rules. The budget proposal is submitted to Congress for the enactment of the GAA.

The CAF must be attached to the "<strong>proposed contract</strong>," at the latest, <strong>at the time of the signing of the contract, before the "proposed contract" is entered into by the signing of the contract. </strong> </p><p> The CAF cannot be attached to the contract after the contract is entered into because Section 86 expressly requires that "<em><strong>no contract x x x shall be entered into</strong></em><strong>" without the required CAF being "<em>attached to x x x the proposed contract</em>." </strong>Unless the CAF is so attached to the contract so as to become an integral part of the contract before the signing of the contract, the contract "<strong>shall be void</strong>" as expressly declared in Section 87 of PD No. 1445.

In <i>Philippine National Railways v. Kanlaon Construction Enterprises Co., Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> this Court held that contracts entered into without an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure in the contract and a CAF attesting that funds are available for such contract shall render the contract void. The failure to comply with <i>any</i> of these two requirements shall render the contract void. The Court held: </p><blockquote> <p> Thus, the Administrative Code of 1987 expressly prohibits the entering into contracts involving the expenditure of public funds <b>unless two prior requirements are satisfied. </b>First, there must be an appropriation law authorizing the expenditure required in the contract. <b>Second, there must be attached to the contract a certification by the proper accounting official and auditor that funds have been appropriated by law and such funds are available.</b> Failure to comply with any of these two requirements renders the contract void. </p> <p> In several cases, the Court had the occasion to apply these provisions of the Administrative Code of 1987 and the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines. In these cases, the Court clearly ruled that the two requirements - the existence of appropriation and the attachment of the certification - are "conditions <i>sine qua non</i> for the execution of government contracts." </p> <p> In <i>COMELEC v. Quijano-Padilla</i>, we stated: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is quite evident from the tenor of the language of the law that the existence of appropriations and the availability of funds are indispensable pre-requisites to or conditions <i>sine qua non</i> for the execution of government contracts. The obvious intent is to impose such conditions as <i>a priori </i>requisites to the validity of the proposed contract. </p> </blockquote> <p> The law expressly declares void a contract that fails to comply with the two requirements, namely, an appropriation law funding the contract and a certification of appropriation and fund availability. The clear purpose of these requirements is to insure that government contracts are never signed unless supported by the corresponding appropriation law and fund availability. </p> <p> The three contracts between PNR and Kanlaon do not comply with the requirement of a certification of appropriation and fund availability. Even if a certification of appropriation is not applicable to PNR if the funds used are internally generated, still a certificate of fund availability is required. Thus, the three contracts between PNR and Kanlaon are void for violation of Sections 46, 47, and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987, as well as Sections 85, 86, and 87 of the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, based on the pronouncements of this Court, the CAF must be attached to the contract at the time the contract is entered into by the government and not later.

Ocampo, in his Comment, argues that despite the absence of the CAFs for the third to eighth contracts, there was compliance with the CAF requirement, as the payments to Ms. Macasaet were covered by an Obligation Request and a Disbursement Voucher, where the chief accountant of the Supreme Court certified the availability of the funds for the consultancy fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><p> This Court finds his arguments untenable. </p><p> The law is absolutely clear on the requirement that <strong>before</strong> any obligation chargeable against any authorized allotment is incurred, there must be a CAF or a certification <strong>from the Chief Accountant</strong> as to the allotment against which the expenditure will be charged, and that funds are available for such expenditure. This certificate required by law cannot be replaced by mere Obligation Requests and Disbursement Vouchers, which serve different purposes from that of a CAF which certifies that there are funds actually appropriated for the contract to be executed, and that such funds are actually available to be expended. The Obligation Requests and Disbursement Vouchers are not the certification from the chief accountant that is required by Section 40 of Book VI, Chapter 5 and Section 47, Title I, Book V, Subtitle B, Chapter 8 of the Administrative Code of 1987 or Section 86 of PD No. 1445. </p><p> In an Obligation Request, the Head of the Requesting Office or his authorized representative certifies on the necessity and legality of the charges to the budget under his supervision, and the validity, propriety and legality of the supporting documents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In the same Obligation Request, the Head of the Budget Unit or his authorized representative certifies on the availability of allotment obligated for the purpose as indicated therein. In particular, COA Circular No. 003-06<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> provides: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify">2.2</div></td> <td width="98%"><div align="justify">The Head of the Budget Unit shall certify the availability of allotment and obligations incurred in the [Obligation Request] or budget and utilization in the [Budget Utilization Request]. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thus, it is clear that the obligation indicated in the Obligation Request has already been incurred, and that the Head of the Budget Unit simply certifies as to the availability of the allotment obligated for such purpose.</strong> This Obligation Request is prepared in three copies and distributed as follows - the original is attached to the Disbursement Voucher, the duplicate is given to the Budget Unit, and the triplicate is given to the Accounting Unit. <strong>This differs from a CAF which is signed by the Chief Accountant and is required to be attached to the contract entered into by the government <em>before</em> any obligation chargeable against any authorized allotment is incurred or authorized.</strong> The obligation becomes chargeable upon perfection of the contract, and that takes place upon the signing of the contract by the parties. </p> <p> On the other hand, a Disbursement Voucher contains the certification by the Head of Accounting Unit or his authorized representative on the availability of cash, subject to Advice to Debit Accounts, on the completeness of the supporting documents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> It also contains the approval by the Head of the Agency or his authorized representative on the payment covered by the Disbursement Voucher. Finally, the same Disbursement Voucher contains the acknowledgment by the claimant or his duly authorized representative for the receipt of the check or cash, and the date of such receipt. <b>Simply put, the Disbursement Voucher merely records the mode of payment made to the payee indicated therein, and certifies that the cash for such disbursement is available and that the supporting documents for such disbursement are complete. </b></p><p> It is clear, therefore, that the Obligation Requests and the Disbursement Vouchers are not the certification required by law to be secured <strong>before</strong> an obligation is incurred by the government, which certification shows that funds have been appropriated by law and that such funds are available therefor. Obligation Request, Budget Utilization Request, and Disbursement Voucher are mere forms prescribed by the Commission on Audit, to be used in recording obligations incurred, budget utilization, and disbursements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> </p><p> Justice Caguioa, in his Dissenting Opinion, agrees with the finding of the OCAt that no CAF was issued prior to entering into the third to eighth Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> but raises the argument that since there is no particular form required to be followed for the issuance of the CAF, the Obligation Requests and Disbursement Vouchers which were issued before the payments to Ms. Macasaet are compliant with the CAF requirement under the law. </p><p> The Court disagrees. </p><p> Again, what is required by law is a CAF <strong>before</strong> any obligation chargeable against any authorized allotment is incurred. This also means that the CAF must be secured <strong>before</strong> the services are performed or the goods are delivered. That there were an Obligation Request and a Disbursement Voucher before payment was made to Ms. Macasaet is entirely irrelevant and immaterial because the law requires the CAF <strong>before the obligation is incurred</strong> - not thereafter when the obligation is paid. Clearly, when payment is made, the obligation had already been incurred and performed. </p><p> The Obligation Request and Disbursement Voucher, while made before payment, are issued after the obligation chargeable against the authorized allotment is incurred. Even if the law does not require the CAF to be in any particular form, an Obligation Request or a Disbursement Voucher cannot replace the CAF required by law because the law clearly states that there must be a CAF <strong>before</strong> such obligation is actually incurred or authorized. </p><p> <b>ALL THE CONTRACTS OF SERVICES ARE VOID</b></p><p> <b>In summary, all the eight (8) Contracts of Services must be declared void <i>ab initio</i>.</b> </p><p> It is beyond doubt that (1) the lack of authority of the government signatory; (2) lack of qualifications of Ms. Macasaet; (3) the excessive amount of consultancy fees; (4) the incurrence of obligation and the expenditure of public funds without the proper appropriation; and (5) the absence of the required CAFs render the subject Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet void <em>ab initio</em>. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DECLARES</b> the subject eight (8) Contracts of Services with Ms. Helen P.

Michael B. Ocampo (Atty. Ocampo), then Court Attorney V, Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ), and Mr. Edilberto A. Davis (Mr. Davis), then Acting Chief, Management Information Systems Office (MISO), stated that after reviewing and evaluating the qualifications of the three consultants vis-a-vis the requirements of the TOR, they had determined that Ms. Macasaet was the most qualified among the three proposed consultants; hence, they recommended that Ms. Macasaet be hired for the procurement. This recommendation was approved by the former Chief Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> On October 1, 2013, the services of Ms. Macasaet as consultant were engaged through a Contract of Services.

Relative thereto, she requested the (1) approval of the Final Report; (2) issuance of the Certificate of Final Acceptance attesting to the completion of her work under the contract; and (3) release of the performance security in the amount of P30,000.00 which she posted. These requests were approved by the former Chief Justice on April 1, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> The first contract ended on March 30, 2014.

Ocampo, in his Memorandum to the former Chief Justice dated April 16, 2014, stated that there is "a need for a technical and policy consultant for the implementation of the Updated EISP Work Plan," thereby enumerating the scope of work of the consultant. He proposed that the consultant be paid a fee of P250,000.00 a month or P1,500,000.00 for the six-month contract period, inclusive of all applicable taxes, and to directly negotiate a six-month contract with the consultant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> For the mode of procurement, the Memorandum states the following: </p><blockquote> <p> Under Section 53.7 of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9184, a procuring entity can forego public bidding and directly negotiate a 6-month contract (subject to renewal) with a consultant, who will perform work that is highly technical or proprietary and primarily confidential or policy determining. </p> <p> The proposed consultancy is clearly highly technical and policy determining; however, this will be subject to the confirmation of the [BAC-CS] in line with the procedures previously observed in the case of the EISP Review and Update consultancy. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> This Memorandum was approved by the former Chief Justice upon the recommendation of Atty.

Cunanan, as PPC Chairperson, the proposed TOR for the Consultancy on the Implementation of the Updated Work Plan of the EISP of the Judiciary.</p><p> On May 9, 2014, upon the request of Atty. Cunanan, Atty. Garcia issued a Certification, noted by Atty. Flores, which reads: </p><blockquote> <p align="center"><strong> <big>CERTIFICATION</big></strong></p> <p> This is to certify that the amount of <strong>ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P1,500,000.00)</strong> will be made available to cover the consultancy fee for the Consultancy Agreement, in connection with the Implementation of the Updated Enterprise Information Systems Plan (EISP) of the Judiciary.

As such, the BAC-CS was of the view that there was no need for the procurement to pass through the regular process of engaging consultants being conducted by it, citing Section 53 of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 on Negotiated Procurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> In a Memorandum dated May 20, 2014, acting on the recommendation of the BAC-CS, Mr. Davis and Atty.

Like the first contract, the Court was represented by Atty. Candelaria, as Chief Administrative Officer, with Attys. Ocampo and Garcia as witnesses, and the same was acknowledged before then Clerk of Court Atty. Vidal. On the same day, Ms. Macasaet posted a performance bond in the amount of P75,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> The second Contract of Services ended on November 23, 2014. A Certificate of Final Acceptance signed by the former Chief Justice was issued to Ms. Macasaet. Atty. Ocampo recommended the issuance of the Certificate of Completion while Atty. Oliveros and Mr. Davis recommended the issuance of the Certificate of Final Completion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> <i>Third to Eighth Contracts of Services<br> (Extensions/Renewal of Contracts)</i> </p><p> In a Joint Memorandum dated December 1, 2014, Mr. Davis and Atty. Ocampo recommended the extension of Ms. Macasaet's contract for another six months, explaining that: </p><blockquote> <p> Considering that the implementation of the Updated EISP is just at its starting point, <strong>there is a continuing need for the services of the Consultant to provide technical advice and assistance</strong> in the first year implementation of the plan <strong>and in developing ICT policies to support it.</strong> Under the Government Procurement Reform Act, a procuring entity may directly negotiate a contract with a highly technical consultant like Ms. Macasaet, and the contract shall, at the most, be on a six month basis, <em>renewable at the option of the appointing Head of the Procuring Entity, but in no case shall exceed the term of the latter</em>. (<strong>This has been confirmed by the Procurement Planning Committee and the Supreme Court Bids and Awards Committee for Consultancy Services</strong>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> This recommendation was approved by the former Chief Justice. Hence, on December 10, 2014, the Court entered into a third Contract of Services with Ms. Macasaet. Again, the Contract was signed by Atty. Candelaria for and in behalf of the Court, with Attys. Ocampo and Garcia as witnesses, and acknowledged before Atty. Vidal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> The third Contract of Services ended on May 23, 2015. On June 9, 2015, a Certificate of Final Acceptance was issued to Ms. Macasaet. Atty. Ocampo recommended the issuance of the Certificate of Completion while Atty. Oliveros and Mr. Davis recommended the issuance of the Certificate of Final Completion. The same was signed by the former Chief Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> In a Memorandum dated June 10, 2015, Mr. Davis and Atty. Ocampo requested for the second extension of the contract of Ms. Macasaet for another six months. They stated that "[considering that the implementation of the Updated EISP is continuing, with the procurement for key application systems scheduled for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of 2015, there is a continuing need for the services of the Consultant to provide technical advice and assistance in the first- and second-year EISP implementation and in developing ICT policies to support it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> To validate the findings with respect to the consultancy fees of Ms. Macasaet, Atty. Ocampo reiterated in his Memorandum dated June 22, 2015 the following pertinent sections of his April 16, 2014 Memorandum as regards the Second Contract: </p><blockquote> <p> To further benchmark Ms. Macasaet's consultancy fees, in June 2015, I requested information regarding the cost of similar consultancies from the Office of Usec. Richard Moya of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), who serves as the DBM's Chief Information Officer in charge of reviewing IT-related expenditures in the DBM and other government offices.</p> <p> According to Mr. Christopher A. Kuzhuppilly of the Digitization Project Coordination Unit under the Office of Usec. Moya, the DBM hired "an individual IT consultant [2012] to craft the TOR, conduct requirements gathering, consultation, coordination, provide policy advice, etc. x x x for the Comprehensive Human Resource Information System (CHRIS), commonly known as the National Payroll System." Mr. [Kuzhuppilly] also furnished a copy of the terms of reference of the said consultancy, which shows that the monthly fee given to DBM consultant was P92,000 per month.</p> <p> Comparing the scope of work of the DBM consultant and the proposed TOR of Ms. Macasaet, it is my assessment that the consultancy fees of Ms. Macasaet are reasonable. <em>First</em>, the DBM consultant was only required to develop the terms of reference of one application, which is just a sub-component of the Enterprise Resource Planning System that Ms. Macasaet will work on. In addition, Ms. Macasaet will work on the TOR of another application system, the Philippine Judicial Academy eLearning System. <em>Second</em>, unlike the DBM consultant, Ms. Macasaet is also required to be part of the technical working group that will <strong>review the bid documents for twelve (12) ICT procurement projects.</strong> This will require her to attend pre-bid conferences and review technical bids during the post-qualification stage of 12 procurements. <em>Third</em>, Ms. Macasaet is doing quality assurance for another application system development project, the eCourts, which is the case management system of the Judiciary. Thus, all in all, Ms. Macasaet is involved in 9 application system projects, 6 ICT infrastructure projects (including the construction of regional data centers) and 1 human resource development project. Finally, Ms. Macasaet has to attend the monthly meetings of the CCL and its subcommittees (2-3 meetings per month) aside from addressing regular technical questions regularly referred to her by the [OCJ] and MISO.</p> <p> In view of the foregoing, the recommendation in the 10 June 2015 Memorandum to extend Ms. Macasaet's contract for another 6 months is respectfully reiterated. (emphasis and italics in the original)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Acting on the two Memoranda dated June 10 and 22, 2015, the former Chief Justice approved on June 23, 2015 the recommended extension of the Contract of Services of Ms. Macasaet for another six months. Thus, another Contract of Services was executed on June 23, 2015 between the Court and Ms. Macasaet which was signed by Atty. Candelaria for and in behalf of the Court, with Attys. Ocampo and Garcia as witnesses, and acknowledged before Atty. Vidal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> At the end of each Contract of Services, a Certificate of Final Acceptance is issued to Ms. Macasaet and a Joint Memorandum is submitted to the former Chief Justice for approval, citing the "continuing need for the services of the Consultant to provide technical advice and assistance" as basis for the extension of the services of Ms. Macasaet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The details of the issuance of the Certificates of Final Acceptance at the end of each contract period and the submission of a Joint Memorandum for the extension of the services of Ms. Macasaet are shown in the table below as contained in the OCAt Report: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="12%"><div align="center"><strong>End of <br> Contract Period</strong></div></td> <td width="38%"><div align="center"><strong>Date of Joint Memorandum <br> Justifying the Extension</strong></div></td> <td width="18%"><div align="center"><strong>Date of Contract </strong></div></td> <td width="17%"><div align="center"><strong>Contract Duration</strong></div></td> <td width="15%"><div align="center"><strong>Date of Certificate of Final Acceptance</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td valign="middle"><div align="center">November 23, 2014</div></td> <td><div align="justify">December 1, 2014 Joint Memo of Mr. Davis and Atty.

Her discussion was limited to three points: <em>first</em>, the legal premises utilized by the OCAt to determine the legality of the contract were patently erroneous; <em>second</em>, the OCAt came up with conclusions without factual support and sufficient research or were based on flawed presumptions; and<em> third</em>, there is a conspicuous absence in the OCAt Report of any comment or explanation from the offices and committees involved in the procurement, which renders questionable the procedure followed in the review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> On the<em> first point</em>, the former Chief Justice claimed that while the OCAt does not opine that public bidding should have been conducted for the procurement of Ms. Macasaet's services, it nonetheless applied legal provisions that are either inapplicable, taken out of their proper legal context, and/or pertain to an evaluation of short-listed consultants in a procurement project undertaken through competitive bidding. The former Chief Justice states that these rules are irrelevant and inapplicable to the procurement of consulting services using the negotiated method.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> According to the former Chief Justice, the OCAt also applied rules that, by their express wording, and by the OCAt's own admission, exclude the hiring of individual highly technical consultants from their coverage, as well as standards not yet in existence during the procurement of the services of Ms. Macasaet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Regarding the<em> second point</em>, the former Chief Justice identified certain conclusions made by the OCAt that were bereft of any factual support or based on flawed premises.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> On the<em> last</em> point, the former Chief Justice emphasized that the OCAt appeared to have circulated its opinion without reference to any comment or explanation from the BAC-CS, PPC, and the end-users of the services — the Committee on Computerization, MISO, and the OCJ. Since the conclusions contained in the OCAt Report involve the previous actions and findings of these committees and offices, the former Chief Justice claims that the basic tenets of due process and fairness dictate that the parties all be given a right to be heard — including Ms. Macasaet, the other party to the subject contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated January 10, 2018, the Court en banc resolved to note the former Chief Justice's letter. </p><p> <b><i>Comments of the Parties</i></b></p><p> Acting on the OCAt Report, the Court <em>en banc</em> issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated November 21, 2017 in A.M.

She stated that, as admitted in the OCAt Report, the services of a technical consultant had to be engaged to review the status of the EISP implementation and related ICT and computerization projects of the Judiciary because "nobody in the Judiciary, including any member of the MISO or the [Committee on Computerization and Library (CCL)], was competent to undertake such a monumental and unique task."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> Ms. Macasaet claimed that due to her limited personal knowledge of and participation in the procurement process of her ICT consultancy projects, in addition to her not being a legal professional, she is not competent to render a legal opinion regarding the validity of her eight Contracts of Services. Nevertheless, she maintains that she was made to believe, and still believes in all good faith, that all contracts are valid and lawful especially considering that she contracted with no less than the highest court of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> Assuming<em> arguendo</em> that the subject contracts are void and that she should be compensated on the basis of <em>quantum meruit</em> as the OCAt suggests, Ms. Macasaet avers that the compensation she received is reasonable from the government's perspective even though, from her perspective, such compensation is substantially below market rate. She argues that the factors<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> considered in determining the fees of lawyers may be applied by analogy to her case because lawyers and ICT consultants are both professionals, thus similarly situated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> Ms. Macasaet avers that, applying the foregoing factors, she should have instead charged or have been paid a monthly fee of P880,000.00, which is more than three times of what she actually received for the second to eighth contracts and almost nine times of what she received for the first one. Nonetheless, she maintains that she accepted the engagement as an ICT consultant not for the compensation but for a desire to give back to the country and contribute to its development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> Additionally, Ms. Macasaet disagrees with the OCAt's finding that the MISO Chief is an equivalent position; hence, the salary of the MISO Chief should not be used in determining the reasonableness of her compensation. She argues that nobody in MISO possesses her qualifications and expertise and that the EISP and other related ICT projects never took off until her services were engaged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, Ms. Macasaet claims that since the OCAt did not conduct any benchmarking or market research, it is in no position to conclude that the compensation she received was unreasonable. She notes the OCAt's suggestion that the benchmarking or market research on the value of the services that she rendered be undertaken by the FMBO, OAS, and MISO. In this regard, she requests for an opportunity to comment on their own benchmarking or market research.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> Finally, Ms. Macasaet disagrees with the OCAt's finding that the six-month term of each Contract of Services is "disadvantageous to the government" and that she should have been engaged instead for a longer period such as five years. She avers that such finding is completely speculative, unfounded, erroneous, and contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated January 23, 2018, the Court en banc noted the Comment filed by Ms. Macasaet. </p><p> <i>Comment of BAC-CS</i></p><p> On January 25, 2018, the BAC-CS filed its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> wherein it asserted in the main that the procedural requirements of prevailing procurement law were sufficiently met with respect to the subject contracts. </p><p> In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> dated January 30, 2018, the Court <em>en banc</em> noted the Comment filed by the BAC-CS and required Attys.

In the said Resolution, the Court resolved to declare the subject contracts void <em>ab initio</em> for five reasons: (1) the lack of authority of the government signatory; (2) the lack of qualifications of Ms. Macasaet; (3) the excessive amount of consultancy fees; (4) the incurrence of obligation and the expenditure of public funds without appropriation; and (5) the absence of the required CAFs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> Aside from declaring the subject contracts void <em>ab initio</em>, the Court likewise directed Ms. Macasaet to reimburse all the amounts she received under the subject contracts amounting to Eleven Million One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P11,100,000.00).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> <b><i><u>I strongly resister my dissent</u></i>. </b>With due respect, I deem the Court's act of nullifying the subject contracts as egregiously erroneous, and compelling Ms. Macasaet to reimburse the subject consultancy fees is a grave injustice. </p><p align="center"><em> <b>Reasons for the Dissent</b></em> </p><p> I discuss the merits of the factual and legal findings of the OCAt Report, including the grounds<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> not ruled upon by the <em>ponencia</em>: </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify"><b>I.</b> </div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><b><i>There is no lack of support of the Second Contract of Services in the 2014 Annual Procurement Plan (APP).</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>With respect to the subject contracts having support in the APPs approved by the Court <em>en banc</em>, the OCAt readily acknowledged that "there was diligent compliance with the requirements under Section 7 of R.A. 9184 that all procurements shall be included in the Annual Procurement Plan, x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> The OCAt alleged, however, that with respect to the Second Contract of Services entered into on May 23, 2014, the 2014 APP supposedly does not support its execution because of the purported failure of the 2014 APP to include an item on "Technical and Policy Consultants."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The<em> ponencia</em> agreed with the OCAt's findings and found that the subject procurement was not in accordance with an annual appropriation plan, and that there was no proper appropriation allotted to support the Second Contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> Under Section 7, Article II of R.A. 9184, no government procurement shall be undertaken unless it is in accordance with the approved APP of the Procuring Entity: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 7. <i>Procurement Planning and Budgeting Linkage</i>. - All procurement should be within the approved budget of the Procuring Entity and should be meticulously and judiciously planned by the Procuring Entity concerned.

In the case of Infrastructure Projects, the Plan shall include engineering design and acquisition of right-of-way. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Applying the foregoing provision of the law to the Second Contract of Services, it must be emphasized that <strong>in the 2014 APP, which was approved by the Court <em>en banc</em> in A.M. No. 10-1-10-SC,</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> <strong>a total of P436,448,080.00 was already <u>specifically allotted for the EISP</u>.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> <strong>Further, in the approved budget under the 2014 APP, funds were allotted for the further development of infrastructure and application systems under the EISP.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> To stress, the engagement of technical and policy consultants was part and parcel of the 2014 APP's allocation for the further development of infrastructure and application systems under the EISP. The very rationale and underlying purpose for the hiring of consultancy services under the subject contracts was precisely the further development of the EISP system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Hence, it cannot be said that the execution of the Second Contract of Services was without any basis in the 2014 APP as it was pursued for the further development of infrastructure and application systems under the EISP — an item provided for in the 2014 APP. Otherwise stated, even without the amended 2014 APP, with the 2014 APP having already provided allotments for the further development of infrastructure and application systems under the EISP, the Second Contract was entered into in accordance with an approved APP. </p><p> More importantly, even assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the 2014 APP did not cover the Second Contract of Services, the OCAt Report itself readily acknowledged that <strong>in another Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> dated September 23, 2014 in A.M.

It must be noted that under R.A. 9184, the law states that APPs relate to the entire duly approved <u>yearly</u> budget.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p><p> It must be emphasized as well that Section 7, Article II of R.A. 9184 specifically grants procuring entities (in this case, the Court) the power to revise and update their respective APPs that govern the procuring entities' spending in a fiscal year. Thus, the Court should recognize the ability of the amended 2014 APP to cover the Second Contract of Services that was entered into within the fiscal year as it is within the ambit of the Procuring Entity's power under R.A. 9184 to revise the APP applicable for a given fiscal year. Adopting a different stance to the effect that an amended APP would not be able to sufficiently cover a prior procurement activity would render futile, useless, and nugatory the power specifically granted to procuring entities under Section 7, Article II of R.A. 9184 to revise and update their respective APPs. Therefore, it is certainly the intent of the law that an amended APP refers and pertains to the entire fiscal year, and not only the period subsequent to its issuance.

No. 08-11-09-SC, the Court <em>en banc </em>described the EISP as a comprehensive framework of several ICT initiatives, involving the development of new information systems and provision of state-of-the-art IT equipment. It must be stressed that the project pertains <b>not only to the Court alone, but to the <u>entire judiciary</u></b>, composed of all the courts and its adjunct offices around the Philippines. The Court <i>en banc</i> explained that: </p><blockquote> <p> The EISP is intended to serve as the framework of ICT initiatives of the Judiciary for the next five years (Yr. 2010-2014). It contains the present ICT needs of the Judiciary and proposed solutions vis-a-vis the [organization's] mandate, objectives, and programs through the development of new Information Systems (IS) and provision of additional state-of-the-art IT equipment.

More specifically, based on the Scope of Work of the [May 23, 2014] Contract of Services as quoted below, the Updated EISP Project includes the upgrade of existing Judiciary Data Center and the design and construction of the Judiciary Data Center Disaster Site. <b>Thus, the Updated EISP Project is <u>not merely a general business project, but primarily a highly technical ICT infrastructure project</u></b>, x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> </p><p> Hence, this belies the <em>ponencia</em>'s own assessment that "the general ICT services required under such EISP could have been implemented by the Supreme Court's MISO"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> considering that there is already an acknowledgment that the work involved in the subject contracts "is not merely a general business project, but primarily a highly technical ICT infrastructure project."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> </p><p> Further, the task of reviewing, assessing, and updating the EISP could not have been simply left to MISO and its Chief of Office. While not questioning the competency and qualifications of the MISO and its Chief of Office, the latter cannot be expected to sufficiently handle the EISP project because, to reiterate, <strong>the EISP encompasses not merely the ICT system of the Court alone; it involves the development of the complex IT framework and other computerization projects covering <u>the<i> entire</i> judiciary as an institution</u></strong>. According to A.M. No. 92-3-021-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> <u>the mandate of the MISO is limited</u> to providing technological services and managing the computerized monitoring system installed <u>in the Supreme Court</u> — this does not include the other courts in the country. The <em>ponencia</em> completely and utterly failed to consider that the review of the IT framework of the entire judiciary is beyond the scope of the MISO's mandate. </p><p> Furthermore, it must be noted that since the EISP encompasses the IT initiatives of the entire judiciary, <b><u>its review necessarily includes an evaluation of the projects and initiatives of the MISO</u></b>. Thus, in the TOR, among the tasks of the consultant for the Updated EISP are: (a) to provide technical and policy advice to the OCJ and the MISO regarding the implementation of the Updated EISP Work Plan and related computerization and ICT Projects; and (b) <b><u>review the MISO Reengineering Development Plan (MRDP) and update it according to the requirements of the Updated EISP Work Plan</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Surely, asking the MISO to review, assess, and evaluate its own IT projects and initiatives, instead of by an independent, highly technical consultant, would be inimical to developing an improved IT system for the judiciary. </p><p> Lastly, it should be noted that along with Atty. Ocampo, it was Mr. Davis, then Acting Chief of the MISO, who recommended Ms. Macasaet to be the consultant for the Updated EISP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> <b><u>Verily, the MISO itself recognized the need to hire a consultant in the person of Ms. Macasaet for such undertaking</u></b>. </p><p> Therefore, considering that the EISP involves the development and implementation of a complex web of IT systems that will cover the entire judiciary, including the provision of state-of-the-art IT equipment, designed to assist the judiciary in achieving its very mandate, any pronouncement that the EISP is a "simple" IT project that can be reviewed by any IT consultant fails to fully comprehend the intricacy, complexity, and importance of the EISP. </p><p> Telling is the fact that <u>even the OCAt Report itself does not question the recommendation of the BAC-CS</u> that the work involved in reviewing and updating the EISP, as well as the related ICT and computerization projects, is highly technical in nature. In recognizing the highly technical nature of the EISP, the OCAt even acknowledged that the instant case involved '"x x x <b>the hiring of individual consultants under special cases', such as these instant procurements</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Thus, it is quite bewildering how the <em>ponencia</em> can take a contrary position. </p><p> Therefore, the question now redounds to whether or not the procurement of the subject contracts followed the prescribed procedure required for the alternative method of Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Alleged Faulty Participation of the BAC-CS in the Negotiated Procurement of the Subject Contracts</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In essence, the OCAt Report alleges that the procurement of the subject contracts was legally infirm because the BAC-CS did not participate in the Negotiated Procurement process in the manner required by law. This is because, as soon as it resolved that the subject contracts were to be subjected to Negotiated Procurement, the BAC-CS "purportedly prematurely terminated its role" — the OCAt Report asserting that the BAC-CS should have itself conducted the rigors of negotiation,<em> i.e</em>., that it should have discussed, clarified, finalized the TOR and the Scope of Services; conducted extensive discussions on the methodology and work program, qualifications and compensation, financial proposal, and the other aspects of the subject contracts; posted an opportunity to bid in the required websites; recommended not only the resort to alternative modes of procurement but also the actual awarding of the subject contracts to Ms. Macasaet; issued Notices of Award; and issued Notices to Proceed. </p><p> Upon close examination of the applicable law and rules applicable to Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants, the OCAt's findings on the supposed failure of the BAC-CS to actively participate in the subject procurement are egregiously mistaken. </p><p> First and foremost, it must be reiterated that Negotiated Procurement is defined by R.A. 9184 as an alternative method of procurement whereby "<b><u>the Procuring Entity <i>directly</i> negotiates</u> a contract with a technically, legally and financially capable supplier, contractor or consultant</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> It is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that where the terms of the statute are clear and unambiguous, no interpretation is called for, and the law is applied as written.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Hence, it is clear that in procuring goods or services through Negotiated Procurement, the negotiation process is <b><i><u>directly</u></i></b> managed and facilitated by the Procuring Entity itself, <u><b>and not by the BAC as alleged by the OCAt Report</b></u>. </p><p> Consistent with the clear and unequivocal provision of law that it is the Procuring Entity that directly negotiates in a Negotiated Procurement, <b><u>there is nothing in the prevailing provisions governing alternative methods of procurement that even remotely suggests that the BAC shall be responsible for the actual negotiation process in a Negotiated Procurement</u></b>. What R.A. 9184 provides is that the BAC shall recommend to the Procuring Entity if an alternative mode of procurement should be pursued. In the instant case, it is undisputed that the BAC-CS indeed issued such recommendations for the procurement of the subject contracts via Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants. </p><p> <b><u>Thus, the overall theory posed by the OCAt that the BAC-CS should have "taken the lead" in the process of Negotiated Procurement of the subject contracts is completely lacking in legal basis</u></b>. </p><p> In arguing that the BAC-CS itself should have facilitated the nitty gritty process of negotiating with the highly technical consultant, the OCAt Report refers to <strong>Section 33.2.5 of the 2009 IRR </strong>which provides the coverage of the negotiation process. <b><u>However, even just a cursory perusal of these provisions would make it readily evident that such provision is not applicable to Negotiated Procurement</u></b>. </p><p> The aforementioned provision explaining the acts that make up the process of negotiation is under Section 33 of the 2009 IRR on "<b><u>Bid</u></b> Evaluation of Short Listed <b><u>Bidders</u></b> for Consulting Services". Moreover, Section 33 and its sub-sections are under Rule IX on "Bid Evaluation." Evidently, these provisions of the law apply only to the procurement of goods and services through the <b>bidding process</b> — <b><u>they do not apply to the procurement of goods and services through Negotiated Procurement</u></b>. </p><p> It must be stressed that under R. A. 9184, the advertisement of bidding, holding of a pre-bid conference, eligibility screening of prospective bidders, and receipt, opening and evaluation of bids are at the very center of the procurement method of Competitive Bidding or Public Bidding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Clearly, <b><u>the concept of bidding is generally incongruent with the concept of procurement under Negotiated Procurement of a Highly Technical Consultant</u></b>, wherein instead of undergoing a bidding procedure where interested parties are open to participate, the Procuring Entity and the consultant <b><u>directly engage each other</u></b> in negotiation. <b><u>Hence, the manifest error committed by the OCAt Report was to apply legal provisions governing bidding procedure to a procurement process that does not involve bidding. To stress, this was unwarranted, completely baseless and therefore egregiously erroneous</u>. </b></p><p> Moreover, it must also be noted that Section 5(d) of R.A. 9184 defines a <b>bid</b> as <b>a signed offer or proposal submitted by a supplier, manufacturer, distributor, contractor or consultant <u>in response to the Bidding Documents</u></b>. </p><p> As acknowledged by the OCAt Report itself, the procurement of the subject contracts is <b><u>a "special case" wherein the "tender of the usual bid documents" is "done away" with</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Thus, in expressly recognizing that the process of Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants does not include bidding documents, the OCAt concedes that the concept of a bid does not apply to the procurement of the subject contracts. <b><u>Necessarily, therefore, provisions that apply only to bidding should not be made to apply in the instant case</u></b>. </p><p> It must also be noted that the provision on the coverage of the negotiation process under Section 33.2.5 of the 2009 IRR which, again, was the legal basis of the OCAt Report to find fault against the BAC-CS, <u>was expressly included in the process of procuring consultancy services under <b>Competitive Bidding</b> in the Manual of Procedures</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> It is very telling that the same provision was <b><u>NOT</u></b> included in the process of procuring consultancy services under Negotiated Procurement in the same Manual. This should have convinced the Court that the acts of negotiation under Section 33.2.5 of the 2009 IRR do not find application in the instant case. </p><p> Aside from Section 33.2.5 of the 2009 IRR, the OCAt Report likewise cited as legal basis the Manual of Procedures. It argued that under the section on Negotiated Procurement found in the Manual of Procedures, it explicitly states that the BAC shall participate in the Negotiated Procurement of consultancy services: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Who are the parties involved in negotiated procurement?</b> </p> <p> The following must participate in the procurement of consulting services using the negotiated procurement method: </p> <p> 1. The Head of the Procuring Entity; </p> <p>2. <b>The BAC</b>[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The OCAt Report made the argument that since the Manual of Procedures expressly identified the BAC as a party that must participate in the Negotiated Procurement process, then it should have actively participated in the actual negotiation process. <b><u>This reasoning by the OCAt is an unjustified leap in logic and fatally flawed</u></b>. </p> <p> There is no serious dispute that even as Negotiated Procurement involves direct negotiations between the Procuring Entity and the consultant, the BAC still has some level of participation in the process. That participation, however, is, as previously discussed, confined to merely recommending that the procurement of consultancy services may undergo Negotiated Procurement. In the case at hand, the BAC-CS did participate in the Negotiated Procurement of the subject contracts when it made such recommendation to the Procuring Entity. The OCAt, however, committed false equivalency in making its argument; it equated "participation" with "negotiation" — <i>without</i> any legal basis. <u>Simply stated, requiring the BAC to participate in the Negotiated Procurement does not mean that it is required to conduct the negotiation process itself.</u> <b><u>Otherwise, the clear and unequivocal provision of R.A. 9184 that the Procuring Entity directly negotiates with the consultant in a Negotiated Procurement is subrogated</u>. </b></p><p> Still on the Manual of Procedures, the OCAt also argued that it requires the observance of a set of requirements for Negotiated Procurement: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>How is negotiated procurement conducted? </b></p> <p> <b><u>Except for adjacent or contiguous projects and for the hiring of individual consultants under special cases</u></b>, negotiated procurement is conducted in the following manner: </p> <p align="center"> x x x x</p> <ol start="4"><li> If the Head of the Procuring Entity disapproves of the recommendation, he shall state the reason(s) of this disapproval and instruct the BAC on the subsequent steps to be adopted. If its recommendation is approved, <b>the BAC, through the TWG and the BAC Secretariat, finalizes the TOR and other action documents, including draft contracts, in accordance with the procedures laid down in this Manual and in the IRR-A</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </li></ol> </blockquote> <p> The OCAt Report maintained that since the aforementioned set of procedures expressly states that the BAC should finalize the TOR and other action documents, the BAC-CS' failure to observe such procedure made the subject procurement infirm. </p><p> <b><u>Again</u></b>, the OCAt's finding is wholly unavailing. As manifestly evident in the cited provision itself, the procedural requirements referred to shall <b><i><u>not</u></i></b> apply to the hiring of individual consultants under special cases. The subject procurement certainly falls under such "special cases". As already explained above, the subject contracts involve extremely technical and complex matters that are not easily comprehensible to laymen. Further, these contracts touch upon one of the priority projects of the Court. Thus, it is not difficult to understand that such procurement involved primarily confidential or policy determining matters where trust and confidence are the primary considerations for the hiring of the consultant. </p><p> In any case, it bears much stressing that no less than the OCAt Report itself unequivocally acknowledged that <u><strong>[t]he above quoted procedure</strong></u><strong> on how the alternative method of negotiated procurement is conducted, through its first line, <u>categorically takes out from its coverage</u> 'x x x <u>the hiring of individual consultants under special cases', such as these instant procurements</u>.</strong>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> </p><p> The OCAt's argument that the BAC-CS is still required to undergo the "required negotiation" despite the foregoing unmistakable provision in the Manual of Procedures accordingly lacks legal basis. </p><p> The OCAt mentioned a GPPB Non-Policy Opinion which purportedly states that the verification, validation, and the ascertainment of the eligibility and qualifications of the consultant should still be pursued in negotiations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> However, a fair reading of the said GPPB Non-Policy Opinion shows that it only mentions that the aforementioned procedure be done in the negotiation stage; <b><u>it does not hold that such acts must be done by the BAC and not the Procuring Entity</u></b>. </p><p> To further bolster the fact that the procedures found in the Manual of Procedures do not apply to Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants, it is worthy to mention that one of the procedures found in the cited list of procedures, i.e., item no. 6 or the posting by the BAC of the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid, was <b><u>expressly excluded</u></b> for Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants under the 2009 IRR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> The rationale of this exclusion of the posting requirement with respect to Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants is obvious — because in such a mode of procurement, the Procuring Entity directly and personally negotiates with the consultant based on his/her qualifications, skills, and other personal circumstances, with trust and confidence being the primary considerations.<b> Hence, the OCAt's finding that the BAC-CS violated the procurement law because it failed to show "posting of opportunity in the PhilGEPS website, SC website, and the SC bulletin boards x x x"</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> <b>is terribly erroneous.</b> </p><p> Even with respect to the BAC-CS' alleged failure to submit and evaluate the eligibility requirements of Ms. Macasaet, such argument of the OCAt Report fails to find any legal basis. There is absolutely no provision under R.A. 9184, its 2009 IRR, and the Manual of Procedures which requires the BAC to manage and evaluate the eligibility requirements of a consultant engaged through Negotiated Procurement of a Highly Technical Consultant. </p><p> In fact, even the GPPB itself recognized in its Resolution No. 18-2015 that the law is "<b>[still] silent whether or not eligibility documents mentioned under the above-mentioned provisions must be submitted when resorting to any of the Alternative Methods of Procurement, except those where competitive bidding or a semblance thereof is still present.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup></p><p> In further insisting that the BAC-CS should have engaged in negotiations with Ms. Macasaet, the OCAt Report also cited Section V, D(7b)(ii) of the Consolidated Guidelines for the Alternative Methods of Procurement of the 2016 IRR of R.A. 9184, which states that the "BAC shall undertake the negotiation with the individual consultant based on the Terms of Reference prepared by the End-User." </p><p> However, the cited provision of the 2016 IRR cannot be made to apply to the subject contracts because at the time of the procurement of the said contracts, the 2009 IRR was the prevailing applicable rule. </p><p> With respect to the OCAt's allegation that the BAC-CS was required to issue a resolution recommending not only the resort to an alternative method of procurement, but the actual awarding of the subject contracts to Ms. Macasaet, it cites a certain Non-Policy Opinion of the GPPB to that effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> However, it bears stressing that such a stand fails to find any legal support under R.A. 9184 and its IRR. </p><p> To restate, there is absolutely no provision under R.A. 9184 and its 2009 IRR which requires or otherwise compels the BAC to recommend the actual awarding of the contract when a Negotiated Procurement is pursued by the Procuring Entity. </p><p> While R.A. 9184 identifies the recommendation of the awarding of contracts to the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative as a function of the BAC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> such provision is read together with the applicable provision on the awarding of contracts under Section 37 of R.A. 9184, which states that: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 37. <em>Notice and Execution of Award</em>. - Within a period not exceeding fifteen (15) calendar days from the <strong>determination and declaration by the BAC of the</strong> <b><u>Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid or Highest Rated Responsive Bid</u></b><strong>, and the recommendation of the award</strong>, the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative shall approve or disapprove the said recommendation. In case of approval, the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative shall immediately issue the Notice of Award to the bidder with the Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid or Highest Rated Responsive Bid. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> <b><u>It is clear from this provision that the requirement of the BAC recommendation of awarding contracts applies only to procurement involving bidding and not to Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants</u></b>. In fact, it is significant to note that even in the list of procedures for Negotiated Procurement under the Manual of Procedures, there is no requirement for the BAC to recommend the awarding of the contract, aside from recommending the resort to an alternative mode of procurement. </p><p> While the OCAt Report cited a certain GPPB Non-Policy Opinion on the BAC's function of recommending awards that were subject to Negotiated Procurement, it must be noted that such opinion is inconsistent with, if not totally opposite to other GPPB opinions. In GPPB Non-Policy Matter (NPM) 068-2004, the GPPB held that: </p><blockquote> <p> Under Section 12.1 of the IRR-A of R.A. 9184, one of the responsibilities entrusted to the BAC is to recommend the award of contracts to the head of the procuring entity or his duly authorized representative. <b><u>However, this responsibility is performed by the BAC in cases where the agency procures through competitive bidding or under the alternative methods of procurement where public bidding procedures are required to be adopted</u></b>, such as Limited Source Bidding under Section 49 of the IRR-A of R.A. 9184, and Negotiated Procurement under Section 53 (a) and (b) of the same rules. </p> <p> <b><u>On the other hand, with respect to those alternative methods of procurement where the public bidding procedures are not mandated to be undertaken</u></b>, such as, Direct Contracting, Repeat Order and Shopping, under Sections 50, 51 and 52 of the IRR-A of R.A. 9184, respectively, <b><u>there is no need for the BAC to perform such function</u></b>. x x x.

Further, the said provision requires the Head of the Procuring Entity or his duly authorized representative to immediately issue the Notice of Award to the <u>bidder with the Lowest Calculated Responsive Bid or Highest Rated Responsive Bid</u>. Furthermore, within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the Notice of Award, the law refers to the <u>winning bidder</u> formally entering into contract with the Procuring Entity. </p><p> As already explained, under R.A. 9184, the concept of bidding is divergent from the concept of procurement under Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants where, instead of undergoing a bidding procedure wherein interested parties may participate, the Procuring Entity and the consultant directly engage each other in negotiation, owing to the highly technical nature of the contact, as well as the factor of trust and confidence involved. Moreover, it must be reiterated that Section 5(d) of R.A. 9184 defines a <b>bid</b> as a signed offer or proposal submitted by a supplier, manufacturer, distributor, contractor or consultant <b><u>in response to the Bidding Documents</u></b>. </p><p> As acknowledged by the OCAt Report itself, the procurement of the subject contracts, as it involves Negotiated Procurement of a Highly Technical Consultant, is <b><u>a "special case" wherein the "tender of the usual bid documents" is "done away" with</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Consequently, it is admitted that the concept of a bid does not apply as regards the subject contracts which were procured <i><u>via</u></i> Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants. </p><p> <b><u>Hence, the foregoing provision on the issuance of a Notice of Award and, corollarily, the posting requirement under the 2009 IRR, should not be applied with respect to the Negotiated Procurement of Highly Technical Consultants, which obviates any semblance of competitive or public bidding</u>. </b></p><p> A statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible. In short, every meaning to be given to each word or phrase must be ascertained from the context of the body of the statute since a word or phrase in a statute is always used in association with other words or phrases and its meaning may be modified or restricted by the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup></p><p> Thus, in order to harmonize the 2009 IRR requirement of public posting of Notices of Award with the provision on when a Notice of Award is required under R.A. 9184, the rule should be construed to mean that the BAC is required to post, for information purposes, the notice of award in the PhilGEPS website, the website of the Procuring Entity concerned, and at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the Procuring Entity in instances involving <b>Competitive Bidding <u>and alternative methods of procurement which entail Competitive Bidding or a semblance thereof</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> </p><p> Such interpretation is more in harmony, not only with R.A. 9184 itself, but also with the Manual of Procedures.

It observed that Section 4.1 of the subject contracts expressly excluded the reimbursable "travel" and "accommodation" costs from her consultancy fees of P600,000.00 and P1,500,000.00, respectively. The OCAt thus concludes that the contractual provisions which exclude the reimbursable travel and accommodation fees from the consultancy fees violate Section 61, 61.1 and Annex F of the Revised IRR of R.A. 9184 pertaining to fixed price consultancy contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> </p> <p> However, contrary to the OCAt's findings, the Manual of Procedures, which was allegedly violated because of the exclusion of reimbursable costs from the consultancy fees, in fact provides that the reimbursement of accommodation and transportation expenses <em>actually spent</em> by a technical consultant does not result in violation of the rule on fixed-price contract. It states that "the cost of a consultancy shall consist of [remuneration and<strong> reimbursable costs, which can either be based on agreed fixed rates or actual costs</strong>]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> <strong>and shall be presented in the agreement in the like manner.</strong>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Thus, it allows payment of reimbursable expenses based on actual cost and not on fixed rate as part of the contract price as long as this arrangement is put in writing and forms part of the contract with the consultant.

Ocampo in his Comment, comparing the scope of Ms. Macasaet's contract with the scope of the two P1.8 million contracts awarded or about to be awarded to the firm, the two consultancy contracts were actually more expensive, considering that each firm had only one deliverable under the contract: the review of one specific project TOR. In contrast, by the time the consultancy of Ms. Macasaet ended in November 2017, she had submitted 18 project TORs. Even assuming that these were her only deliverables and the TORs are divided with the total fees she would have received under the contracts (<i>i.e</i>., P11.1 million), then each project TOR would roughly cost P617,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Thus, the 2012 consultancies cost 300% more per TOR compared to what was paid to Ms. Macasaet, assuming that her total fees are divided by the 18 TORs that she produced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> </p><p> Finally, the rate of P250,000.00 per month was also lower than Ms. Macasaet's going rate based on her salary history, which is one of the factors considered in determining the cost of consultancy under the Manual of Procedures.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> According to Ms. Macasaet, she was paid almost P1 million per month as GSIS-CIO consultant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> She received P500,000.00 as consulting center director at James Martin &amp; Co., exclusive of car plan, gas allowance, communication allowance and other allowances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> As President and COO of MISNet, she also received a monthly salary of P500,000.00 plus allowances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> </p><p> In addition, not only did Ms. Macasaet agree to a rate lower than her previous consulting fees and salaries, but she also resigned as President of her company, Pentathlon Systems Resources Inc., and discontinued providing consultancies to other clients in order to avoid conflict of interest, especially when the projects she helped develop for the Court reached the procurement stage where private IT companies were expected to participate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> Based on the records, these factors were among those considered in evaluating Ms. Macasaet's consultancy fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the <em>ponencia </em>is evidently mistaken in agreeing with the OCAt's finding that there was no proper market research conducted for the prevailing market rates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%"><strong>ii.</strong></td> <td width="84%"><div align="justify"><b><em><strong>There was no violation of the ceiling provided in DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11</strong></em></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The OCAt Report also stated that the proposed consultancy fee of Ms. Macasaet should have been subjected to the ceiling of compensation provided under DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> </p><p> Under paragraphs 3 and 4 of DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11 on the subject of <em>Compensation of Contractual Personnel and Individual Professional Consultants</em>, the ceiling for remuneration is fixed at 120% of the minimum basic salary of his equivalent position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> Upon this premise, the OCAt adopted the basic monthly salary of the MISO Chief (i.e., P73,099.00) in view of the latter's classification as highly technical and policy-determining.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> After considering the MISO Chief as a comparable position, the OCAt then concludes that the maximum limit of the compensation of the consultant should have been P87,718.80, which was exceeded by the subject contracts covering the period of 2013-2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> </p><p> I strongly disagree. </p><p> It is noteworthy that DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11 was issued almost three (3) years before the effectivity date of R.A. 9184, which was the basis for the procurement of Ms. Macasaet's Consultancy. <b><u>The OCAt should not have relied on DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11 since it was no longer in line with R.A. 9184, which became effective in 2003, as well as the Procurement Manual on Consulting Services issued under Section 6 of R.A.

No. 9184. <b><u>Needless to say, the DBM itself acknowledged that it is not DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11 which governs the determination of the cost of consultancy, rather it is governed by R.A. 9184, its IRR, and the Manual of Procedures</u></b>. </p><p> In this connection, it should be emphasized that R.A. 9184 took effect on January 23, 2003, its IRR on September 2, 2009,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> and the Manual on Consulting Services in January 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> Evidently, the OCAt was incorrect in implying that it was DBM Circular Letter No. 2017-9 which gave effect to the abovementioned rules. <b><u>These rules did not become valid only in 2017, but on the respective dates of their effectivity as provided by law</u></b>. Therefore, contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>'s holding,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> even before the express revocation of DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11, the guidelines provided for in the Manual of Procedures were already applicable to the consultancy agreements with Ms. Macasaet. </p><p> As for ceilings, the 20% premium used by the OCAt to say that the compensation for the subject contracts are unreasonable had been recognized as only applicable to payment of services under job order, thus: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify"><b>9.0</b></div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify"><b> Payment of Services under Job Order</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Individuals hired through job order shall be paid wages equivalent to the daily wage/salary of comparable positions in government and <b><i>a premium of up to 20% of such wage/salary.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">The payment of services shall be charged against the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses in the approved agency budget.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Specifically, for individual contracts of service, as the subject contracts, Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 provides: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify"><strong>8.0</strong></div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify"><b>Payment of Services under Individual Contract of Service</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Individuals hired through contract of service shall be paid the <b><i><u>prevailing market rates</u></i></b>, subject to the provisions of RA 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">The payment of services shall be charged against the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses in the approved agency budget.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Individuals hired through contract of service have the option to enroll themselves in social benefit programs thru the SSS, PhilHealth and PAG-IBIG Fund as self-employed members. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Thus, it was erroneous for the OCAt to apply the 20% premium requirement to the subject contracts. </p> <p> It is the OCAt's assertion that the COA used "market rate" as standard for determining the reasonableness of consultancy fees for the first time only in 2017 by virtue of DBM-CSC-COA Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup></p><p> However, such assertion is belied by the fact that <b><u>as early as 2012, the COA had already recognized the use of market rates instead of the 120% ceiling imposed by DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11</u></b>. Moreover, the COA uses the following earlier issuances as bases for auditing government transactions: the procurement law (2003), the Manual of Procedures (2006) and the 2012 Updated Guidelines for the Prevention and Disallowance of Irregular, Unnecessary, Excessive, Extravagant and Unconscionable (IUEEU) Expenditures (Guidelines for IUEEU Expenditures) (2012).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> </p><p> To further bolster this fact, it is important to note that the Guidelines for IUEEU Expenditures does not in any way mention the 120% ceiling in DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11 as a ground to invalidate government transactions. On the contrary, consistent with R.A. 9184 and its Manual of Procedure, it uses the "current and prevailing market value" as a guidepost to determine whether an expenditure is unconscionable. </p><p> Hence, contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>'s holding,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> it was not only Joint Circular No. 1, s. 2017 which provided that the prevailing market rates should apply for individual professional consultants. <b>The use of "market rate" as the standard for determining the reasonableness of consultancy fees was already applicable <i>prior to</i> the issuance of said Joint Circular in 2017.</b> </p><p> In any case, even assuming that the appropriate ceiling remains to be that set forth in the 2000 DBM Circular, it does not appear that there exists an equivalent position to which the 120% compensation ceiling can be attached. </p><p> In the <i>ponencia</i>, it was held that the position of MISO Chief in the SC is equivalent to the position of Ms. Macasaet under the Contracts of Services. Thus, the remuneration of Ms. Macasaet should not be more than 120% of the basic minimum monthly salary of the MISO Chief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> </p><p> However, it should be emphasized that the position of Ms. Macasaet as an ICT consultant is in no way equivalent to the position of the MISO Chief. The qualifications of Ms. Macasaet as an ICT consultant and that of the MISO Chief, as well as the scope of their work, are entirely different. Stated simply, it is obvious that there exists no equivalent position for the same. </p><p> In this connection, the work performed by Ms. Macasaet was not merely to oversee or overview the implementation of the Updated EISP. A perusal of her accomplishment reports per contract would reveal that she did not only perform general IT consultancy which could have been done by the MISO Chief. </p><p> Hence, the OCAt's conclusion that Ms. Macasaet's compensation is unreasonable based on the assumption that the basic salary of the MISO Chief is the appropriate government sector benchmark as "equivalent position" plainly rests upon wrong premises. </p><p> <b>As discussed earlier, the scope of work of the ICT Consultant is sufficiently distinct from the functions of the MISO Chief.</b> The work of the MISO Chief is general in scope, while Ms. Macasaet's work is specific to the development and implementation of the EISP. Moreover, it bears reiterating anew that the EISP encompasses not merely the ICT system of the Court alone; it involves the development of the complex IT framework and other computerization projects covering the <i>entire judiciary</i>. To illustrate, the integrated automation program under the EISP encompasses more than 3,500 trial court locations and stands to benefit more than 30,000 court employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> This is in stark contrast with the mandate of the MISO<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> which is limited to providing technological services and managing the computerized monitoring system installed in <i>Supreme Court alone</i>. The review of the IT framework of the entire judiciary is clearly beyond the scope of the MISO's functions. </p><p> Additionally, it should be stressed once more that since the EISP encompasses the IT initiatives of the entire judiciary, its review necessarily includes an evaluation of the projects and initiatives of the MISO. Thus, the MISO cannot possibly be tasked to assess and evaluate its own IT projects. Indeed, an independent, highly technical consultant is better equipped to ensure the development of an improved IT system for the judiciary. </p><p> Finally, it bears reiterating that, along with Atty. Ocampo, it was Mr. Davis, then Acting Chief of the MISO, who recommended Ms. Macasaet to be the consultant for the Updated EISP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> Verily, the MISO itself recognized the need to hire a consultant for such undertaking. </p><p> <b><u>Considering the level of expertise and the magnitude and scope of work required for the review and implementation of the EISP, it is clear that the consultancy position of Ms. Macasaet is the first of its kind and has no equivalent post in the Court</u></b>. </p><p> As important, it should be emphasized that R.A. 9184 itself recognizes that the need for consulting services arises precisely from the lack of capacity or capability of the government or its organic personnel to undertake: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 5. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. - For purposes of this Act, the following terms or words and phrases shall mean or be understood as follows: </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (f) <i>Consulting Services</i> - refer to services for Infrastructure Projects and other types of projects or activities of the Government requiring adequate <b>external technical and professional expertise that are beyond the capability and/or capacity of the government to undertake</b> such as, but not limited to: (i) advisory and review services; (ii) pre-investment or feasibility studies; (iii) design; (iv) construction supervision; (v) management and related services; and (vi) other technical services or special studies. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, therefore, given the inapplicability of DBM Circular Letter No. 2000-11 as the measure for the determination of the compensation of the individual professional consultant, the <i>ponencia</i> gravely erred when it ruled that the fees were unreasonable. I maintain that there is no cogent reason for the Court to declare the subject contracts void on the basis of unreasonableness of the fees. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%"><strong>VI.</strong></td> <td colspan="2"><em><strong> On the Infirmities regarding the CAF:</strong></em></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="88%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><strong>A.</strong></div></td> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><em><strong>There was no insufficiency of the CAFs pertaining to the 1<em><sup>st</sup></em> and 2<em><sup>nd</sup></em> Contracts due to non-inclusion of reimbursable travel and accommodation costs</strong></em></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>There is no dispute as to the existence of the CAFs for the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Contracts of Services of Ms. Macasaet, which the OCAt Report itself acknowledged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> Moreover, the issue as to the reimbursable travel and accommodation costs has already been discussed above.

In contrast, the provisions on alternative modes of procurement are silent as regards the CAF. The same distinction appears in the 2009 Revised IRR and the Manual of Procedures. Accordingly, the PPC was not required to issue a CAF for procurements using an alternative mode of procurement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> </p><p> Nevertheless, Atty.

The certificate signed by the proper accounting official and the auditor who verified it, shall be <b>attached to and become an integral part of the proposed contract</b>, and the sum so certified shall not thereafter be available for expenditure for any other purpose until the obligation of the government agency concerned under the contract is fully extinguished. </p> <p> SECTION 87. <i>Void Contract and Liability of Officer</i>. — Any contract entered into contrary to the requirements of the two immediately preceding sections shall be <b>void</b>, and the <b>officer or officers entering into the contract shall be liable to the government or other contracting party </b>for any consequent damage to the same extent as if the transaction had been wholly between private parties. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The same provisions also appear in the <b>Administrative Code</b>, specifically in Sections 46, 47, and 48, Chapter 8, Subtitle B, Title I, of Book V. In addition, the Administrative Code also contains the following provision in Book VI, Chapter 5: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 40. <b><i><u>Certification of Availability of Funds. </u></i></b> — <b>No funds shall be disbursed, and no expenditures or obligations chargeable against any authorized allotment shall be incurred or authorized</b> in any department, office or agency <b>without first securing the certification of its Chief Accountant</b> or head of accounting unit as to the availability of funds and the allotment to which the expenditure or obligation may be properly charged. </p> <p> No obligation shall be certified to accounts payable unless the obligation is founded on a valid claim that is properly supported by sufficient evidence and unless there is proper authority for its incurrence.

Since it is clear that these are <b><u>distinct</u></b> certificates required by law, they should be treated separately in relation to the matter at hand. </p><p> In its Report, the OCAt did not raise any issue regarding the <b><u>Certificate Showing Appropriation</u></b> and consequently, the other parties were not apprised of the same. Accordingly, the <i>ponencia</i> should not have delved into the matter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> as it was unfair to the court officials involved who are not able to present any evidence as regards this issue. </p><p>In any case, <b>the existence of the actual appropriation to cover the fees of Ms. Macasaet under the Court's budget is not disputed</b>. As stated in Atty. Ocampo's Comment, there were available appropriations in the Supreme Court budget to fund the consultancy fees of the IT consultant for the years 2014-2017 (the period covering the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> Contracts). He attached a certification issued by the FMBO which shows that the fees paid to Ms. Macasaet were charged against the budget line item of "Professional Services" under the Court's Maintenance and Other Operating Expenditures (MOOE) budget. Specifically, the following amounts were appropriated in the Supreme Court for the said budget line item: P28.52 million for 2014; P28.52 million for 2015; P267.42 million for 2016, and P267.42 million for 2017. Hence, there was sufficient money appropriated to cover the consultancy fees, which is P1.5 million per contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> </p><div align="justify"> <p> As regards the <b><u>CAF</u></b>, the OCAt Report found that there were no CAFs issued for the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> Contracts. This was belied by Atty. Ocampo, however, who claimed that the availability of funds had been certified in various financial documents. </p><p> It is undisputed that there were CAFs issued by the FMBO Budget Division prior to the execution of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Contracts. The CAF dated September 2, 2013 states: </p><blockquote> <p> This is to certify that the amount of <strong>SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND Pesos (P600,000.00)</strong>, inclusive of applicable taxes, will be made available for the payment of a consultancy contract agreement for a period of six (6) months for the Review of the Implementation and Update of the [EISP] and Related ICT Projects of the Judiciary. The amount will be charged against the regular budget of the Supreme Court allotted for the purpose under the General Appropriations Act on the year the expense is incurred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> As for the 2<sup>nd </sup>Contract, the CAF dated May 9, 2014 states: </p><blockquote> <p> This is to certify that the amount of <strong>ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND Pesos (P1,500,000.00)</strong> will be made available to cover the consultancy fee for the Consultancy Agreement, in connection with the Implementation of the Updated [EISP] of the Judiciary. The amount will be charged against the regular budget of the Supreme Court allotted for the purpose under the General Appropriations Act on the year the expense is incurred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> As found by the OCAt, no similar certification had been issued prior to entering into the 3rd to 8th Contracts. <b><i><u>However</u></i>, this does not necessarily mean that there is non-compliance</b> with Section 40, Chapter 5 of the Administrative Code <strong>on the CAF requirement</strong>. </p><p> To recall, the provision on CAF requires that "[n]o funds shall be disbursed, and no expenditures or obligations chargeable against any authorized allotment shall be incurred or authorized in any department, office or agency without first securing the certification of its Chief Accountant or head of accounting unit as to the availability of funds and the allotment to which the expenditure or obligation may be properly charged." Two things are apparent: <i><u>first</u></i>, there is <strong>no particular form required</strong> to be followed for the issuance of the CAF; and <i><u>second</u></i>, unlike the Certificate Showing Appropriation which is required to be issued before entering into the contract, no such requirement appears regarding the CAF. On the contrary, a plain reading of Section 40 readily reveals that the certification by the chief accountant as to availability of funds must be <b>done <i>before funds are disbursed</i> and <i>expenditures or obligations</i> chargeable against authorized allotments <i>are incurred or authorized</i>.</b> </p><p> Based on these premises, it appears that the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 8<sup>th</sup> Contracts duly complied with the CAF requirement. Below are the pertinent statements made by Atty. Ocampo: </p><blockquote> <p> 60. Third, the OCAT report failed to state that <strong>every monthly payment to Ms. Macasaet is covered by an <u>Obligation Request</u>, a form that has a certification from the Supreme Court budget officer on the availability of funds. Each monthly payment is also supported by a <u>Disbursement Voucher</u>, where the Supreme Court chief accountant likewise certifies the availability of the funds for the consultancy fees.</strong> (See Annexes S and T for the Obligation Request and Disbursement Voucher covering the August 24 to September 23 monthly fee of Ms. Macasaet. The same forms are used in all other monthly payments.) All other alternative modes of procurement such as shopping, small value procurement, and procurement through the Procurement Service are also certified in the same manner (see sample Obligation Request and Disbursement Voucher attached as Annexes U and V). </p> <p> 61. As a final point, <b>before any payment was made to Ms. Macasaet, the [OCJ] and the [MISO] certified</b> that the deliverables under her contract had been submitted and attached supporting documents. The certification and supporting documents <strong>then passed through the [OAS], and the finance, budget, and accounting and divisions of the FMBO, and then through the Internal Audit Division.</strong> (See Annex W for the Action Flow Slip for Payment.) The offices, which are in charge of ensuring our compliance with all accounting and auditing rules and are better versed with auditing and accounting guidelines compared to OCAT, <strong>did not find any irregularity in the Ms. Macasaet's contracts and renewals.</strong> No payment[s] were withheld because all required documentation were available to support the payments. All of our financial and auditing units had to do due diligence to ensure that no post-audit findings would be raised by the Commission on Audit. Indeed, 5 years hence since the first contract of Ms. Macasaet was executed, <strong>the COA has yet to issue any adverse observation or notice of disallowance against any of the payments made to Ms. Macasaet on the grounds cited by OCAT</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Nonetheless, the <em>ponencia</em> is of the position that the certification required by law cannot be replaced by mere Obligation Requests and Disbursement Vouchers as they serve different purposes from that of a CAF which certifies that there are funds actually appropriated for the contract to be executed and that such funds are actually available to be expended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup> </p><p> However, as mentioned earlier, the law does not require a specific form for the CAF.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Hence, the IRR itself specifically mandates that contracts for highly technical, primarily confidential or policy determining consultants be limited to a six-month term. This allows the end-user to evaluate every six months whether there is a further need for the consultant's service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> </p> <p> This is consistent with the GPPB clarification as to the meaning of splitting of contracts in GPPB NPM 136-2014 issued on December 6, 2014, which states: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>Clarification on the interpretation the term splitting of contracts under Section 53.1 of the IRR of RA 9184. </b></p> <p> [I]t does not follow that once a contract is divided into smaller quantities or phases, there is splitting of contract. In order to determine whether the division of the procurement project into two (2) packages amounts to splitting of contract, <strong>it must be clearly shown that the act must have been done for the purpose of circumventing or evading legal and procedural requirements</strong>, i.e., there should be a determination that, despite resorting to public bidding for both packages, the division into two (2) packages was done to circumvent or evade the legal and procedural requirements under RA 9184 and its IRR. (Additional emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Clearly, the renewal of the subject contracts cannot be described as prohibited splitting because there is no showing that the repeated renewals were done to circumvent or evade the legal and procedural requirements under RA. 9184. <b><u>In fact, given that the appropriate modality for the services required is direct negotiation, the Court as the Procuring Entity had no other choice but to enter into the subject contracts with terms not longer than six months as provided under Section 53.7 of the 2009 IRR</u></b>. </p><p> <i>Second,</i> while another consultant could have been engaged for a longer period, there is no law, rule, or regulation that mandates such course of action. Indeed, it is up to the end-user to determine the necessity and wisdom of a particular mode of consultancy. <b><u>The OCAt has absolutely no technical expertise to determine whether one mode of procurement is better than another.</u></b> Moreover, the OCAt did not cite any basis to support its conclusion that hiring a consultant for a six-month term is "disadvantageous to the government"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> compared to hiring a consultant for a five (5)-year period. </p><p> In fact, it may actually be argued that it is even more disadvantageous to the government to change or hire another consultant midstream. If a new consultant was hired in the middle of the project, he or she would have to spend a lot of time understanding and learning what had already been done. This would be a waste of time and money, as compared to merely renewing the contract of Ms. Macasaet who was undeniably already very familiar with the project. </p><p> As pointed out by Atty. Ocampo, many of the project TORs submitted by Ms. Macasaet included provisions for the training of Supreme Court IT personnel to ensure that knowledge transfer occurred, which would increase internal technical capacity and enable the IT personnel to develop, implement and maintain IT projects, without the need for an external consultant like Ms. Macasaet. The training provisions are found in the TORs of the following IT projects: (i) Hearing Management System; (ii) Judiciary Email System; (iii) Judiciary Portal; (iv) ePHILJA System; (v) Enterprise Resource Planning System; (vi) Digitization of Court Records; (vii) Disaster Recovery Data Center; (viii) Legal Resource Management System; (ix) Systems Integration Services (Phase 1); (x) Systems Integration Services (Phase 2); (xi) Judiciary Data Center Upgrade (Phase 1); (xii) Judiciary Infrastructure Upgrade (Phase 2); and (xiii) Regional Data Centers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> Based on this, it is quite obvious that a change of consultant cannot be done midstream because it would require extensive training over a long period of time to become familiar with the current projects given their very technical and complex nature. </p><p> <i>Lastly</i>, an examination of the nature of the deliverables involved in the subject contracts shows that the prohibition against splitting of government contracts cited by the OCAt does not apply, as the EISP is implemented in delineated phases. </p><p> Hence, there is no reason for the subject contracts to be declared null and void on the allegation that the continuous renewal and/or extension of the subject contracts every after six months purportedly amounted to splitting of contracts. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"> <div align="justify"><b>VIII.</b></div></div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify"><b><i>The Chief Administrative Officer has the authority to sign the subject contracts</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>With respect to the signing authority of Atty.

For all intents and purposes, the OCAt referred to the Chief Justice as the Head of the Procuring Entity, not the Supreme Court <em>en banc.</em> </p><p> <strong>More importantly, it should be stressed that during the duration of the eight contracts from 2013 to 2017</strong>, <b><u>the Supreme Court <em>en banc</em> itself did not raise any objection on the matter</u></b>. To elaborate, for her first Contract of Service (October 1, 2013 to March 30, 2014) with the Court, Ms. Macasaet was tasked to review the implementation and update of the EISP and related ICT projects of the judiciary. As part of the final report for her first contract, Ms. Macasaet submitted <u>a revised 5-year work plan and budget for the EISP, which became the Updated EISP</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> In a Resolution dated September 16, 2014 in A.M. No. 14-09-06-SC, <b>the <u>Supreme Court <em>en banc</em> approved</u> the Updated EISP Workplan and Budget</b> for 2014 to 2019. One of the whereas clauses therein stated that "<u>an updated work plan and budget</u> of P3.97 billion — that address the plan's critical gaps outlined above — have been <u>developed after <strong>a technical expert's review</strong> of the implementation of the EISP</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> The technical expert referred to in the Resolution was none other than Ms. Macasaet and the updated work plan was the Updated EISP itself which she had developed under her first contract of service. Evidently, from the very beginning, the Supreme Court<em> en banc</em> was aware that the former Chief Justice, as the Head of the Procuring Entity, gave her authority for the Court to enter into a consultancy contract with Ms. Macasaet, and yet the <em>en banc</em> did not object to the same. This is true as well for the succeeding contracts with Ms. Macasaet. </p><p> Indubitably, for the Court to now claim that it is the Court <em>en banc</em> that is the Head of the Procuring Entity and the former Chief Justice was not authorized to enter into the subject contracts — after its silence for the entire duration of the contracts and after the consultant had already completed the services required of her — goes against the principles of fairness and equity. </p><p> In support of this position, the <em>ponencia</em> cited A.M.

Candelaria explained that the former Chief Justice, as Head of the Procuring Entity, already approved the award of the subject contracts to Ms. Macasaet and that the said contracts were already prepared by the OCJ indicating the Deputy Clerk of Court and the Chief Administrative Office as the Court's representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> If this is not an implied authority and designation to act as a signatory for and in behalf of the Court, then what is?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> </p><p> More importantly, aside from the abovementioned implied authority and designation to act as signatory, it is undisputed that she was also given the written authority required by law. An action slip was issued to Atty. Candelaria by Atty. Ocampo of the OCJ stating that the former Chief Justice is authorizing Atty. Candelaria to sign the contract of services of Ms. Macasaet, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> I am pleased to furnish your office a copy of the Contract of Services between the Supreme Court and Ms. Helen Macasaet. </p> <p> <b>A<u>lso attached for your reference is the authorization from the Chief Justice to execute the said Contract of Services</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Despite the obvious, the <em>ponencia</em> posits that said action slip issued by Atty. Ocampo cannot be considered as "proof that full written authority was issued by the Head of the Procuring Entity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> The <em>ponencia</em> further states that the action slip merely stated that an authorization from the former Chief Justice was attached to it, "without expressly stating what the attachment was".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> However, contrary to this, it is evident from the above-quoted action slip that the attachment refers to the written authorization issued by the former Chief Justice to "<b><u>execute</u></b> said Contracts of Services", which by plain reading of the first paragraph of the action slip, refers to the Contracts of Services between Ms. Macasaet and the Court. </p><p> Thus, contrary to the finding of the <i>ponencia</i> that Atty. Candelaria was not given the express authority to sign the Contracts of Services with Ms. Macasaet,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> the above-quoted action slip is proof that she was in fact given express written authority by the former Chief Justice to sign and execute the Contracts of Services on the latter's behalf. </p><p> Atty. Candelaria maintained that her act of signing the subject contracts is a valid exercise of her task of acting as signatory thereto for and in behalf of the Court, in which she exercised due diligence and acted within the authority given to her by the former Chief Justice as Head of the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> </p><p> Hence, the <i>ponencia</i> seriously erred when it failed to hold that Atty. Candelaria, in her capacity as Deputy Clerk of Court, is indeed authorized to sign the subject contracts. As the Chief Administrative Officer of the Court, there is no question that she may be authorized to sign documents on behalf of the Court or the Chief Justice. Moreover, she was expressly authorized by the former Chief Justice, as Head of the Procuring Entity, to sign the subject contracts on her behalf. Therefore, there is no reason to declare the subject contracts null and void on the ground that there was lack of authority on the part of the signing officer. </p><p> <b><i>The Contracts of Services are valid</i></b></p><p> <strong>In sum</strong>, a careful examination of the records of the instant case, as well as a thorough review of the applicable laws, rules, and regulations, would show that, contrary to the findings of the OCAt Report and the <em>ponencia</em>, the subject contracts are indeed valid. </p><p> These contracts were sufficiently covered by APPs as required under R.A. 9184. The procurement of the subject contracts also followed the requirements under R.A. 9184, its IRR, and the Manual of Procedures regarding the level of participation undertaken by the BAC-CS in the Negotiated Procurement process, and with respect to the other applicable procedural and documentary requirements. </p><p> Further, there are no infirmities regarding the consultancy fees granted to Ms. Macasaet. The requirement of issuing CAFs had also been sufficiently met. Moreover, there was no splitting of contracts extant in the instant case. Finally, there is no doubt that the Chief Administrative Officer had the authority to sign the subject contracts on behalf of the Court. </p><p> <b><i>A Final Note</i></b></p><p> Through the resolution of the instant matter, the Court has strayed away from the trail of justice and instead moved towards the path of unfairness. </p><p> The beginning of this matter was less than ideal. To put things into perspective, recall that this administrative matter was initially part of a letter-request for certified true copies of certain documents in connection with the filing of an impeachment complaint against the former Chief Justice. The Court referred the determination of the legality of the subject contracts to the OCAt. Subsequently, the OCAt submitted its Report which recommended that the subject contracts be declared void. </p><p> Notably, despite grave findings of liability, the OCAt Report was made without <em>any</em> comment from the parties involved — including Ms. Macasaet, the person who stands to be most affected by any ruling on the matter. While the parties were subsequently ordered by the Court to file their comments, these were submitted already after the fact — that is, they were not considered at all by the OCAt Report. </p><p> Moreover, it appears that the person who initially requested for certain documents in view of the filing of an impeachment complaint had already filed several cases against court officials involving the subject contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> The grounds he cited were among the grounds used in the OCAt Report in finding the subject contracts void. </p><p> Even beyond the actual and possible charges that may be brought against Court officials, this matter also affects one of the major projects of the Court, <i>i.e.</i>, the EISP. </p><p> These factors should have alerted the Court to be more judicious in resolving this matter. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Contrary to the dictates of prudence, the Court made a declaration of nullity of the contracts on the basis of a mere request for documents and a report made without first hearing the parties involved. </p><p> The unfairness is most palpably demonstrated in its order for Ms. Macasaet to return the entire amount she had received as consultancy fees from all eight contracts of services, which amount to P11,100,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup> Even the OCAt Report recommended that despite the nullity of the contracts, payments for Ms. Macasaet's services must still be made on the basis of <i>quantum meruit</i> considering that she completely delivered the services required for the contracts involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> Regrettably, the Court did not heed such recommendation. The Court did not even take into consideration that Ms. Macasaet was the only non-lawyer among the key parties in this matter and that most likely, she had to rely on the officials she was dealing with, who were from no less than the Supreme Court and the Office of the Chief Justice. </p><p> For the Court now to deny Ms. Macasaet payment for the services she had rendered for the EISP and other ICT projects — which, in fact, the Court has benefited and continues to benefit from — is the height of injustice. I commiserate with Ms. Macasaet on the following statements she made in her Comment: </p><blockquote> <p> 16. Due to my limited personal knowledge of and participation in the procurement process of my ICT consultancy projects, and not being a legal professional, I am not competent to render a legal opinion on the validity of my eight (8) Contracts of Services. </p> <p> 17. Nevertheless, I must stress that I was made to believe, and I still believe, in all good faith that my eight (8) Contracts of Services are valid and lawful. After all, I contracted with no less than the Highest Court of the land, and I dealt with several lawyers and magistrates. It is my belief and understanding that they carefully drafted, studied and reviewed the contracts, and made sure that they are valid and legal. I had no reason to believe that x x x they did not act in good faith, and in the best interest of the government and the public at large. Also, I presumed that those who drafted, studied and reviewed the contracts performed their duties in a regular manner. </p> <p> 18. Assuming for argument's sake that my eight (8) Contracts of Services are void and unlawful and that I should be compensated therefor based on the principle of <i>quantum meruit</i>, as the OCAT suggests, there is ample basis in asserting that the compensation I received for the services I rendered is reasonable from the government's perspective even though, from my perspective, such compensation is substantially below market rate. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> 20. Indubitably, I deserve to be recompensed for completing the work for which I was engaged. Significantly, the Report noted that this Honorable Court duly issued Certificates of Completion for the first to seventh Contracts of Services. Since the Report was issued prior to the expiration of the eight[h] Contract of Service on 23 November 2017, it failed to note that this Honorable Court has not issued a Certificate of Completion for the eighth and final Contract of Service, and has not released its final payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Indeed, it is dishonorable for the Court to turn a blind eye to Ms. Macasaet's accomplished work and disregard all her efforts on the EISP and other ICT projects of the Court. She had rendered services to the Court from 2013 to 2017. How can the Court, within the bounds of fair play, order her to return what she had received for services she had already rendered in the span of four years? For the Court to reap the fruits of Ms. Macasaet's labor while taking what is due her is, in a word, a disgrace. This is unjust enrichment perpetrated by the highest court of the land. </p><p> The Court is supposed to be a bastion of fairness, justice, and equity.
