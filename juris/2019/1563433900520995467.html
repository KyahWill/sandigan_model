He pointed out that Bernardo initially claimed arriving at <em>Barangay</em> Guindaohan at 10:00 a.m. but later changed it to 10:00 p.m. and that the latter originally stated in his affidavit that Rodolfo was attacked by Arpon and Lanante but eventually declared in open court that he only saw Arpon stab Rodolfo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He also argued that treachery was not present because the victim was not alone at that time but accompanied by his friend and both could have easily subdued the attacker.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Finally, he insisted that the court should have upheld his testimony rather than the contusing and inconsistent testimony of the prosecution eye witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the plaintiff-appellee averred that the RTC did not err in convicting accused-appellant whose guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that no standard behavior can be expected from people who had just witnessed a frightful experience;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> that assuming that there had been inconsistencies in Bernardo's testimony, these only referred to minor details which did not impair his credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Plaintiff-appellee likewise contended that the RTC correctly appreciated the circumstance of treachery considering the time and manner of the attack which clearly indicated that the killing was deliberately and carefully planned to ensure the death of Rodolfo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Finally, it maintained that the RTC did not err in discrediting the defense of alibi in light of accused-appellant's revelation that he was in the vicinity of the crime scene.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> <b><i>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</i></b></p><p> The CA affirmed<em> in toto</em> the ruling of the RTC. It held that Bernardo's failure to immediately inform his and Rodolfo's parents about the incident did not render his testimony undeserving of faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Moreover, the CA held that the inconsistencies, if any, pertained only to collateral matters, and not to the elements of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It concurred with the RTC in giving more credence to the positive identification of the perpetrator by the prosecution witness, who had no ill motive to testify, over the alibi and denial of accused-appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Finally, it declared that treachery attended the commission of the crime in light of the circumstances on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> Hence, the present appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In compliance with the directive to file a supplemental brief, if it so desired,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> plaintiff-appellee submitted a Manifestation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> in which it stated that it would be adopting the Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> submitted earlier before the CA and would be dispensing with the filing of Supplemental Brief before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p> Accused-appellant, through counsel, submitted his Supplemental Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> wherein he insisted that no motive was proven by the prosecution as to why he would attack and kill Rodolfo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> He claimed that this failure to establish motive would make anyone suspect, including Bernardo; hence, possibly the ill motive on the part of Bernardo to fabricate a story and implicate Arpon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> He further claimed that treachery was not present, because Rodolfo was then accompanied by Bernardo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> He finally claimed that Bernardo's testimony was of doubtful veracity because the latter failed to immediately report the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b> Our Ruling</b> </p><p> The appeal has no merit. </p><p> In order to successfully prosecute the crime of murder, the following elements must be established: (a) that a person was killed; (b) the accused killed him or her; (c) the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code (RPC); and (d) the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> Here, the fact that Rodolfo was killed and that accused-appellant killed him were both sufficiently established by the prosecution.

Both Rodolfo and Bernardo were unarmed and were totally unaware of the impending assault from the accused-appellant. </p><p> Accused-appellant's argument that he should be acquitted since the prosecution had not established motive as to why he would attack and kill Rodolfo does not persuade because: </p><blockquote> <p> [m]otive is not an essential element of a crime and hence the prosecution need not prove the same. As a general rule, proof of motive for the commission of the offense charged does not show guilt and absence of proof of such motive does not establish the innocence of [the] accused for the crime charged such as murder. The history of crimes shows that murders are generally committed from motives comparatively trivial. Crime is rarely rational, hi murder, the specific intent is to kill the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Likewise untenable is the accused-appellant's contention that treachery should not have been appreciated to have attended the commission of the crime considering that Rodolfo was then accompanied by Bernardo. In <i>People v. Cagas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court held that treachery was present when accused-appellant stabbed the victim, even if the latter had been talking or conversing with his companion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The Court in said case placed emphasis on the fact that the victim was truly clueless about the fatal attack that was to befall him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The same situation obtains in the case at bar. </p><p> The accused-appellant makes capital of the fact that Bernardo failed to report the incident to the authorities, suggesting the possibility of a prior confrontation between Rodolfo and Arpon - a happenstance that negates treachery. This argument is neither here nor there. </p><p> Case law teaches that - </p><blockquote> <p> Delay in revealing the identity of the perpetrators of a crime does not necessarily impair the credibility of a witness, especially where sufficient explanation is given. No standard form of behavior can be expected from people who had witnessed a strange or frightful experience. Jurisprudence recognizes that witnesses are naturally reluctant to volunteer information about a criminal case or are unwilling to be involved in criminal investigations because of varied reasons. Some fear for their lives and that of their family; while others shy away when those involved in the crime are their relatives or townmates. And where there is delay, it is more important to consider the reason for the delay, which must be sufficient or well-grounded, and not the length of delay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Anent the penalty, no aggravating circumstance other than the qualifying circumstance of treachery having attended the murderous assault, the RTC correctly imposed the penalty of<i> reclusion perpetua</i> which the CA properly affirmed. Nonetheless, the amount of damages must be increased in light of prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
