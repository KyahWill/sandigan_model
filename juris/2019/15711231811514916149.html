Melencio filed applications for free patent as to Lots Nos. 2 and 4, and his applications were eventually approved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Sometime after 1963, Melencio executed an <i>Agreement to Transfer Rights and Deed of Sale </i>and a <i>Quitclaim Deed </i>upon the intervention of Alfonso Non. It turned out, however, that said documents were for the sale of <i>all </i>the subdivided lots to one John Z. Sycip, instead of only the lots covered by the free patent issued to Melencio. As a result, the original certificate of title was delivered to Sycip instead of to Melencio and Talinanap.<br><br>After the subdivision, the disposition of the Makar property — particularly Lot No. 2 — became the subject of controversy in several civil cases, the rulings in which were ultimately brought to the Court, namely: (a) <b>G.R. No. 76487 </b>entitled <i>Heirs of Sycip v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> whose decision was promulgated on November 9, 1990 <b>(1990 Case); </b>(b)<b> G.R.

No. 76487)</b></center><br><br>After discovering that the original certificate of title had been delivered to Sycip, Melencio and Talinanap commenced in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of South Cotabato an action against Sycip for the declaration of nullity of documents and recovery of possession of real property (with a prayer for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction). The action, docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 1291, </b>was assigned to Branch I of the CFI.<br><br>The ruling in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>eventually reached the Court <b>(G.R. No. 76487), </b>and the pivotal question raised was whether or not the sale of Lot No. 2 was null and void <i>ab initio. </i>Through the decision promulgated on November 9, 1990,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Court nullified the <i>Agreement to Transfer Rights and Deed of Sale </i>and the <i>Quitclaim Deed </i>on the ground that with Melencio and Talinanap being native Muslims belonging to the cultural minority or non-Christian Maguindanao tribe, the real property transactions to which they were parties were governed by the pertinent provisions of the <i>Revised Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu, </i>the <i>Public Land Act, </i>and Republic Act No. 3872, laws that respectively required the real property transactions to be approved by the relevant Provincial Governor, the Commissioner of Mindanao and Sulu, and the Chairman of the Commission on National Integration; and that, therefore, the documents were void and inexistent for being falsified, without consideration, and lacking of the requisite approvals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The ruling in the <b>1990 Case (G.R. No. 76487) </b>became final and executory on December 10, 1990, and the entry of judgment was issued on February 2, 1991. As a result, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in General Santos City directed the issuance of the writ of execution in its order dated February 26, 1991.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>As it turned out, Sycip had long abandoned the Makar property since the 1980s. As of the time of the execution of the ruling in <b>Civil Case No. 1291, </b>however, other persons were already occupying Lot No. 2 and had built improvements thereon. Among them were: (1) the group of illegal settlers that had entered the disputed property in the interim, and who had organized themselves into the Yard Urban Homeowners Association, Inc. <b>(YUHAI); </b>(2) another group of illegal entrants who had organized themselves as the Sogod Homeseekers Association, against whom the Heirs of Yu brought an action for forcible entry docketed as Civil Case No. 1668-22;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and (3) the Heirs of Non Andres, represented by Gracelda.<br><br>When the sheriff implemented the writ of execution issued in the <b>1990 Case, </b>the occupants refused to vacate Lot No. 2. Thus, the Heirs of Yu moved for the demolition of the occupants' improvements on Lot No. 2.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the order dated April 26, 1991, the RTC granted this motion and directed "the defendants who have remained in the premises xxx to remove their houses, otherwise, corresponding demolition will automatically follow."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>To prevent the Heirs of Yu from taking over the property where its members had erected their houses, YUHAI filed a complaint for injunction and damages with prayer for writ of preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order (TRO), docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 4647, </b>in the RTC, which was assigned to Branch 23 <b>(YUHAI Injunction Case).</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> By this time, the same RTC branch was hearing both <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>and <b>Civil Case No. 4647, </b>which had been consolidated.<br><br>The RTC dismissed the <b>YUHAI Injunction Case </b>on March 25, 1995, and the CA affirmed the dismissal on August 28, 1998 in CA-G.R. No. 54003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Still unsuccessful in obtaining possession of Lot No. 2, the Heirs of Yu again sought the issuance of a special order of demolition. However, on March 10, 1998, the RTC, then presided by Acting Presiding Judge Monico G. Cabales, denied their motion to that effect,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> observing that the improvements being sought to be demolished had been built by persons not privy to <b>Civil </b>Case <b>No. 1291; </b>and holding that the judgment did not bind persons who were not parties in the action because every person was entitled to due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The RTC later denied the Heirs of Yu's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Undaunted, the Heirs of Yu again moved for the issuance of a writ of demolition. The RTC, now under Presiding Judge Jose S. Majaducon, granted the motion, and issued the special order of demolition dated August 22, 2001 <b>(2001 Demolition Order),</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote><center>SPECIAL ORDER OF DEMOLITION</center><br><br>TO: The Provincial Sheriff of General Santos City or any of his deputies<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREAS, on March 19, 2001, an ORDER was issued by the Court, the dispositive part of which reads as follow (sic):<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the motion to implement the writ of demolition against the defendants and oppositors is hereby GRANTED."<br></blockquote><br>WHEREAS, on June 20, 2001, an ORDER was issued by the Court, reading as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Acting on the Motion for Reconsideration on the Order dated [M]arch 19, 2001, granting motion for a special order of demolition and the opposition thereto, the Court having found no cogent reason to reconsider or set aside the Order, hereby DENIES the motion.<br><br>The Decision of the Court of Appeals is very clear on the issues raised in the motion. Since oppositors have not shown any right to the land, they should vacate the same.

SP No. 69176). Initially, on March 5, 2002, the CA issued a TRO to enjoin the implementation, thereby effectively deferring the demolition for several years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Ultimately, the CA dismissed YUHAI's petition for <i>certiorari </i>and denied YUHAI's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal. Thus, YUHAI appealed the dismissal to this Court, which denied the petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>on September 16, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as the implementation of the <b>2001 Demolition Order</b> remained pending and incomplete, the Heirs of Yu filed their <i>Motion to Resume and Complete Demolition. </i>In its October 9, 2007 order <b>(2007 Resumption Order),</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the RTC (Branch 36) granted the motion and directed the provincial sheriff to proceed with and complete the demolition allowed in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>and <b>Civil Case No. 4647,</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote><div align="center">SPECIAL ORDER TO RESUME AND COMPLETE DEMOLITION<br></div><br>TO: The Provincial Sheriff of General Santos City or any of his deputies<br><br>x x x x<br><br>NOW THEREFORE, we command you to resume and complete the demolition in [Civil Case Nos. 1291 and 4647] <b>as directed in the Special Order of Demolition, dated August 22, 2001, </b>issued by then Judge Jose S.

(Emphasis Supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Subsequently, on November 12, 2007 and December 4, 2007, the sheriff sent notices to <i>all occupants </i>to vacate Lot No. 2.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Two parties assailed the <b>2007 Resumption Order, </b>namely: the Heirs of Non Andres and Azucena N. Bayani.<br><br>Arguing that they were not even parties in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>and <b>Civil Case No. 4647, </b>the Heirs of Non Andres assailed their inclusion in the implementation through their letter addressed to the provincial sheriff whereby they insisted on their exclusion from the implementation, and by filing therein a <i>Special Appearance with Ex-Parte Manifestation and Motion. </i>The provincial sheriff did not act on their letter, while the RTC expressly disallowed their motion through the order dated December 7, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> On December 11, 2007,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> therefore, they brought a petition for <i>certiorari, </i>prohibition, and injunction with prayer for the issuance of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction <b>(CA-G.R. SP No. 02084-MIN) </b>to set aside the <b>2007 Resumption Order </b>and to permanently enjoin the demolition as far as they were concerned.<br><br>On her part, Bayani also went to the CA by commencing an action for indirect contempt against Deputy Sheriff Alfredo Pallanan of Branch 36 of the RTC on the ground that the latter had illegally demolished her house <b>(CA-G.R. SP NO. 02118-MIN).</b><br><br>It is notable that the two petitions filed in the CA to resist the implementation of the <b>2007 Resumption Order </b>paved the way to two cases that separately reached the Court, specifically: (1) <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 02084-MIN </b>involving matters that had occurred in the early stages <i>(i.e., </i>the ancilliary prayer for the issuance of writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the demolition), which led to the <b>2013 Case; </b>and (2) after <b>CA-G.R. SP NO. 02118-MIN </b>was consolidated with <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 02084-MIN, </b>the CA resolved the <i>main issue </i>on the propriety of the <b>2007 Resumption Order </b>through the decision promulgated on May 20, 2011.<br><br>Bayani and the Heirs of Non Andres have separately appealed the decision promulgated on May 20, 2011, and their appeals are now the subjects of the consolidated appeals herein.<br><br><center><b>B. </b><br><b>2013 Case (G.R.

Hence, on April 3, 2008, the CA issued: (1) an order granting their motion for reconsideration; and (2) a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction preventing further demolition on the subject property.<br><br>Confronted by another impending delay in the clearing of the subject lot of the occupants, the Heirs of Yu moved to reconsider and reverse the grant of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, and to dissolve the writ. After their move failed, they came to the Court to seek recourse by petition for <i>certiorari </i><b>(G.R. No. 182371), </b>which is the <b>2013 Case.</b><br><br>The main issue in the <b>2013 Case</b> was whether or not the CA had properly issued the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In striking down the CA's order, the Court opined that the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction had been done in undue haste and without the requisite posting of the bond; that an order granting the preliminary mandatory injunction did not automatically entitle the applicant to an immediate enforcement;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that the CA had committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the Heirs of Non Andres's prayer for preliminary mandatory injunction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> reminding that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [A] preliminary mandatory injunction should only be granted "in cases of extreme urgency; <b>where the right is </b><u><b>very clear</b></u><b>; </b>where considerations of relative inconvenience bear strongly in complainant's favor; <b>where there is a </b><u><b>willful and unlawful invasion of plaintiffs right</b></u> <b>against his protest and remonstrance, the injury being a continuing one; </b>and where the effect of the mandatory injunction is rather to re-establish and maintain a pre-existing continuing relation between the parties, recently and arbitrarily interrupted by the defendant, than to establish a new relation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br><br>and that the Heirs of Non Andres's entitlement to the preliminary mandatory injunction was more doubtful than clear and unmistakable because: (a) the evidence they had presented was weak and inconclusive; (b) the right sought to be protected remained to be disputed;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and (c) the damages allegedly sustained did not consist of grave and irreparable injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The Court pronounced that the Heirs of Non Andres were bound by the ruling in the <b>1990 Case, </b>whereby the <i>Agreement to Transfer Rights and Deed of Sale </i>and <i>Quitclaim Deed </i>were nullified;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that said documents could not prove their ownership and possession of Lot No. 2;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that although they had presented other public documents, such as the application for free patent of their predecessor-in-interest, Concepcion Non Andres, the existence and due execution of such documents had remained inconclusive and highly disputed; and that, consequently, such documents could not be the source of a clear and unmistakable right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Court observed that the parties had continued to disagree on the fact of prior possession of Lot No. 2; that although the Heirs of Non Andres had claimed to be "the actual possessors — open, continuous, and adverse possession in the concept of an owner—and not squatters, of the subject lot for over 50 years," and that they had erected improvements and structures on the lot that would be in danger of being demolished, the CA had nonetheless hastily issued the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction because it had not even ascertained the veracity of the claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the <b>2013 Case, </b>the CA resolved the consolidated petitions in <b>CA-G.R.

More than the lack of identity of parties, however, a careful perusal reveals that such previous rulings of the Court dealt with and resolved issues separate and distinct from the question being now raised herein.<br><br>In the <b>1990 Case, </b>the Court resolved the principal issue of the validity of the sale or transfer from the Spouses Yu to Sycip that had been effected through the <i>Agreement to Transfer Rights and Deed of Sale </i>and <i>Quitclaim Deed. </i>The Court thereby affirmed the CA's decision declaring Melencio and Talinanap "as the registered absolute owners of Lot No. 2," and ordered Sycip to restore the possession to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The focus the <b>2013 Case </b>was the propriety of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the CA as a relief that was preliminary and ancillary to the main case in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 02084-MIN.</b><br><br>In contrast, the petitioners raise in these consolidated appeals the core controversy concerning the propriety of the <b>2007 Resumption Order </b>and its implementation, which was the subject matter of the main case in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 02084-MIN </b>(later on consolidated with <b>CA-G.R. SP NO. 02118-MIN). </b>Indeed, the ruling in the <b>1990 Case </b>affirming the RTC's pronouncement of absolute ownership in favor of Melencio and Talinanap was not conclusive upon the issue raised herein of whether or not the RTC's issuance of the <b>2007 Resumption Order </b>was proper, for the determination of such issue was separable and independent from the issue of ownership.<br><br>Even granting that the issue of ownership of Lot No. 2 was previously resolved in favor of Melencio and Talinanap, such resolution did not prejudice the rights of the Heirs of Non Andres as persons who had not been parties in the main proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The present controversy stems from the implementation against them of the RTC's judgment rendered in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>despite their being strangers in the action. The following circumstances show that, indeed, they were strangers to the action. Firstly, the proceedings in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>– being <i>in personam </i>– were exclusively between the spouses Melencio and Talinanap, on one hand, and Sycip and YUHAI, on the other. The mere mention of Alfonso Non in the <b>1990 Case </b>did not mean that he had participated at the trial, or that he had knowledge of the proceedings, or that he had been duly notified of the case as to bind him to the effects of the judgment therein. Secondly, the character of <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>as an action <i>in personam </i>— being an action for the declaration of nullity of document and recovery of possession of real property—was unquestionable. Such character of the action empowered the court "to render personal judgment or to subject the parties in a particular action to the judgment and other rulings rendered in the action" only when it regularly acquired jurisdiction over the parties. As such, the RTC would acquire jurisdiction over the parties only if they had been properly impleaded and personally served with the summons and copies of the complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>It is equally worthy to note that Rule 39 of the <i>Rules of Court </i>sets the following guidelines to govern the execution of judgments for the delivery or restitution of property, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>SECTION 10. Execution of Judgments for Specific Act. — (a) xxx<br><br>(c) Delivery or Restitution of Real Property. — The officer shall demand of <b>the person against whom the judgment for the delivery or restitution of real property is rendered and all persons claiming rights under him </b>to peaceably vacate the property within three (3) working days, and restore possession thereof to the judgment obligee; otherwise, the officer shall oust all such persons therefrom with the assistance, if necessary, of appropriate peace officers, and employing such means as may be reasonably necessary to retake possession, and place the judgment obligee in possession of such property. Any costs, damages, rents or profits awarded by the judgment shall be satisfied in the same manner as a judgment for money.<br><br>(d) Removal of Improvements on Property Subject of Execution. — When the property subject of the execution contains improvements constructed or planted <b>by the judgment obligor or his agent, </b>the officer shall not destroy, demolish or remove said improvements except upon special order of the court, issued upon motion of the judgment obligee after due hearing and after the former has failed to remove the same within a reasonable time fixed by the court.<br></blockquote><br>Evident from the foregoing is that such guidelines only extend to the judgment obligor or any person claiming rights under him. It is truly doctrinal that the execution of any judgment for a specific act cannot extend to persons who were never parties to the main proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> A court process that forcefully imposes its effects on or against a stranger, even if issued by virtue of a final judgment, certainly offends the constitutional guarantee under Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. As explained in <i>Munoz v. Yabut, Jr.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The rule is that: (1) a judgment <i>in rem </i>is binding upon the whole world, such as a judgment in a land registration case or probate of a will; and (2) <b>a judgment </b><i><b>in personam </b></i><b>is binding upon the parties and their successors-in-interest but not upon strangers. A judgment directing a party to deliver possession of a property to another is </b><i><b>in personam; </b></i><b>it is binding only against the parties and their successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action. An action for declaration of nullity of title and recovery of ownership of real property, or re-conveyance, is a real action but it is an action </b><i><b>in personam, </b></i><b>for it binds a particular individual only although it concerns the right to a tangible thing. </b>Any judgment therein is binding only upon the parties properly impleaded.<br><br><b>Since they were not impleaded as parties and given the opportunity to participate in Civil Case No. Q-28580, the final judgment in said case cannot bind BPI Family and the spouses Chan.</b> The effect of the said judgment cannot be extended to BPI Family and the spouses Chan by simply issuing an alias writ of execution against them. No man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by any judgment rendered by the court. <b>In the same manner, a writ of execution can be issued only against a party and not against one who did not have his day in court. Only real parties in interest in an action are bound by the judgment therein and by writs of execution issued pursuant thereto. </b>(Bold emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Considering that the Spouses Melencio and Talinanap sought to nullify two documents <i>(i.e., </i>the <i>Agreement to Transfer Rights and Deed of Sale </i>and the <i>Quitclaim Deed) </i>to recover Lot No. 2 from Sycip, who was then in possession of the lot's original certificate of title, the judgment rendered thereon was not enforceable against the whole world but only against the defendants thereat <i>(i.e., </i>the Heirs of Sycip).<br><br>The Heirs of Non Andres were not impleaded in <b>Civil Case No. 1291, </b>much less personally served summons therefor, the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over any of them. The execution of the judgment rendered therein could not validly include strangers to the case like the Heirs of Non Andres, for the court did not acquire jurisdiction over them and were consequently not given their day in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><center><b>2. </b><br><b>Sheriff improperly implemented</b><br><b>the 2007 Resumption Order<br>and the 2001 Demolition Order</b></center><br><br>The <b>2007 Resumption Order, </b>as well as the <b>2001 Demolition Order</b> on which it was based, directed the demolition of improvements belonging to the Heirs of Sycip and YUHAI. As earlier shown, the <b>2001 Demolition Order </b>ostensibly disposed thusly:<br><br><blockquote><b>xxxx we command you to demolish the improvements erected by the defendants HEIRS OF JOHN Z. SYCIP xxx, in Civil Case No. 1291, and plaintiffs YARD URBAN HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION INC., ET AL. in Civil Case No. 4647, on that portion of land belonging to plaintiffs in Civil Case 1291 and defendants Civil Case no. 4647, MELENCIO YU and TALINANAP MATUALAGA, covered by Original Certificate of Title [No.] (V-14496) (P-2331) P-523 in Apopong, General Santos City</b></blockquote><br><br>Said orders were issued by virtue of the Heirs of Sycip and YUHAI being the judgment obligors in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>and <b>Civil Case No. 4647, </b>respectively. The situation became problematic only when the sheriffs tasked to implement said orders served the notices to vacate <i>to all the occupants of Lot No. 2 without exception. </i>The notices to vacate thereby <i>deviated </i>from the tenor and text of the assailed orders as to cover even the Heirs of Non Andres although they had not been parties in <b>Civil Case No. 1291 </b>and <b>Civil Case No. 4647. </b>Therein lay the prejudice caused to the Heirs of Non Andres.<br><br>Such exceeding their authority on the part of the sheriffs cannot be permitted or validated. The sheriffs duty to strictly adhere to the mandate of the orders regularly issued by the court for the execution stage of a judgment cannot be arbitrarily ignored or set aside, but must be faithfully discharged and complied with. The sheriff is bereft of the power or discretion to expand the mandate in any way. As pointed out in <i>Stilgrove v. Sabas,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The sheriffs duty to execute a judgment is ministerial. He need not look outside the plain meaning of the writ of execution. And when a sheriff is faced with an ambiguous execution order, prudence and reasonableness dictate that he seek clarification from a judge. <b>However, Sabas took it upon himself to execute the order even if it entails the destruction of a property belonging to a person not a party to the case. By doing so, the sheriff went beyond the terms of the demolition order as it only ordered the demolition to apply only to "defendants x xx as well as all persons claiming rights under them x x x."</b> To reiterate our pronouncement in the previous administrative case, it is of no moment whether Sabas executed the writ in good faith because he is chargeable with the knowledge of what is the proper action to observe in case there are questions in the writ which need to be clarified and to which he is bound to comply. (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>To contest the invalid implementation of the orders by the sheriffs, the Heirs of Non Andres immediately wrote to the latter and also filed their special appearance in the RTC, but their attempt to intervene went for naught. Left with no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available to them in the ordinary course of law, they went to the CA for relief. After having satisfied all the requisites laid down in Section 2, Rule 65 of the <i>Rules of Court, </i>therefore, the Heirs of Non Andres were entitled to the issuance of the writ of <i>certiorari </i>and prohibition.<br><br><div align="center"><blockquote><b>3.</b><br><b>Sheriffs Report enjoyed<br>the presumption of regularity</b></blockquote></div><br><br>We next deal with Bayani's appeal <b>(G.R.

The sheriff thus acted not only erroneously but also outside the bounds of his authority. However, we have to clarify that the charge brought against him for contempt of court based on such circumstances must be properly brought to and heard by the RTC, conformably with the recognized rule that the court against whose authority the contempt is committed has the preferential right to inquire whether any party has disobeyed its order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><center><b>4.</b><br><b>Judge Majaducon could not validly<br>sit as the presiding judge on the case<br>involving the Heirs of Yu, his former clients</b></center><br><br>The Heirs of Non Andres have averred that <b>Judge Majaducon had been Melencio's former counsel prior to his appointment as the Presiding Judge. </b>In substantiation, they presented two correspondences addressed to the members of the Sogod Homeseekers Association that had been signed by one <b>Atty.
