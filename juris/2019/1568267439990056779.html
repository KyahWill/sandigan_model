On June 17, 2013, while on board the vessel en route to France, Tiquio suffered high fever, nausea, and vomiting. Despite medications, his condition worsened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thus, he was sent to an offshore clinic in France on June 28, 2013, where he was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and was recommended for repatriation for proper medical treatrnent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> As a result, Tiquio was medically repatriated on June 29, 2013 and was immediately referred to the Associated Marine Officers' and Seamen's Union of the Philippines Seamen's Hospital, where he was diagnosed by Dr. Jay S.

Additionally, Dr. Fonte reiterated that Tiquio is unfit for work and that his illness is "NOT Work Oriented."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Tiquio filed a complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> on <b>September 1, 2014</b> for disability benefits, reimbursement of medical and hospital expenses, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees.

The CA agreed with the LA that Tiquio suffered a work-related illness on board the vessel, and that the latter had complied with the four (4) requisites provided under Section 32-A<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> of the POEA-SEC, thus, rendering petitioners liable for disability compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioners sought reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> which the CA denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; dated August 30, 2018; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly declared Tiquio to be entitled to total and permanent disability benefits.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, the Court stresses that the review in this Rule 45 petition of the CA's ruling in a labor case via Rule 65 petition filed by Tiquio with that court carries a distinct approach. In a Rule 45 review, the Court examines the correctness of the CA's decision, which is limited to questions of law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA's decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari </i>was presented to the CA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> that is, from the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC's decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, has been defined as the capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, done in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, the character of which being so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, if the NLRC ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare, and accordingly, dismiss the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> With these standards in mind, the Court finds that the CA erroneously ascribed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in dismissing Tiquio's claim for disability benefits.<br><br>It is basic that the entitlement of overseas seafarers to disability benefits is a matter governed, not only by medical findings, but also by law and contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> By law, the pertinent statutory provisions are Articles 197 to 199<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; (formerly Articles 191 to 193) of the Labor Code, as amended,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>&nbsp; in relation to Section 2 (<i>a</i>), Rule X<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; of the Amended Rules on Employees Compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; By contract, material are: (<i>a</i>) the POEA-SEC, which is a standard set of provisions that is deemed incorporated in every seafarer's contract of employment; (<i>b</i>) the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), if any; and (<i>c</i>) the employment agreement between the seafarer and his employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, which is the rule applicable to this case since Tiquio was employed in 2012, governs the procedure for compensation and benefits for a work-related injury or illness suffered by a seafarer on board sea-going vessels during the term of his employment contract, to wit:<br><blockquote>SEC. 20.

Clearly, he failed to comply with the prescribed procedure under the above-cited Section 20 (A) (3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC on the joint appointment by the parties of a third doctor, in case the seafarer's personal doctor disagrees with the CDP's assessment. In the recent case of <i>Gargallo v. Dohle Seafront Crewing (Manila), Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> citing Veritas, the Court reiterated the well-settled rule that the seafarer's non-compliance with the mandated conflict-resolution procedure under the POEA-SEC militates against his claims, and results in the affirmance of the findings and assessment of the company-designated physician, thus:<br><blockquote>The [POEA-SEC] and the CBA clearly provide that when a seafarer sustains a work-related illness or injury while on board the vessel, his fitness or unfitness for work shall be determined by the company-designated physician. If the physician appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the company-designated physician's assessment, the opinion of a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer to be the decision final and binding on them.<br><br>Thus, while petitioner had the right to seek a second and even a third opinion, the final determination of whose decision must prevail must be done in accordance with an agreed procedure. Unfortunately, the petitioner did not avail of this procedure; hence, we have no option but to declare that the company-designated doctor's certification is the final determination that must prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote>Also, in <i>Ayungo v. Beamko Shipmanagement Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68] </sup>the Court considered as prematurely filed the complaint for disability benefits sans prior referral of the conflicting findings of the CDP and the seafarer's physician to a third doctor for final assessment, thus:<br><blockquote>In this case, the findings of Beamko and Eagle Maritime's physicians that Ayungo's illnesses were not work-related were, in turn, controverted by Ayungo's personal doctor stating otherwise. <b>In light of these contrasting diagnoses, Ayungo prematurely filed his complaint before the NLRC without any regard to the conflict-resolution procedure under Section 20(B)(3) of the 2000 POEA-SEC</b>. Thus, consistent with <i>Philippine Hammonia</i>, the Court is inclined to uphold the opinion of Beamko and Eagle Maritime's physicians that Ayungo's illnesses were pre-existing and not work-related, hence, non-compensable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Evidently, Tiquio's failure to observe the conflict-resolution procedure under the POEA-SEC provided sufficient basis for the denial of his claim for total and permanent disability benefits. In fact, the Court observes that when he filed the complaint on September 1, 2014, Tiquio had yet to even present the contrary opinion from a doctor of his choice. It was only on December 16, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> when he filed his Rejoinder (to [Respondents'] Reply), that Tiquio presented the conflicting medical certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> which, interestingly, was obtained only on December 3, 2014. Notably, it bears pointing out that nowhere in said medical certificate was it shown that he consulted the independent doctor prior to the filing of the complaint, as claimed by him. Neither was it shown that he informed petitioners of his consultation with his personal doctor regarding his illness and of the latter's contradictory assessment at any time prior to instituting the disability benefits claim, which events could have triggered the conflict-resolution mechanism of the POEA-SEC.<br><br>Moreover, it deserves pointing out that, contrary to Tiquio's claim that petitioners have already waived their right to assert compliance with the conflict-resolution procedure,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> records do not disclose otherwise. On the contrary, records show that petitioners manifested their willingness to refer the matter to a third doctor during the mandatory conferences before the LA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Considering, however, that Tiquio has yet to present a second doctor's opinion, there was consequently no valid contest to the CDP's opinion that could have been referred to the third doctor for final assessment. To reiterate, jurisprudence states that the seafarer's non-compliance with the mandated conflict-resolution procedure under the POEA-SEC militates against his claims, thus resulting in the affirmance of the findings and assessment of the company-designated physician,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and effectively renders the complaint premature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Notably, the Court is aware of the rule that precludes application of said conflict-resolution mechanism in the absence of a final and definitive assessment issued by the CDP within the prescribed periods, which would, in such situation, render the seafarer's disability grading, by operation of law, total and permanent. Nonetheless, said exception to the third doctor rule does not apply in this case, considering that as of July 1, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the CDP had already diagnosed Tiquio to be suffering from Graves' Disease, which the CDP declared as "NOT Work Oriented," and on October 30, 2013, or well within the 120-day period, had finally assessed Tiquio as unfit for sea duty whose illness was "NOT Work Oriented" and would require "lifetime treatment with hormone replacement," for which no "[disability [grading is] xxx applicable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The CDP's assessment remained consistent throughout Tiquio's treatment, which petitioners generously continued to provide him with notwithstanding the not work-related and non-compensable findings of the CDP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In any event, the Court finds no reason to disturb said findings, considering that Tiquio failed to prove satisfaction of the four (4) conditions for compensability under Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 32-A. OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES<br><br>For an occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied:&nbsp; <br><ol><li> The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein:<br></li><li>The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks;<br></li><li>The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it; and<br></li><li> There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.<br></li></ol></blockquote>As the Court held in <i>Romana v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation</i> (<i>Romano</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> in contrast with the matter of work-relatedness which is indeed presumed, "no legal presumption of compensability is accorded in favor of the seafarer x x x [and thus], x x x he bears the burden of proving that these conditions are met."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Citing <i>Licayan v. Seacrest Maritime Management, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Romana more elaborately stated:<br><blockquote>[T]he disputable presumption does not signify an automatic grant of compensation and/or benefits claim, and that while the law disputably presumes an illness not found in Section 32-A to be also wdrk-related, <u>the seafarer/claimant nonetheless is burdened to present substantial evidence that his <i>work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the disease</i> and only a reasonable proof of work-connection, not direct causal relation is required <b>to establish its compensability</b></u><b>.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)</blockquote>To be sure, jurisprudence settles that the legal presumption of work-relatedness of a non-listed illness can be overturned only by contrary substantial evidence as defined above.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Nonetheless, it must be stressed that in all instances, the seafarer must prove compliance with the conditions for compensability, whether or not the work-relatedness of his illness is disputed by the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> As explained in <i>Romana</i>:<br><blockquote><i><u>On the one hand</u></i>, when an employer attempts to discharge the burden of disputing the presumption of work-relatedness (<i>i.e</i>., by either claiming that the illness is preexisting or, even if preexisting, that the risk of contracting or aggravating the same has nothing do with his work), the burden of evidence now shifts to the seafarer to prove otherwise (<i>i.e</i>., that the illness was not preexisting, or even if preexisting, that his work affected the risk of contracting or aggravating the illness). In so doing, the seafarer <i><u>effectively</u></i> discharges his own burden of proving compliance with the first three (3) conditions of compensability under Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC, <i>i.e</i>., that (1) the seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; (2) the disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks; and (3) the disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it. Thus, when the presumption of work-relatedness is contested by the employer, the factors which the seafarer needs to prove to rebut the employer's contestation would <b>necessarily overlap</b> with some of the conditions which the seafarer needs to prove to establish the compensability of his illness and the resulting disability<b>. In this regard, the seafarer, therefore, addresses the refutation of the employer against the work-relatedness of his illness and, <u>at the same time</u>, discharges his burden of proving compliance with certain conditions of compensability.</b><br></blockquote><blockquote><i><u>On the other hand</u></i>, when an employer does not attempt to discharge the burden of disputing the presumption of work-relatedness, the seafarer must still discharge his own burden of proving compliance with the conditions of compensability, which does not only include the three (3) conditions above-mentioned, but also, the distinct fourth condition, <i>i.e.</i>, that there was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer. Thereafter, the burden of evidence shifts to the employer to now disprove the veracity of the information presented by the seafarer. The employer may also raise any other affirmative defense which may preclude compensation, such as concealment under Section 20 (E) of the 2000 POEA-SEC or failure to comply with the third-doctor referral provision under Section 20 (B) (3) of the same Contract.<br><br>Subsequently, if the work-relatedness of the seafarer's illness is not successfully disputed by the employer, and the seafarer is then able to establish compliance with the conditions of compensability, the matter now shifts to a determination of the nature and, in turn, the amount of disability benefits to be paid to the seafarer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis, italics, and underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>In this case, Tiquio's illness, hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves' Disease, is an autoimmune disorder which causes over activity of the thyroid gland leading to the production and release of excess amounts of thyroid hormone into the blood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Medical literature defines "autoimmune disorder" as a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> The exact cause of Graves' Disease is not certain, however, certain risk factors are known to increase the chances of developing it, i.e., genetics, weight, certain medications, and smoking,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> as well as ethnicity and gender,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> including age, emotional or physical stress, and other autoimmune disorders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Graves' Disease is a known common cause of hyperthyroidism.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>As records show, the CDP, after due assessment of Tiquio's condition, found that his hyperthyroidism was primarily caused by the autoimmune disorder, Graves' Disease, and therefore not work-related. The CDP, an endocrinologist<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and thus an expert on Tiquio's condition, explained, in his Affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> dated October 16, 2014, the nature of this disease as backed by the medical literature on the same. To refute the assessment, Tiquio simply relied on the medical certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> issued by his doctor, Dr. San Luis, which concluded that his illness "could have been triggered by the physical and mental stress related to his job" and "by exposure to paint solvents and other chemicals."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> The Court, however, observes that Dr. San Luis is indisputably not an endocrinologist nor an expert on the particular disease – as he is a neurologist<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> – and whose assessment on Tiquio's condition was limited to a single encounter.<br><br>Moreover, the Court recognizes that, as discussed above, there are in fact several known risk factors that increase the chance of developing the disease, <i>i.e.</i>, genetics, age, weight, medications, ethnicity, and other autoimmune disease, none of which has been shown in this case to have any causal connection with Tiquio's duties as an ordinary seaman. While indeed stress is a known risk factor, there is nothing, however, in the records which demonstrates the nature and extent of the stress to which Tiquio was allegedly exposed that could have triggered or aggravated his condition.<br><br>Further, as regards Tiquio's alleged exposure to paint solvents and other chemicals, the Court finds nothing in the records which showed that the nature of his duties involved the same, and that such exposure contributed to the development of his illness. Notably, exposure to chemicals and paint solvents is not a known risk factor for developing Graves' Disease, and thus medical literature does not support Tiquio's assertions on the same. Accordingly, the Court cannot make a proper determination thereof, considering that, as the NLRC noted, Tiquio "did not even attempt to establish a causal connection between his functions as an ordinary [seaman] with the risks of contracting hyperthyroidism."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>To be sure, the Court is aware of the ruling in <i>Magsaysay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> relied upon by the CA, which granted the disability benefits claim of therein seafarer-claimant who was found to be suffering from hyperthyroidism by his chosen physician. It is well to point out, however, that the present case should be differentiated from <i>Magsaysay</i> for not only did therein petitioners Magsaysay Maritime Services and Princess Cruise Lines, Ltd. fail to explain or present evidence supporting the not work-related assessment of the CDP, who was not shown to be an expert on the disease, therein respondent seafarer Erlwin Meinrad Antero F. Laurel also sufficiently showed how his duties as a second pastryman and the conditions on board the vessel caused or aggravated his hyperthyroidism.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Here, and as discussed, petitioners were able to successfully debunk the presumption of work-relatedness and concomitantly, Tiquio failed to prove by substantial evidence his compliance with the conditions for compensabihty set forth under Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC. Thus, Tiquio's claim for disability benefits should be denied.<br><br>All told, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the NLRC in dismissing Tiquio's complaint.

In Graves' disease — for reasons that aren't well understood — the body produces an antibody to one part of the cells in the thyroid gland, a hormone-producing gland in the neck.<br><br>Normally, thyroid function is regulated by a hormone released by a tiny gland at the base of the brain (pituitary gland). The antibody associated with Graves' disease — thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) — acts like the regulatory pituitary hormone. That means that TRAb overrides the normal regulation of the thyroid,&nbsp; causing an overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism).<br><br>&lt; https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240 &gt; (visited May 27, 2019).<br><br>See further <https: www.medicinenet.com="" graves_disease="" article.htm#graves#39_disease_facts=""> (visited May 27, 2019); and <https: www.medicalnewstoday.com="" articles="" 170005.php=""> (visited May 27,2019).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Normally, "[t]he immune system destroys foreign invaders with substances called antibodies produced by blood cells known as lymphocytes. Sometimes the immune system can be tricked into making antibodies that cross-react with proteins on our own cells. In many cases these antibodies can cause destruction of those cells. In Graves' disease these antibodies (called the thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) or thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) do the opposite – they cause the cells to work overtime. The antibodies in Graves' disease bind to receptors on the surface of thyroid cells and stimulate those cells to overproduce and release thyroid hormones. This results in an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)." &lt; https://www.thyroid.org/graves-disease/ &gt; (visited May 27, 2019).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> See &lt; https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/what-are-common-symptoms-of-autoimmune-disease &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; (visited&nbsp;&nbsp; May&nbsp;&nbsp; 27,&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019);&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases- conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240 &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; (visited&nbsp;&nbsp; May&nbsp;&nbsp; 27,&nbsp;&nbsp; 2019);&nbsp;&nbsp; and &lt; http://www.btf-thyroid.org/information/leaflets/41-hyperthyroidism-guide &gt; (visited May 27, 2019).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> See &lt; https://www.healthline.com/health/autoimmune-disorders#causes &gt; (visited May 27, 2019);&nbsp; and &lt; https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240 &gt; (visited May 27, 2019).<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> See &lt; https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/graves-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356240&gt; (visited May 27, 2019).
