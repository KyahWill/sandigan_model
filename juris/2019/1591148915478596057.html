Resolving&nbsp; the&nbsp; issue, the&nbsp; Court&nbsp; held, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>We likewise rule that&nbsp; the RTC&nbsp; committed a serious error when it directed the Republic to pay respondents consequential damages equivalent&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; value&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; capital&nbsp; gains&nbsp;&nbsp; tax&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes necessary for the transfer of the subject property.<br></b><br>"Just&nbsp; compensation&nbsp; [is defined as] the full and fair equivalent&nbsp; of the property&nbsp; sought&nbsp; to&nbsp; be expropriated. x x x The&nbsp; measure is not&nbsp; the taker's gain&nbsp; but&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner's loss. [The compensation,&nbsp; to be just,] must be fair not only to the owner but also to the taker."<br><br>In order to determine just compensation, the trial court should first ascertain the market value of the property by considering the cost of acquisition, the current value of like properties, its actual or potential uses, and in the particular case of lands, their size, shape, location, and the tax declarations&nbsp; thereon.<b> If as a result&nbsp; of the expropriation, the&nbsp; remaining lot suffers from&nbsp; an impairment or decrease in value,&nbsp; consequential damages may&nbsp; be awarded by the trial&nbsp; court, provided that&nbsp; the consequential benefits&nbsp; which&nbsp; may arise&nbsp; from&nbsp; the expropriation do not exceed said&nbsp; damages suffered by the owner&nbsp; of the property.</b><br><br>While it is true that "the determination of the amount of just compensation&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; within&nbsp; the&nbsp; court's&nbsp;&nbsp; discretion,&nbsp; it&nbsp; should&nbsp; not&nbsp; be&nbsp; done arbitrarily or capriciously. [Rather,] it must [always] be based on all established&nbsp; rules, upon correct legal principles and competent&nbsp; evidence." The court cannot base its judgment on mere speculations and surmises.<br><br>In the present case, the RTC deemed it "fair and just that x x x whatever&nbsp; is the value of the [CGT] and all other taxes necessary for the transfer of the subject property to the [Republic] are but consequential damages that should be paid by the latter." x x x<br><br>xxxx<br><br>This is clearly an error. <b>It is settled&nbsp; that&nbsp; the transfer of property through expropriation proceedings is a sale&nbsp; or&nbsp; exchange within&nbsp; the meaning&nbsp; of&nbsp; Sections&nbsp;&nbsp; 24(D)&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; 56(A)(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; National Internal Revenue Code,&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; profit&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; transaction&nbsp; constitutes capital gain.&nbsp;<u> Since&nbsp;&nbsp; [CGT]&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; tax&nbsp; on&nbsp; passive&nbsp; income,&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the&nbsp; seller,&nbsp; or respondents in this case, who are liable to shoulder the tax.</u></b><br><br>In fact, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), in BIR Ruling No. 476-2013 dated December 18, 2013, has constituted the DPWH as a withholding agent tasked to withhold the 6% final withholding tax in the expropriation of real property for infrastructure projects. Thus, as far as the&nbsp; government is concerned, the [CGT] in expropriation proceedings remains a liability of the seller, as it is a tax on the seller's gain from the sale of real property.<br><br><b>Besides,&nbsp; as&nbsp; previously explained, consequential&nbsp; damages&nbsp; are only&nbsp;&nbsp; awarded&nbsp; if&nbsp; as&nbsp; a&nbsp; result&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; expropriation,&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; remaining property of&nbsp; the&nbsp; owner&nbsp;&nbsp; suffers from&nbsp; an&nbsp; impairment or&nbsp; decrease&nbsp; in value.</b> In this case, no evidence was submitted to prove any impairment or decrease in value of the subject property as a result of the expropriation. More significantly, given that the payment of [CGT] on the transfer of the subject property has no effect on the increase or decrease in value of the remaining property, it can hardly be considered as consequential damages that&nbsp; may&nbsp; be&nbsp; awarded&nbsp; to&nbsp; respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis&nbsp; and&nbsp; underscoring supplied while those in the original omitted)</blockquote>The Court's ruling&nbsp; in <i>Spouses Salvador</i> is clear -CGT may not&nbsp; be awarded&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; form&nbsp; of&nbsp; consequential damages&nbsp; since&nbsp; the&nbsp; term&nbsp; assumes&nbsp; a fixed&nbsp; definition&nbsp; in the context&nbsp; of expropriation proceedings; it is limited&nbsp; to the impairment or decrease&nbsp; in value&nbsp; of the portion&nbsp; which&nbsp; remains&nbsp; with the affected owner<i> after</i> expropriation.<br><br>It&nbsp; must&nbsp; be&nbsp; clarified,&nbsp;&nbsp; however,&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; ruling&nbsp; in&nbsp; Spouses&nbsp; Salvador should&nbsp; not be interpreted to preclude&nbsp; the courts&nbsp; from&nbsp; considering the value of&nbsp;&nbsp; CGT&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; transfer&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; determining&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; amount&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; just compensation to be awarded&nbsp; to the affected owner.<br><br>To recall, Section 5 of Republic Act No. (RA) 8974<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> sets forth the standards&nbsp; in the determination of just compensation.

These costs must be taken into consideration&nbsp; in determining&nbsp; just compensation&nbsp; in the same way these costs are factored&nbsp; into the selling&nbsp; price of real property&nbsp; in an arm's length&nbsp; transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably,&nbsp; the&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; expropriated&nbsp;&nbsp; property,&nbsp; as declared by the affected owner, and the current selling price of similar lands are factors listed under Section 5 of RA 8974.<br><br>Here,&nbsp; Spouses&nbsp; Bunsay&nbsp; received,&nbsp; as&nbsp; just&nbsp; compensation,&nbsp; an&nbsp; amount equal&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; sum&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; zonal&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Disputed&nbsp; Property&nbsp; and&nbsp; the replacement cost of the improvements&nbsp; built thereon. Evidently, the value of CGT and transfer taxes due on the transfer of the Disputed Property was not factored into the amount paid to Spouses Bunsay, but instead, separately awarded as consequential damages.<br><br>While the award of consequential&nbsp; damages equivalent to the value of CGT and transfer taxes must be struck down for being erroneous, the Court deems it just and equitable to direct the Republic to shoulder such taxes to preserve the compensation&nbsp; awarded to Spouses Bunsay as a consequence of the expropriation. To stress, compensation, to be just, must be of such value as to fully rehabilitate&nbsp; the affected owner; it must be sufficient to make the affected owner <i>whole.</i><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,&nbsp; </b> premises&nbsp; considered,&nbsp; the&nbsp; Petition&nbsp; is&nbsp; <b>GRANTED. </b>The&nbsp; Order/Resolution&nbsp; and&nbsp; Order&nbsp; respectively&nbsp; dated&nbsp; August&nbsp; 23,&nbsp; 2012&nbsp; and January 10, 2013 rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, Branch 270, in Civil Case No. 188-V-11 are<b> MODIFIED,&nbsp; i</b>n that the award of consequential&nbsp; damages, equivalent&nbsp; to the value of capital gains tax and other transfer taxes, is <b>DELETED.</b><br><br>Nevertheless,&nbsp; the petitioner&nbsp; is <b>DIRECTED </b> to shoulder&nbsp; such capital gains tax and other transfer taxes as part of the just compensation due the respondents.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.J., (Chairperson), Caguioa, J.
