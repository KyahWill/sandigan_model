On August 5, 2007, the police apprehended the illegal vendors in the area. Jun asked brothers Aries and Argie Reyes to allow his mother to leave her wares and vegetables in their stall. But the Reyes brothers refused. An argument then ensued between them and Jun.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> In the late afternoon, Jun and his wife Catherine packed up their wares and prepared to go home. But before leaving the area, Jun went back to Hidalgo Street for the shoulder bag he left earlier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> When Aries, Demetrio, Arthur, and Argie saw Jun, they pursued him. As Jun tried to run away, Demetrio hit him with a plastic chair in the head, causing the former to fall to the ground. Arthur and Aries then alternately hit him with broomsticks. Jun, nonetheless, managed to get back on his feet and run toward Villalobos Street. But when he reached the comer of Villalobos Street, Argie was there waiting. Argie stabbed Jun in the left side of his body. Though wounded, Jun did not stop running. Shortly after, Argie caught up with him and stabbed him a second time, hitting him in the arm. Jun fell anew. Meantime, Arthur and Aries arrived. Before they could further hit Jun, Catherine stepped in and begged them to stop. The two desisted, albeit Arthur uttered <i>"Putang inang yan eh!.

According to them, when the stabbing incident took place, they were playing <i>"pusoy"</i> inside the Picache Building. The victim came and got into a heated argument with Argie. Jun brandished a small knife at Argie. They grappled for the knife until Argie succeeded in wresting it from Jun. The latter retreated but Argie gave chase. Argie caught up with and stabbed Jun. After Jun fell to the ground, Argie ran away. The incident had already ended when Aries, Demetrio, and Arthur arrived.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p>Before the incident, Rosalina Reyes, mother of the Reyes brothers, received threats from Jun's brothers regarding a space she bought from Demetrio.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> The defense did not present any documentary evidence. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Trial Court's Ruling</u></b> </p><p> By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated August 27, 2014, the trial court found appellants guilty of murder, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the prosecution having established the guilt of accused Aries Reyes y Hilario and Demetrio Sahagun y Manalili beyond reasonable doubt, this Court finds both guilty of the crime of Murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength and aggravated by treachery, thereby sentencing them the penalty of reclusion perpetua, without eligibility for parole, and all its accessory penalties. </p> <p>Considering that they are detention prisoners, the period of their detention must be credited in the service of their sentence.</p> <p> Further, they are held solidarity liable to pay the heirs of the victim, Jun Balmores y Atun, the following amounts:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity;<br> (2) P32,799.65 as medical, funeral and burial expenses;<br> (3) P500,000.00 as temperate damages, in lieu of loss of earning capacity;<br> (4) P50,000.00 as moral damages; and <br> (5) P35,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.</p> </blockquote> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b><u>The Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</u></b> </p><p> On appeal, appellants faulted the trial court for: (1) convicting them of murder despite the prosecution's alleged failure to prove with moral certainty their complicity and conspiracy; (2) appreciating treachery and abuse of superior strength despite the clear evidence on record that Jun and the Reyes brothers had a misunderstanding prior to the stabbing incident; and (3) disregarding their defense of denial. </p><p> On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) through Assistant Solicitor General Ellaine Rose A. Sanchez-Corro and State Solicitor Lucy L. Butler-Torres maintained that the prosecution was able to sufficiently prove that appellants and their co-accused conspired in killing the victim with treachery and abuse of superior strength. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</u></b> </p><p> In its assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated March 10, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed, with modification. It found that treachery attended the killing. As for abuse of superior strength, it ruled that the same was deemed absorbed in treachery. It further reduced the awards of actual and exemplary damages to P28,266.15 and P30,000.00, respectively; increased the award of moral damages to P75,000.00; and imposed six percent interest per annum on these amounts, from finality of the decision until fully paid. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Present Appeal</u></b> </p><p> Appellants now seek affirmative relief from the Court and pray anew for a verdict of acquittal.

They in fact acted in concert toward one common purpose: to kill Jun Balmores. This is conspiracy. In conspiracy, the parties need not actually come together and agree in express terms to enter into and pursue a common design. It is enough that at the time of the commission of the offense, the accused or assailants had the same purpose and were united in its execution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> as in this case. </p><p> Thus, upon seeing Jun back on Hidalgo Street, appellants and their co­ accused altogether pursued Jun. As Jun tried to run away, Demetrio hit him in the head, causing Jun to fall to the ground. Arthur and Aries then alternately hit Jun with broomstick handles. Jun managed to get back on his feet and run. When he reached the comer of Villalobos Street, Argie was there waiting. Argie then stabbed Jun in the left side part of his body. Though wounded, Jun did not stop running for his life. But Argie easily caught up with and stabbed Jun another time, hitting him in the arm. This caused Jun to fall anew and never again rose to his feet. </p><p> Per Dr. Bienvenido Torres' Medical/Autopsy Report,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Jun died of "hypovolemic shock secondary to stab wound of the trunk."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The fact that it was Argie alone who delivered the final <i>coup de grace</i> on the victim did not diminish appellants' shared culpability. In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i><b>The third element - the presence of any of the qualifying circumstances under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code</b></i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In the alternative, appellants argue that, if at all, they should be found guilty only of homicide, not murder. They vigorously claim that neither treachery nor abuse of superior strength was proved to have attended the victim's killing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> The essence of treachery is the swift, deliberate, and unexpected manner by which the offense was committed, affording the victim no opportunity to resist, escape, much less, defend himself or herself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The offender must have planned the mode of attack to ensure its execution without exposing himself to any danger which may come from the victim's act of retaliation or self-defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p>Here, although Jun and the Reyes brothers got into an argument in the morning of August 5, 2007, the same appeared to have ended several hours before the killing took place. In fact, according to Jun's wife Catherine, they had packed up their things and prepared to go home in the late afternoon of August 5, 2007. Jun, however, walked back to Hidalgo Street for the shoulder bag he left earlier. </p><p> There is no showing, as none was shown, that appellants and their co-accused knew Jun was going back to the area at that late time of the day and that they had planned to attack Jun there and then. On the contrary, appellants and their co-accused appeared to have spontaneously acted as soon as they saw Jun back in the area. They instantaneously pursued him, one hit him with a plastic chair in the head, two alternately whipped him with broomstick handles, one waylaid and stabbed him in the side of his body, and later, in his arm. </p><p><i>People of the Philippines vs. Cañaveras</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> ruled that treachery is not present when the killing is not premeditated or where the sudden attack is not preconceived and deliberately adopted, but is just triggered by a sudden infuriation on the part of the accused as a result of a provocative act of the victim, or when the killing is done at the spur of the moment. </p><p>Another point, even after Jun fell to the ground and appellants alternately hit him with broomstick handles, he still managed to get back on his feet and run for his life. And although Argie subsequently waylaid and stabbed him in the left side of his body, he did not stop running. The only time he did was when Argie caught up and stabbed him another time. </p><p>Evidently, although Jun did not expect the sudden and concerted attack of his assailants who were each armed with either a chair, broomstick handles, or a knife, he was not rendered totally defenseless or prevented from escaping his assailants. In fact, he was able to get back on his feet and run for his life, albeit in the end, he still lost his life due to the stab wound he sustained in his trunk. </p><p>In conclusion, the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not shown to have attended the killing of Jun Balmores. </p><p> In another vein, We agree with the ruling of the Court of Appeals that abuse of superior strength, when absorbed in treachery, cannot be appreciated as a separate qualifying or aggravating circumstance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It must be clarified though that this rule applies only when both circumstances concur. Thus, when treachery is absent, as in this case, abuse of superior strength may be appreciated as a distinct circumstance which may qualify the killing to murder.</p><p> Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor/s that is plainly and obviously advantageous to the aggressor/s and purposely selected or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Evidence must show that the aggressor/s consciously sought the advantage, or their deliberate intent to use it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> No such evidence obtains in this case. Abuse of superior strength cannot be inferred, as the trial court erroneously did, simply from the fact that Jun was outnumbered four to one. Mere superiority in numbers is not indicative of the presence of abuse of superior strength.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Neither can the Court consider as evidence thereof the fact alone that appellants and their co-accused were each armed either with broomstick handles, plastic chair, or knife. As shown, there is no evidence that appellants and their companions planned the attack or purposely sought the advantage of superior strength by arming themselves to put the victim in such notorious disadvantage to ensure the commission of the crime. </p><p> In sum, there being no qualifying circumstance attendant to the killing of Jun Balmores, appellants may only be convicted of homicide<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p>Art. 249. Homicide. — Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246, shall kill another without the attendance of any of the circumstances enumerated in the next preceding article, shall be deemed guilty of homicide and be punished by reclusion temporal. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><b><u>Penalty</u></b> </p> <p>Applying the indeterminate sentence law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> appellants should be sentenced to eight years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> as minimum to fourteen years, eight months and one day of<em> reclusion temporal</em> as maximum. </p> <p> In accordance with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the heirs of Jun Balmores are entitled to civil indemnity of P50,000.00 and moral damages of P50,000.00. Exemplary damages may not be awarded here since no aggravating circumstance was proved. </p><p>We affirm the award of P28,266.15 as actual damages for medical, funeral and burial expenses as the same were duly supported by receipts under Exhibits "F"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and "G."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p>On the alleged loss of earning capacity, there is no evidence on record to prove the actual extent thereof. What the record bears is Catherine's lone testimony that her late husband, in his lifetime, used to earn P2,000.00 a week as vendor; P1,500.00 a month for each of the six students who availed of his school service; and P700.00 per trip as part-time personal driver. Catherine's unsubstantiated testimony thereon is not sufficient, nay competent for the purpose of awarding actual damages tor loss of earning capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p>Be that as it may, temperate damages may be awarded where the earning capacity is clearly established but no evidence was presented to prove the actual income of the offended party or the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Article 2224 of the Civil Code so provides, thus: </p><blockquote> <p>Temperate or moderate damages, which are more than nominal but less than compensatory damages, may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be provided with certainty. </p> </blockquote> <p>Here, the Court of Appeals awarded P500,000.00 as temperate damages to the Heirs of Jun Balmores. But this amount appears to be in excess of the usual earnings of a typical vendor or tricycle driver in Quiapo, Manila. </p> <p> In <i>Tan vs. OMC Carriers, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court held that the award of P300,000.00 as temperate damages to the heirs of a deceased tailor conformed with the usually known earnings of a tailor, <em>viz</em>: </p><blockquote> <p>According to the petitioners, prior to his death, Celedonio was a self-employed tailor who earned approximately P156,000.00 a year, or P13,000.00 a month. At the time of his death in 1995, the prevailing daily minimum wage was P145.00, or P3,770.00 per month, provided the wage earner had only one rest day per week. Even if we take judicial notice of the fact that a small tailoring shop normally does not issue receipts to its customers, and would probably not have any documentary evidence of the income it earns, Celedonio's alleged monthly income of P13,000.00 greatly exceeded the prevailing monthly minimum wage; thus, the exception set forth above does not apply. </p> <p> In the past, we awarded temperate damages in lieu of actual damages for loss of earning capacity where earning capacity is plainly established but no evidence was presented to support the allegation of the injured party's actual income.</p> <p> In Pleno v. Court of Appeals, we sustained the award of temperate damages in the amount of P200,000.00 instead of actual damages for loss of earning capacity because the plaintiff's income was not sufficiently proven.</p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> xxx xxx xxx </p><p> We adopt the same amount of P300,000.00 as temperate damages here. For this amount appears to approximate the earnings of Jun Balmores for his triple job as vendor, school service driver, and personal driver. </p><p><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appeal is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>, and the Decision dated March 10, 2016 of the Court of Appeals, <b>MODIFIED</b>. </p><p>Aries H. Reyes and Demetrio M. Sahagun are found guilty of homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to fourteen years, eight months and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum. </p><p> They are further ordered to jointly and severally pay the heirs of Jun Balmores P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; P50,000.00 as moral damages; P28,266.15 as actual damages for medical, funeral and burial expenses; and P300,000.00 as temperate damages, in lieu of actual damages for loss of earning capacity.
