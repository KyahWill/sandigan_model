She pointed out in her motion to dismiss that the investigation took more or less six (6) years before the OMB issued the resolution on the complaint on December 6, 2016 and filed the Information on December 1, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>Meanwhile, on January 31, 2018, Tirol, Galbreath, Imboy, Camacho-Â­Lejos, and Apalisok-Piollo also filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> essentially echoing Cajes-Yap's argument as regards the inordinate delay in the investigation and filing of the Information.

Hence, there was no oppressive delay. If there was any, it claimed that the delay is reasonable as the case involves twenty-five (25) respondents <em>a quo</em>, and the evaluation and study of the entire case records will take some time to complete.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p>Subsequently, Lopez and Damalerio II,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> later joined by Trabajo,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as well as Herrera,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> filed their respective motions to dismiss.

Particularly, it pointed out that, contrary to the prosecution's claim, records show that the fact-finding investigation began in 2012 and thus, it took the OMB almost six (6) years to complete the fact-finding and preliminary investigation before it filed the Information on December 1, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Moreover, it noted that the prosecution did not provide any plausible explanation for the delay. Thus, it dismissed the case as against them for violation of their constitutional right to a speedy disposition of their case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p>Subsequently, in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated April 17, 2018, the SB granted the motions filed by Lopez and Damalerio II, as adopted by Trabajo and Herrera, and accordingly, dismissed the case as against them on the same grounds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p>In view of the foregoing, the OMB filed separate motions for reconsideration which were, however, denied by the SB in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated June 4, 2018, holding that the right to speedy disposition of cases covers not only the period within which the preliminary investigation was conducted, but also all stages to which the accused was subjected, even including the fact-finding investigations conducted prior to the preliminary investigation proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p>Hence, the present petition.</p><p align="center"><strong>The Issue Before the Court</strong></p><p>The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the SB committed grave abuse of discretion in quashing the Information, and accordingly, dismissing the case against respondents on the ground of inordinate delay.</p><p align="center"><strong>The Court's Ruling</strong></p><p>The petition is meritorious.</p><p>There is grave abuse of discretion when: (1) an act is done contrary to the Constitution, law, or jurisprudence; or (2) it is executed whimsically, capriciously, or arbitrarily out of malice, ill-will, or personal bias.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> As will be shown below, the SB was guilty of grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed the criminal cases against respondents on the ground of inordinate delay.</p><p>Section 16, Article III of the Constitution guarantees every person's right to speedy disposition of his cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies. This constitutional right is not limited to the accused in criminal proceedings but extends to all parties in all cases, be it civil or administrative in nature, as well as in all proceedings, either judicial or quasi-judicial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In this regard, Section 12,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Article XI of the Constitution and Section 13<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of RA 6770<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> specifically commands the OMB and his or her deputies to act promptly on all complaints brought before his/her Office.</p><p>To be sure, neither the Constitution nor RA 6770 provides for a specific period within which to measure promptness, and corollary thereto, determine whether the right to speedy disposition of cases is violated. The administration of justice, however, does not deal primarily with speed, and delay, when reasonable under the circumstances, does not by itself violate said right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p>Accordingly, it has been held that a mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved is not sufficient to rule that there was inordinate delay as it requires a consideration of a number of factors, including a consideration of the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <strong>These factors include: the length of delay, the reason for delay, the defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his or her right, and the prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p>In the fairly recent case of <em>Cagang v. Sandiganbayan</em> (<em>Cagang</em>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court clarified that the period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay considering that fact-finding investigations are not yet adversarial proceedings against the accused. Thus, it is settled that <strong>a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation</strong>, to wit:</p><blockquote><p><strong>When an anonymous complaint is filed or the Office of the Ombudsman conducts a <em>motu proprio</em> fact-finding investigation, the proceedings are not yet adversarial. Even if the accused is invited to attend these investigations, this period cannot be counted since these are merely preparatory to the filing of a formal complaint. At this point, the Office of the Ombudsman will not yet determine if there is probable cause to charge the accused.</strong></p><p>This period for case build-up cannot likewise be used by the Office of the Ombudsman as unbridled license to delay proceedings. If its investigation takes too long, it can result in the extinction of criminal liability through the prescription of the offense.</p><p><strong>Considering that fact-finding investigations are not yet adversarial proceedings against the accused, the period of investigation will not be counted in the determination of whether the right to speedy disposition of cases was violated</strong>. Thus, this Court now holds that for the purpose of determining whether inordinate delay exists, a case is deemed to have commenced from the filing of the formal complaint and the subsequent conduct of the preliminary investigation. In <em>People v. Sandiganbayan, Fifth Division</em> [723 Phil. 444 (2013)], the ruling that fact-finding investigations are included in the period for determination of inordinate delay is abandoned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</p></blockquote><p>Applying the foregoing, the Court finds that respondents' right to the speedy disposition of cases has not been violated.</p><p>Preliminarily, it is undisputed that the complaint against respondents was filed with the OMB on November 6, 2014 and it was only thereafter that they were required to respond to the charges and participate in the investigation. Prior thereto, respondents were not subjected to any adversarial proceeding even when the fact-finding investigation began as early as 2012. As records disclose, the period prior to the filing of the complaint entailed only the determination of facts and the personalities involved, including the gathering of evidence, but without involving any of the respondents in said investigation proceedings. Thus, consistent with <em>Cagang</em>, the reckoning point in this case when delay started to run was on November 6, 2014, when the <strong>case was deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation.</strong></p><p>Proceeding from said reckoning point, the Court finds no inordinate delay in the conduct and termination of the preliminary investigation by the OMB. Records show that upon the filing of the complaint by the FIO on <strong>November 6, 2014</strong>, the OMB immediately directed the twenty-five (25) respondents <em>a quo</em> to file their respective counter-affidavits. Said respondents <em>a quo</em>, however, complied with the Order only on February 16, 18, and 20, 2015. Thereafter, the OMB issued the probable cause Resolution from which respondents subsequently sought reconsideration. The OMB, however, denied said motions in the Order dated March 7, 2017 and on <strong>December 1, 2017</strong>, it filed the Information. Thus, only a period of three (3) years and twenty-five (25) days has elapsed from the filing of the complaint up to the filing of the Information before the SB. During this period, the OMB had to investigate and provide all twenty-five (25) respondents <em>a quo</em> with sufficient opportunity to study the evidence against them and respond to the charges. It also had to review numerous records and documents relative to the charges involving several purchase transactions of heavy equipment in two (2) separate years, <em>i.e.</em>, 2006 and 2009, and arrive at the probable cause resolution. All the while, the preliminary investigation of the criminal case ran parallel to the adjudication of the counterpart administrative case. Given these circumstances, the Court is hard-pressed to consider the period as vexatious, capricious, or oppressive to respondents to warrant the dismissal of the case on the ground of inordinate delay.</p><p>Moreover, it is significant to note that respondents have not asserted their right to speedy disposition of cases during said period. Indeed, records show that respondents were fully aware of the conduct of the preliminary investigation through the filing of their counter-affidavits, as well as their subsequent motions for reconsideration from the OMB's probable cause Resolution. Despite the pendency of the case before the OMB since 2014, however, respondents only invoked said right after the Information was already filed with the SB on December 1, 2017. As the Court held in <em>Cagang</em>, the right to speedy disposition of cases, same as the right to speedy trial, must be timely raised through an appropriate motion, failing in which, he or she is deemed to have acquiesced to the delay and thus, has waived these rights,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> as in this case.</p><p>All told, there was no inordinate delay committed by the OMB that transgressed respondents' right to a speedy disposition of their case. Accordingly, the Court finds that the SB gravely abused its discretion in granting respondents' motion to dismiss/quash the Information and in dismissing the case against them.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition for <em>certiorari</em> is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
