After undergoing the required pre-employment medical examination (PEME),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> petitioner was declared fit for sea duty, and thus, boarded the vessel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On October 18, 2014, while doing sanding works, petitioner heard a snap and crunching sound in his back followed by tremendous pain. Upon reaching the port of Taiwan on October 20, 2014, petitioner was sent to the hospital, where he was initially diagnosed to be suffering from L3-L4 Spondylolisthesis and L3 Pars Fracture.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Consequently, he was repatriated on October 23, 2014 and referred to the company-designated physician, who performed several tests on him, advised him to undergo physical therapy, and even suggested back surgery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Eventually, on February 6, 2015, the company-designated physician issued a medical report,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> stating, inter alia, that "<u>[f]itness to work is unlikely to be given within his 120 days of treatment</u>" and that "<u>[i]f patient is entitled to disability, his suggested disability grading is Grade 8 - loss of 2/3 lifting power of the trunk</u>," <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Based on the patient's present status, his prognosis is guarded.<br><br>The specialist recommends surgery with Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion.

Moreover, respondents pointed out that petitioner committed notorious negligence, since the latter refused surgery as suggested by the company-designated physician, despite the fact that the expenses thereof would be shouldered by the former.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b>The NCMB's Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated October 1, 2015, the NCMB ruled in favor of petitioner, and accordingly, ordered respondents to jointly and severally pay him: (a) US$120,000.00, or its peso equivalent, as maximum disability compensation pursuant to the CBA; and (b) 10% attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>It held that petitioner's back injury was sustained in the course of performing his duties as an Able Seaman while exerting force with his upper extremities and hence, work-related. Besides, the company-designated physician failed to issue a report or opinion to the effect that the medical condition was not work-related.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the NCMB observed that the event so described, wherein petitioner suffered tremendous pain immediately when he heard a snap and crunching sound on his back during exertion, falls within the definition of accidental injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On this score, it further noted that page three (3) of the October 21, 2014 Medical Report Form - which appears to have been suppressed by respondents as the same was not included in its evidence - discloses that the certifying doctor encircled the text "Yes"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> in response to the question "Is the illness due to an accident."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Hence, the NCMB concluded that petitioner is entitled to maximum disability compensation pursuant to the CBA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, respondents moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> but were denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated January 7, 2016; hence, the matter was elevated<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA's Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated March 28, 2018, the CA set aside the NCMB's ruling and held that petitioner was only entitled to Grade 8 disability benefits under the POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Essentially, the CA gave more credence to the findings of the company-designated physician that petitioners' disability was "Grade 8 - loss of 2/3 lifting power of the trunk"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> considering that its assessment contained in the February 6, 2015 medical report was arrived at after examining petitioner thoroughly, and after requiring him to undergo a series of medical tests, physical therapy, and medication, as evidenced by six (6) medical reports. On the other hand, the conclusion of petitioner's independent physician, Dr. Magtira, that petitioner was unfit for sea duty, was made without proof of the medical procedures, examinations, or tests, which would form the basis thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioner moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> but was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated July 10, 2018; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in ruling that petitioner is entitled to only Grade 8 disability benefits under the POEA-SEC.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>It is settled that the entitlement of a seafarer on overseas employment to disability benefits is governed by law, the parties' contracts, and the medical findings. The relevant statutory provisions are Articles 197 to 199<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (formerly Articles 191 to 193) of the Labor Code, in relation to Section 2 (a),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Rule X of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, whereas the material contracts are the POEA-SEC and the parties' CBA, if any.<br><br><center>I.<br></center><br>Pursuant to the 2010 POEA-SEC, which applies to this case, the employer is liable for disability benefits only when the seafarer suffers from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In this regard, work-related injury is defined as an injury arising out of and in the course of employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Upon finding that the seafarer suffers a work-related injury or illness, the employer is obligated to refer the former to a company-designated physician, who has the responsibility to arrive at a definite assessment of the former's fitness or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, if the seafarer requires further medical treatment, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this extended period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The responsibility of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment within the prescribed periods necessitates that the perceived disability rating has been properly established and inscribed in a valid and timely medical report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> To be conclusive and to give proper disability benefits to the seafarer, this assessment must be <b>complete and definite</b>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> otherwise, the medical report shall be set aside and the disability grading contained therein shall be ignored.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> As case law holds, a final and definite disability assessment is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries of the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Failure of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the prescribed periods and if the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the law steps in to consider the latter's disability as total and permanent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, records reveal that petitioner sustained a back injury while doing sanding works as an Able Seaman during his employment on board respondents' vessel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> For respondents' part, there appears to be no categorical assessment from the company-designated physician that petitioner's injury was not work-related, as the former even suggested a partial disability grading.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Clearly, these facts negate respondents' claim that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of employment, and hence, must be deemed work-related.<br><br>Moreover, while the company-designated physician's assessment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> was issued within the 120-day period, which was on February 6, 2015 or 106 days after petitioner's repatriation, it could not have been a final and definite assessment as mandated by law, considering the language of the assessment showing that the disability grading was merely <u><b>interim</b></u>, as it was declared that "<b>prognosis is guarded</b>" and "<b>[i]f</b> patient is entitled to a disability, his suggested disability grading is Grade 8 - loss of 2/3 lifting power of the trunk." Notably, the company-designated physician even informed petitioner that "<b>[f]itness to work is unlikely</b> to be given <b>within his 120 days</b> of treatment." The medical report reads:<br><blockquote>Based on the patient's present status, his <b>prognosis is guarded</b>.<br><br>The specialist recommends surgery with Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion. However, the patient has refused the surgery. Without the surgery, he has already reached maximum medical improvement.<br><br><b>Fitness to work is unlikely to be given within his 120 days of treatment.</b><br><br><b>If</b> patient is entitled to disability, his <b><u>suggested</u> disability grading</b> is Grade 8 - loss of 2/3 lifting power of the trunk.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Consequently, the company-designated physician's assessment should not prevail and must be completely disregarded, since it was merely an "interim" assessment. Being an interim disability grading, the declaration was merely an initial prognosis of petitioner's condition for the time being, which does not fully assess his condition and cannot provide sufficient basis for an award of disability benefits in his favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Moreover, notwithstanding such interim assessment and declaration of unfitness to work, the company-designated physician failed to indicate the need for further treatment/rehabilitation or medication, and provide an estimated period of treatment to justify the extension of the 120-day period. Evidently, without the required final and definite assessment declaring petitioner fit to resume work or the degree of his disability, the characterization of the latter's condition after the lapse of the 120-day period as total and permanent ensued by operation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Besides, petitioner's injury persisted despite the company designated-physician's declaration of partial disability Grade 8. Thus, applying Article 198 (c) (1) of the Labor Code, petitioner's disability should be deemed total and permanent. In this regard, it must be emphasized that in the determination of whether a disability, is total or partial, what is crucial is whether the employee who suffered from disability could still perform his work notwithstanding the injuries he sustained. <b>A permanent partial disability presupposes a seafarer's fitness to resume sea duties before the end of the 120/240-day medical treatment period</b> despite the injuries sustained, and works on the premise that such partial injuries did not disable a seafarer to earn wages in the same kind of work or similar nature for which he was trained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Total disability does not require that the employee be completely disabled or totally paralyzed. In disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, but it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Corollarily, the compliance with the third-doctor referral provision of the 2010 POEA-SEC is rendered inapplicable, considering that absent a final assessment from the company-designated physician, the seafarer has nothing to contest and the law steps in to conclusively characterize his disability as total and permanent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Neither can the Court subscribe to respondents' claim that petitioner's refusal to undergo surgery can be considered as notorious negligence that would bar the latter from claiming compensation. Notorious negligence has been defined as something more than mere or simple negligence or contributory negligence; it signifies a deliberate act of the employee to disregard his own personal safety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Here, there is no showing that the latter was informed that surgery was the sole remedy to address his back injury nor warned of the effect of his choice of physical therapy.<br><br>Given the foregoing circumstances, the Court finds that the NCMB did not gravely abuse its discretion in holding that petitioner is deemed permanently and totally disabled and should be entitled to the corresponding disability benefits.<br><br><center>II.<br></center><br>As to the amount of petitioner's entitlement, Article 25 (1) of the CBA provides that the company shall pay compensation to a seaman for any injury or death arising from an accident while in the employment of the company and for this purpose, shall effect a 24-hour insurance coverage in accordance with Appendix III<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to the agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> An accident has been defined as an unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence; something that does not occur in the usual course of events or that could not be reasonably anticipated; an unforeseen and injurious occurrence not attributable to mistake, negligence, neglect or misconduct; that which happens by chance or fortuitously, without intention and design, and which is unexpected, unusual, and unforeseen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner was performing his duty, <i>i.e.</i>, sanding works, as an Able Seaman when he heard a snap and crunching sound in his back immediately followed by tremendous pain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He could not have anticipated such unusual and unexpected snap in his back, since he merely exerted normal force with his upper extremities and such exertion does not at all times cause back injury. Thus, for being an unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence, the sudden snap on petitioner's back could qualify as an accident.<br><br>Moreover, as aptly observed by the NCMB, respondents did not include in its evidence page three (3) of the Medical Report Form, which reveals that the certifying doctor encircled the text "Yes" in response to the question "Is the illness due to an accident."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Thus, it appears that they have suppressed such evidence, which would have been an admission contained in a pleading that is conclusive against the pleader,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> confirming that petitioner indeed suffered an accident.<br><br>Accordingly, petitioner is entitled to the total and permanent disability compensation under the CBA in the amount of US$120,000.00, as well as attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the award for being forced to litigate. However, the claims for moral and exemplary damages are not warranted for lack of substantial evidence showing that respondents acted with malice or bad faith in refusing petitioner's claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
