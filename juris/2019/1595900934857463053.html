				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">There is no constitutional right to bear arms. Neither is the ownership or possession of a firearm a property right. Persons intending to use a firearm can only either accept or decline the government's terms for its use.<br><br>The grant of license, however, is without prejudice to the inviolability of the home. The right of the people against unreasonable searches and seizures remains paramount, and the government, in the guise of regulation, cannot conduct inspections of applicants for firearm licenses unless armed with a search warrant.<br><br>This Court resolves the consolidated Petitions assailing the constitutionality of certain provisions of Republic Act No. 10591, or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act, and their corresponding provisions in the 2013 Implementing Rules and Regulations for allegedly violating petitioners' right to bear arms, right to property, and right to privacy.<br><br>Republic Act No. 10591, enacted on May 29, 2013, currently regulates the ownership, possession, carrying, manufacture, dealing in, and importation of firearms and ammunition in the country.

According to it, the Philippine National Police continued to require applicants to sign the Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection in the <i>pro forma</i> application form for firearm registration even after the Temporary Restraining Order had been issued. Moreover, the Philippine National Police opened only some but not all of its regional offices and accredited testing centers, with the remaining 90% of applicants from the provinces still being required to file their applications at Camp Crame, Quezon City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to the Verified Petition for Contempt, the Philippine National Police alleged at the outset that it had already ceased from engaging the services of Werfast Documentary Agency as a courier service for delivering firearm license cards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As to the Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection, the Philippine National Police admitted that the paragraph still appeared in the <i>pro forma</i> application form for firearm registration, but asserted that it has stopped implementing warrantless inspections based on the waiver. It had also commenced the printing of new <i>pro forma</i> applications without the Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection. Lastly, the Philippine National Police denied that it refused to open its regional offices.

The government, through the Philippine National Police, counters that the keeping and bearing of arms is a mere privilege, not a right. Thus, whoever seeks to obtain a firearm license has to either accept or decline the government's terms for the use and possession of a firearm.<br><br>The Petitions are partly granted. Section 9.3 of the 2013 Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 10591 is unconstitutional. It is declared void for violating Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution on the right against unreasonable searches and seizures. Signing the Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection appearing in the <i>pro forma</i> application form for firearm registration is likewise declared void and of no force and effect.<br><br>As for the rest of the assailed provisions of Republic Act No. 10591 and the 2013 Implementing Rules and Regulations, petitioners miserably failed to make a case for their unconstitutionality.<br><br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br><br>Acosta and Dela Paz, petitioners in G.R. No. 211559, did not allege actual facts in their Petition. As such, they failed to bring an actual case or controversy before this Court.<br><br>Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution requires an actual case or controversy for this Court's exercise of its power of judicial review:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.</blockquote>There is an actual case or controversy if it involves "a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The issues presented should be "definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Such is necessary for this Court to avoid giving advisory opinions, using its limited resources to resolve hypothetical cases or conjectural issues instead of properly devoting time to the more pressing and important cases for its resolution.<br><br>Actual facts, as opposed to hypothetical ones, must exist for there to be an actual case or controversy. In <i>Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Petitions were dismissed for lack of actual facts. In that case, the petitioners assailed the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9372, or the Human Security Act, alleging that they were subjected to "close security surveillance by state security forces"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and were branded as "enemies of the [S]tate"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> on the basis of the law. This Court held that there were no actual facts for it to decide the consolidated cases as the allegations were unsubstantiated and, therefore, not "anchored on real events[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>When this Court dismissed the <i>Southern Hemisphere</i> petitions, petitions for declaratory relief assailing the constitutionality of the Human Security Act were pending before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The Republic of the Philippines, who was the respondent in the declaratory relief cases, filed a motion to dismiss before the trial court. The motion, however, was denied, leading the Republic of the Philippines to file a petition for certiorari before this Court. In granting the writ of certiorari, this Court in <i>Republic v. Roque</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> stated that the petitions for declaratory relief did not properly allege a "state of facts indicating imminent and inevitable litigation":<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><blockquote>Pertinently, a justiciable controversy refers to an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for judicial determination, not one that is conjectural or merely anticipatory. Corollary thereto, by "ripening seeds" it is meant, not that sufficient accrued facts may be dispensed with, but that a dispute may be tried at its inception before it has accumulated the asperity, distemper, animosity, passion, and violence of a full blown battle that looms ahead. The concept describes a state of facts indicating imminent and inevitable litigation provided that the issue is not settled and stabilized by tranquilizing declaration.<br><br>A perusal of private respondents' petition for declaratory relief would show that they have failed to demonstrate how they are left to sustain or are in immediate danger to sustain some direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the assailed provisions of RA 9372. Not far removed from the factual milieu in the <i>Southern Hemisphere</i> cases, private respondents only assert general interests as citizens, and taxpayers and infractions which the government could prospectively commit if the enforcement of the said law would remain [untrammeled]. As their petition would disclose, private respondents' fear of prosecution was solely based on remarks of certain government officials which were addressed to the general public. They, however, failed to show how these remarks tended towards any prosecutorial or goverrnmental action geared towards the implementation of RA 9372 against them. In other words, there was no particular, real or imminent threat to any of them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote>Recently, in <i>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> this Court dismissed the petition filed by associations of provincial bus operators assailing the constitutionality of Department Order No. 118-12, which mandated the part­ fixed-part-performance-based compensation system for bus drivers and conductors. The petitioners alleged, first, that the compensation scheme "may [result] in [the] diminution of the income of ... bus drivers and conductors."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It also claimed that the compensation scheme was "unfit to the nature of operation of public transport system or business."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In dismissing the Petition, this Court found the petitioners' allegations unsubstantiated and bare, with no actual facts to support them. Reiterating that actual facts must support petitions brought under the expanded jurisdiction of this Court in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution, this Court stated:<br><blockquote>Even the expanded jurisdiction of this Court under Article VIII, Section 1 does not provide license to provide advisory opinions. An advisory opinion is one where the factual setting is conjectural or hypothetical. In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity. They will bind the future parties who may have more motives to choose specific legal arguments. In other words, for there to be a real conflict between the parties, <i>there must exist actual facts from which courts can properly determine whether there has been a breach of constitutional text</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</blockquote>Like the petitions in <i>Southern Hemisphere, Roque</i>, and <i>The Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines</i>, the Petition in G.R. No. 211559 alleges no actual facts from which this Court can intelligently adjudicate the issues raised in it. Petitioners Acosta and Dela Paz assail the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 10591 because it allegedly violated their right to bear arms, their right to property, and even the right to presumption of innocence by disqualifying from holding a firearm license those who have committed a crime involving a firearm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> However, they did not show that their firearm licenses were revoked because of any of the provisions of the law or its Implementing Rules and Regulations.<br><br>Petitioners Acosta and Dela Paz also raise the issue of the omission of engineers from Section 7.3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of the Implementing Rules and Regulations as professionals who may apply for a permit to carry firearms outside of residence, contrary to Section 7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> of Republic Act No. 10591. They also assail Section 7.9<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of the Implementing Rules and Regulations, which allegedly adversely affect members of a law enforcement agency such as the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police.

In other words, the association should show special reasons for bringing the action themselves rather than as a class suit, allowed when the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons. In a class suit, a number of the members of the class are permitted to sue and to defend for the benefit of all the members so long as they are sufficiently numerous and representative of the class to which they belong.<br><br>In some circumstances similar to those in <i>White Light</i>, the third parties represented by the petitioner would have special and legitimate reasons why they may not bring the action themselves. Understandably, the cost to patrons in the <i>White Light</i> case to bring the action themselves-<i>i.e.</i>, the amount they would pay for the lease of the motels-will be too small compared with the cost of the suit. But viewed in another way, whoever among the patrons files the case even for its transcendental interest endows benefits on a substantial number of interested parties without recovering their costs. This is the free rider problem in economics. It is a negative externality which operates as a disincentive to sue and assert a transcendental right.<br><br>In addition to an actual controversy, special reasons to represent, and disincentives for the injured party to bring the suit themselves, there must<br>be a showing of the transcendent nature of the right involved.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Only constitutional rights shared by many and requiring a grounded level of urgency can be transcendent....<br></blockquote><blockquote><br>This Court is not a forum to appeal political and policy choices made by the Executive, Legislative, and other constitutional agencies and organs.

They are likewise competent to determine issues of law which may include the validity of an ordinance, statute, or even an executive issuance in relation to the Constitution. To effectively perform these functions, they are territorially organized into regions and then into branches. Their writs generally reach within those territorial boundaries. Necessarily, they mostly perform the all-important task of inferring the facts from the evidence as these are physically presented before them. In many instances, the facts occur within their territorial jurisdiction, which properly present the 'actual case' that makes ripe a determination of the constitutionality of such action. The consequences, of course, would be national in scope. There are, however, some cases where resort to courts at their level would not be practical considering their decisions could still be appealed before the higher courts, such as the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals is primarily designated as an appellate court that reviews the determination of facts and law made by the trial courts.

Department of Transportation and Communications</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> this Court extensively discussed the evolution of this Court's original and concurrent jurisdiction which eventually led to the development of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. This Court then determined that the doctrine is, ultimately, a "constitutional filtering mechanism designed to enable the Court to focus on the more fundamental and essential tasks assigned to it by the highest law of the land":<br><blockquote>Strict adherence to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is an effective mechanism to filter the cases which reach the Court. As of December 31, 2016, 6,526 new cases were filed to the Court. Together with the reinstated/revived/reopened cases, the Court has a total of 14,491 cases in its docket. Of the new cases, 300 are raffled to the Court En Banc and 6,226 to the three Divisions of the Court. The Court En Banc disposed of 105 cases by decision or signed resolution, while the Divisions of the Court disposed of a total of 923 by decision or signed resolution.<br><br>These, clearly, are staggering numbers. The Constitution provides that the Court has original jurisdiction over five extraordinary writs and by our rule-making power, we created four more writs which can be filed directly before us. There is also the matter of appeals brought to us from the decisions of lower courts. Considering the immense backlog facing the court, this begs the question: <i>What is really the Court's work? What sort of cases deserves the Court's attention and time?</i><br><br>We restate the words of Justice Jose P. Laurel in Angara that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the Constitution. Hence, direct recourse to us should be allowed only when the issue involved is one of law. However, and as former Associate Justice Vicente V. Mendoza reminds, the Court may still choose to avoid passing upon constitutional questions which are confessedly within its jurisdiction if there is some other ground on which its decision may be based. The so-called "seven pillars of limitations of judicial review" or the "rules of avoidance" enunciated by US Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in his concurring opinion in <i>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority</i> teaches that:<br><blockquote>1. The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary proceeding, declining because to decide such questions "is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act."<br><br>2. The Court will not "anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case."<br><br>3. The Court will not "formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied."<br><br>4. The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question, although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.<br><br>5. The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right of challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. Thus, the challenge by a public official interested only in the performance of his official duty will not be entertained. In <i>Fairchild v. Hughes</i>, the Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit brought by a citizen who sought to have the Nineteenth Amendment declared unconstitutional. In <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon</i>, the challenge of the federal Maternity Act was not entertained although made by the Commonwealth on behalf of all its citizens.<br><br>6. The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.<br><br>7. "When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided." ...<br></blockquote>Meanwhile, in <i>Francisco, Jr. v. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Filipino, Inc.</i>, the Court summarized the foregoing "pillars" into six categories and adopted "parallel guidelines" in the exercise of its power of judicial review, to wit:<br><blockquote>The foregoing "pillars" of limitation of judicial review, summarized in <i>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority</i> from different decisions of the United States Supreme Court, can be encapsulated into the following categories:<br><ol><li>that there be absolute necessity of deciding a case<br><br></li><li>that rules of constitutional law shall be formulated only as required by the facts of the case<br><br></li><li>that judgment may not be sustained on some other ground<br><br></li><li>that there be actual injury sustained by the party by reason of the operation of the statute<br><br></li><li>that the parties are not in estoppel<br><br></li><li>that the Court upholds the presumption of constitutionality.<br></li></ol>As stated previously, parallel guidelines have been adopted by this Court in the exercise of judicial review:<br><ol><li>actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power;<br><br></li><li>the person challenging the act must have "standing" to challenge; he must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement;<br><br></li><li>the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity;<br><br></li><li>the issue of constitutionality must be the very <i>lis mota</i> of the case.</li></ol></blockquote>Thus, the exercise of our power of judicial review is subject to these four requisites and the further requirement that we can only resolve pure questions of law. These limitations, when properly and strictly observed, should aid in the decongestion of the Court's workload.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, to assail the constitutionality of some of the provisions of Republic Act No. 10591 and their corresponding provisions in the 2013 Implementing Rules and Regulations, petitioners filed actions for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus-actions that could have been brought before a regional trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>In <i>Ynot v.

Under Republic Act No. 6975, or the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990, the authority to issue licenses for the possession of firearms and explosives is now exclusively granted to the Philippine National Police.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> This was extensively discussed in <i>Chavez</i>:<br><blockquote>It is true that under our constitutional system, the powers of government are distributed among three coordinate and substantially independent departments: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. Each has exclusive cognizance of the matters within its jurisdiction and is supreme within its own sphere.<br><br>Pertinently, the power to make laws-the legislative power-is vested in Congress. Congress may not escape its duties and responsibilities by delegating that power to any other body or authority. Any attempt to abdicate the power is unconstitutional and void, on the principle that "<i>delegata potestas non potest delegari</i>" - "delegated power may not be delegated."<br><br><i>The rule which forbids the delegation of legislative power, however, is not absolute and inflexible.</i> It admits of exceptions. An exception sanctioned by immemorial practice permits the legislative body to delegate its licensing power to certain persons, municipal corporations, towns, boards, councils, commissions, commissioners, auditors, bureaus and directors. Such licensing power includes the power to promulgate necessary rules and regulations.<br><br>The evolution of our laws on firearms shows that since the early days of our Republic, the legislature's tendency was always towards the delegation of power. Act No. 1780, delegated upon the Governor-General (now the President) the authority (<i>1</i>) to approve or disapprove applications of any person for a license to deal in firearms or to possess the same for personal protection, hunting and other lawful purposes; and (<i>2</i>) to revoke such license any time. Further, it authorized him to issue regulations which he may deem necessary for the proper enforcement of the Act. With the enactment of Act No. 2711, the "Revised Administrative Code of 1917," the laws on firearms were integrated. The Act retained the authority of the Governor General provided in Act No. 1780. Subsequently, the growing complexity in the Office of the Governor-General resulted in the delegation of his authority to the Chief of the Constabulary. On January 21, 1919, Acting Governor-General Charles E. Yeater issued Executive Order No. 8 authorizing and directing the Chief of Constabulary to act on his behalf <i>in approving and disapproving applications for personal, special and hunting licenses</i>. This was followed by Executive Order No. 61 designating the Philippine Constabulary (PC) as the government custodian of all firearms, ammunitions and explosives. Executive Order No. 215, issued by President Diosdado Macapagal on December 3, 1965, granted the Chief of the Constabulary, not only the authority to approve or disapprove applications for personal, special and hunting license, but also <i>the authority to revoke the same</i>. With the foregoing developments, it is accurate to say that the Chief of the Constabulary had exercised the authority for a long time. In fact, subsequent issuances such as Sections 2 and 3 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Presidential Decree No. 1866 perpetuate such authority of the Chief of the Constabulary. Section 2 specifically provides that any person or entity desiring to possess any firearm "<i>shall first secure the necessary permit/license/authority from the Chief of the Constabulary</i>." With regard to the issuance of PTCFOR, Section 3 imparts: "<i>The Chief of Constabulary may, in meritorious cases as determined by him and under such conditions as he may impose, authorize lawful holders of firearms to carry them outside of residence</i>." These provisions are issued pursuant to the general power granted by P.D. No. 1866 <i>empowering him to promulgate rules and regulations for the effective implementation of the decree</i>. At this juncture, it bears emphasis that P.D. No. 1866 is the chief law governing possession of firearms in the Philippines and that it was issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the exercise of his legislative power.<br><br>....<br><br>By virtue of Republic Act No. 6975, the Philippine National Police (PNP) absorbed the Philippine Constabulary (PC). Consequently, the PNP Chief succeeded the Chief of the Constabulary and, therefore, assumed the latter's licensing authority. <i>Section 24 thereof specifies, as one of PNP's powers, the issuance of licenses for the possession of firearms and explosives in accordance with law.</i> This is in conjunction with the PNP Chiefs "power to issue detailed implementing policies and instructions" on such "matters as may be necessary to effectively carry out the functions, powers and duties" of the PNP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote>Under Republic Act No. 10591, the authority to issue firearms licenses and permits to carry them outside of residence remains with the Philippine National Police. Section 44 specifically authorized the Chief of the Philippine National Police to promulgate the necessary rules and regulations to effectively implement the law:<br><blockquote>SECTION 44. <i>Implementing Rules and Regulations</i>. - Within one hundred twenty (120) days from the effectivity of this Act, the Chief of the PNP, after public hearings and consultation with concerned sectors of society, shall formulate the necessary rules and regulations for the effective implementation of this Act to be published in at least two (2) national newspapers of general circulation.<br></blockquote>Still, to validly exercise their quasi-legislative powers, administrative agencies must comply with two (2) tests: (1) the completeness test; and (2) the sufficient standard test.<br><br>The completeness test requires that the law to be implemented be "complete [and should set forth] therein the policy to be executed, carried out or implemented by the delegate."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> On the other hand, the sufficient standard test requires that the law to be implemented contain "adequate guidelines ... to map out the boundaries of the delegate's authority[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> "To be sufficient, the standard must specify the limits of the delegate's authority, announce the legislative policy[,] and identify the conditions under which it is to be implemented."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Furthermore, the Administrative Code requires that administrative agencies file with the University of the Philippines Law Center the rules they adopt, which will then be effective 15 days after filing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Since Congress expressly granted the Chief of the Philippine National Police the power to issue rules and regulations to implement Republic Act No. 10591, the fundamental issue to be resolved by this Court is whether the Chief of Police validly exercised this quasi-legislative power in light of the completeness and sufficient standard tests.<br><br><center><b>IV(A)</b><br></center><br>Petitioner PROGUN argues that the Implementing Rules and Regulations is an <i>ex post facto</i> law-a law that makes criminal an act done before its passage but innocent at the time of its commission<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup>-the enactment of which is prohibited in Article III, Section 22 of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> According to petitioner PROGUN, the Philippine National Police deemed vacated all firearm licenses issued under the old law, forcing existing license holders to re-apply under the new law under pain of being charged for illegal possession of firearms.

The State also recognizes <i>the right of its qualified citizens to self-defense through, when it is the reasonable means to repel the unlawful aggression under the circumstances, the use of firearms</i>. Towards this end, the State shall provide for a comprehensive law regulating the ownership, possession, carrying, manufacture, dealing in and importation of firearms, ammunition, or parts thereof, in order to provide legal support to law enforcement agencies in their campaign against crime, stop the proliferation of illegal firearms or weapons and the illegal manufacture of firearms or weapons, ammunition and parts thereof. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Section 2 recognizes that the right to self-defense is provided as a justifying circumstance under the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> However, this right to self-defense, if it is to be done through the use of firearms, is granted to "qualified citizens": those who have satisfied the qualifications for obtaining a license to own and possess firearms under Republic Act No. 10591. Therefore, even with the new law, the exercise of the right to use a firearm, even for self-defense, is still subject to State regulation.<br><br>Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the right to possess a firearm were considered a property right, it is doctrine that property rights are always subject to the State's police power, defined as the "authority to enact legislation that may interfere with personal liberty or property in order to promote the general welfare."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>As early as 1914, this Court has held that the use of deadly weapons such as a firearm is subject to police power.

Also discussed were the fundamental reasons, reasons that still hold today, for the regulation of firearms "to increase the security of life and limb"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> and "to suppress crime and lawlessness":<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><blockquote>Counsel's contention seems to be based on those provisions of the Philippine Bill of Rights which prohibit the enactment of a law depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or denying to any person the equal protection of the laws. He insists that restrictions placed on the carrying of deadly weapons have the effect of depriving the owner of the free use and enjoyment of his property, and that the granting of licenses to some persons to carry firearms and the denial of that right to others is a denial to the latter of the equal protection of the laws.<br><br>Both the statute in question and the provision of the Philippine Bill of Rights with which it is claimed it is in conflict were enacted under American sovereignty, and both are to be construed more especially in the light of American authority and precedent. The earliest English statute (St. 2 Edw. III, c. 3) regulating the bearing of arms, enacted in the year 1328 A. D., was but an affirmation of the common law offense of going around with unusual and dangerous weapons to the terror of the people. Many statutes have been enacted since that time in England and the United States, regulating the carrying and the use of weapons, and these have, as a rule, been held to be constitutional, especially when the prohibitions have been directed to the wearing or carrying of deadly weapons in a concealed manner. (See 48 Cent. Digest, tit. Weapons, and, many cases there cited.)<br><br>There can be no real question as to the police power of the state to regulate the use of deadly weapons for the purpose of suppressing or restraining crime and lawlessness. Undoubtedly there are many deadly weapons, such as knives, bolos, krises and the like which every citizen has a right to own and to use in the various activities of human life. But the right to own and to, use such weapons does not carry with it the right to use them to the injury of his neighbor or so as to endanger the peace and welfare of the community. "It is a settled principle, growing out of the nature of well-ordered civil society, that every holder of property, however absolute and unqualified may be his title, holds it under his implied liability that his use of it may be so regulated that it shall not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having an equal right to the enjoyment of their property, nor injurious to the rights of the community." [(]<i>Com. vs. Alger, 7 Cush. (Mass.), 53, 84.) Provided the means adopted are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the end in view, not unduly oppressive upon individuals, and in the interest of the public generally rather than of a particular class, the legislature may adopt such regulations as it deems proper restricting, limiting, and regulating the use of private property in the exercise of its police power. (U S. vs. Toribio, 15 Phil. Rep., 85.)</i><br><br>We think there can be no question as to the reasonableness of a statutory regulation prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons as a police measure well calculated to restrict the too frequent resort to such weapons in moments of anger and excitement. We do not doubt that the strict enforcement of such a regulation would tend to increase the security of life and limb, and to suppress crime and lawlessness, in any community wherein the practice of carrying concealed weapons prevails, and this without being unduly oppressive upon the individual owners of these weapons. It follows that its enactment by the legislature is a proper and legitimate exercise of the police power of the state.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> (Emphasis in the<br>original)</blockquote>In <i>Chavez</i>, this Court reiterated that "laws regulating the acquisition or possession of guns have frequently been upheld as reasonable exercise of the police power."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>This Court likewise discussed the test to determine the validity of a police power measure: (1) "[t]he interests of the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, require the exercise of the police power";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> and (2) "[t]he means employed are reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not unduly oppressive upon individuals."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>Applying this test, this Court found that the Philippine National Police Guidelines, which suspended the issuance of permits to carry firearms outside of residence, was a valid police power measure. It held that the interest of the general public was satisfied, since the Guidelines was issued in response to the rise in high-profile crimes. As to the means employed to retain peace and order in society, this Court stated that the revocation of all permits to carry firearms outside of residence would make it difficult for criminals to commit gun violence and victimize others. This Court, thus, deemed the regulation reasonable:<br><blockquote>It is apparent from the assailed Guidelines that the basis for its issuance was the need for peace and order in the society. Owing to the proliferation of crimes, particularly those committed by the New People's Army (NPA), which tends to disturb the peace of the community, President Arroyo deemed it best to impose a nationwide gun ban. Undeniably, the motivating factor in the issuance of the assailed Guidelines is the interest of the public in general.<br><br>The only question that can then arise is whether the means employed are appropriate and reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and are not unduly oppressive. In the instant case, the assailed Guidelines do not entirely prohibit possession of firearms. What they proscribe is merely the carrying of firearms outside of residence. However, those who wish to carry their firearms outside of their residences may re­apply for a new PTCFOR. This we believe is a reasonable regulation. If the carrying of firearms is regulated, necessarily, crime incidents will be curtailed. Criminals carry their weapon to hunt for their victims; they do not wait in the comfort of their homes. With the revocation of all PTCFOR, it would be difficult for criminals to roam around with their guns. On the other hand, it would be easier for the PNP to apprehend them.<br><br>Notably, laws regulating the acquisition or possession of guns have frequently been upheld as reasonable exercise of the police power. In <i>State vs. Reams</i>, it was held that the legislature may regulate the right to bear arms in a manner conducive to the public peace. With the promotion of public peace as its objective and the revocation of all PTCFOR as the means, we are convinced that the issuance of the assailed Guidelines constitutes a reasonable exercise of police power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Like the assailed Guidelines in <i>Chavez</i>, Republic Act No. 10591, which regulates the use of firearms, is a valid police power measure. The maintenance of peace and order and the protection of people from violence are not only for the good of the general public; they are fundamental duties of the State, the fulfillment of which strengthens its legitimacy. The means employed to fulfill these State duties-requiring a license for the ownership and possession of firearms and a permit to carry the weapon outside of residence-are reasonably necessary. As discussed, licenses to operate firearms have been required under the old firearms laws. For Congress, stricter gun laws are effective in reducing gun-related violence.<br><br>The following provisions assailed by petitioners are consistent with these general interests of maintaining peace and order and protecting the people from violence. Section 4(g) of Republic Act No. 10591 and its corresponding provision in the Implementing Rules and Regulations, Section 4.4(a), both require that an applicant for a firearm license has not been convicted or is currently an accused in a pending criminal case punished with imprisonment for more than two (2) years: <br><blockquote>&nbsp; <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Republic Act No. 10591</strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Implementing Rules (2013)</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">SECTION 4. <em>Standards and Requisites for Issuance of and Obtaining a License to Own and Possess Firearms</em>. - In order to qualify and acquire a license to own and possess a firearm or firearms and ammunition, the applicant must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-­one (21) years old and has gainful work, occupation or business or has filed an Income Tax Return (ITR) for the preceding year as proof of income, profession, business or occupation.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;In addition, the applicant shall submit the following certification issued by appropriate authorities attesting the following:</div><br>&nbsp; <div align="justify">....<br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; (g) The applicant has not been convicted or is currently an accused in a pending criminal case before any court of law for a crime that is punishable with a penalty of more than two (2) years.&nbsp; </div><br>&nbsp; <div align="justify">For purposes of this Act, an acquittal or permanent dismissal of a criminal case before the courts of law shall qualify the accused thereof to qualify and acquire a license.</div><br>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify">SECTION 4. <em>Standards Requisites for Issuance of and Obtaining a License to Own and Possess Firearms</em>. - ....</div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">....</div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">4.4 The written application to own and possess firearm/s shall be filed at the FEO, in three (3) legible copies duly notarized, and must be accompanied by the original copy of the following requirements:</div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">a) Clearances issued by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and Municipal/Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) that has jurisdiction over the place where the applicant resides and/or the Sandiganbayan as the case may be, showing that he/she has not been convicted by final judgment of a crime involving moral turpitude or that he/she has not been convicted or is currently an accused in any pending criminal case before any court of law for a crime that is punishable with a penalty of more than two (2) years[.]</div><div align="justify"><br></div><div align="justify"><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Contrary to petitioners Acosta and Dela Paz's argument, these provisions do not violate the constitutional guarantee to presumption of innocence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> Congress restricted the privilege to apply for a firearm from convicts and those currently accused in a pending criminal case punished with imprisomnent for more than two (2) years, since a <i>prima facie</i> finding of an applicant's guilt indicates his or her propensity to violate the law. If Republic Act No. 10591 is to function as a preventive measure against gun violence, then it is prudent to prohibit those who, during the preliminary investigation stage, were found probably guilty of an offense.

Unlike small arms, which are incapable of fully automatic bursts of discharge,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> Class-A light weapons are self­-loading, entirely capable of inflicting multiple injuries on others. Thus, consistent with its declared policy in Republic Act No. 10591, the State balanced its interests to, on the one hand, keep violence at a minimum, and on the other, grant the right of the people to self-defense.<br><br>The use of a small arm to defend oneself is, for the State, that which is reasonably necessary to repel the unlawful aggression. As for the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police, and other law enforcement agencies, their duties to maintain peace and order and protect the public allow for the use of Class-A light weapons. This Court agrees with respondents when they argued that:<br><blockquote>... Section 10 of RA 10591 is a legitimate exercise of police power by the State. In the wrong hands, Class-A Light Weapons, with their capability to inflict multiple injuries to a large number of people at a rate several times faster than small arms, are highly destructive instruments and pose serious threats to public safety.

Section 26 of Republic Act No. 10591 and its equivalent provision in the Implementing Rules and Regulations state:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Republic Act No. 10591</strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>&nbsp;Implementing Rules (2013)</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">SECTION 26. <em>Death or Disability of Licensee</em>. - Upon the death or legal disability of the holder of a firearm license, it shall be the duty of his/her next of kin, nearest relative, legal representative, or other person who shall knowingly come into possession of such firearm or ammunition, to deliver the same to the FEO of the PNP or Police Regional Office, and such firearm or ammunition shall be retained by the police custodian pending the issuance of a license and its registration in accordance with this Act.

These qualifications may not be possessed by his or her relative or next of kin. It is, therefore, only correct that the rights to own and possess a firearm are non-transferrable by succession. At any rate, should he or she be interested, the deceased's relative or next of kin may apply for a license to own and possess the deceased's registered firearm under Section 26 of Republic Act No. 10591. As argued by respondents:<br><blockquote>. . . Article 776 of the Civil Code specifically provides that inheritance includes all the property, rights and obligations of a person which are not extinguished by his death. Thus, what the heirs can only inherit are the rights which are not extinguished by the decedent's death. Since the license to own and possess a firearm is only a privilege and is strictly personal to the firearm license holder, it is therefore not transmissible to the heirs of the former. In addition, they cannot interpret said provision so as to include practically everything owned by the decedent. Common sense dictates that things, articles, and belongings which are highly regulated and are prohibited by law such as contraband and drugs or those that have been already removed from private ownership, like Class-A light weapons, cannot be transmitted to the heirs by operation of law. If their interpretation is to be accepted, then a ridiculous situation would arise wherein the heirs, without intending to violate the applicable law, would be indiscriminately subjected to criminal prosecution for illegal possession of a firearm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup></blockquote>As to the automatic revocation of license if the registered firearm is used for the commission of a crime, Section 39(a) of Republic Act No. 10591 and its corresponding provision in the Implementing Rules and Regulations state: <br><blockquote>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Republic Act No. 10591 </strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Implementing Rules (2013)</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">SECTION 39. <em>Grounds for <br>&nbsp;Revocation, Cancellation or Suspension of License or Permit</em>. -</div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">The Chief of the PNP or his/her authorized representative <br>may revoke, cancel or suspend a license or permit on the following grounds:</div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">(a) Commission of a crime or offense involving the firearm, ammunition, of major parts thereof[.]</div></td><td><div align="justify">SECTION 39. <em>Grounds for <br>&nbsp;Revocation, Cancellation or Suspension of License or Permit</em>. - </div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">39.1 The Chief, PNP or his/her <br>authorized representative may revoke, cancel or suspend a <br>license or permit on the following grounds:</div><br>&nbsp;<div align="justify">a) Commission of a crime or offense involving the firearm, ammunition or major parts or pendency of a criminal case involving the firearm, ammunition or major parts thereof[.]</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br>The commission of the crime indicates the licensee's propensity for violence, which is contrary to the declared State policy of maintaining peace and order and protecting the people from violence.

In <i>Saluday</i>, this Court expounded on the requirement of legitimate expectation of privacy, which originated from <i>Katz v. United States</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup><br><blockquote>Indeed, the constitutional guarantee is not a blanket prohibition. Rather, it operates against "unreasonable" searches and seizures only. Conversely, <b>when a search is "reasonable," Section 2, Article III of the Constitution does not apply</b>. As to what qualifies as a reasonable search, the pronouncements of the U.S. Supreme Court, which are doctrinal in this jurisdiction, may shed light on the matter.<br><br>In the seminal case of <i>Katz v. United States</i>, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the electronic surveillance of a phone conversation without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. According to the U.S. Supreme Court, what the Fourth Amendment protects are people, not places such that what a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his or her own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection in much the same way that what he or she seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected, thus:<br><blockquote>Because of the misleading way the issues have been formulated, the parties have attached great significance to the characterization of the telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his calls. The petitioner has strenuously argued that the booth was a "constitutionally protected area." The Government has maintained with equal vigor that it was not. But this effort to decide whether or not a given "area," viewed in the abstract, is "constitutionally protected" deflects attention from the problem presented by this case. For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. <b>What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.</b> <i>See Lewis v. United States</i>, 385 U.S. 206, 210; <i>United States v. Lee</i>, 274 U.S. 559, 563. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected. <i>See Rios v. United States</i>, 364 U.S. 253; <i>Ex parte Jackson</i>, 96 U.S. 727, 733....</blockquote>Further, Justice John Harlan laid down in his concurring opinion the two-part test that would trigger the application of the Fourth Amendment. <i>First</i>, a person exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy. <i>Second</i>, the expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable (objective).<br><br>The prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure ultimately stems from a person's right to privacy. Hence, only when the State intrudes into a person's expectation of privacy, which society regards as reasonable, is the Fourth Amendment triggered. Conversely, where a person does not have an expectation of privacy or one's expectation of privacy is not reasonable to society, the alleged State intrusion is not a "search" within the protection of the Fourth Amendment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote>A reduced expectation of privacy is the reason why the inspection of persons and their effects under routine inspections, such as those done in airports, seaports, bus terminals, malls, and similar public places, does not require a search warrant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> These routine inspections are considered reasonable searches, clearly done to ensure public safety.<br><br>A reasonable search, however, is different from a warrantless search. While a reasonable search arises from a reduced expectation of privacy, a warrantless search, which is presumed unreasonable, dispenses with a search warrant for practical reasons.

There is a legitimate, almost absolute, expectation of privacy in one's residence.<br><br>Indeed, the oft-cited remark of William Pitt, an English statesman and later on Prime Minister of England, rings true up to this day despite having been made more than three (3) centuries ago:<br><blockquote>The poorest man may, in his cottage, bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter, but the King of England may not enter; all his force dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup></blockquote>Article 10 of the Malolos Constitution of 1899 even provided that, save for some exceptions, "[N]o one shall enter the dwelling house of any Filipino or a foreigner residing in the Philippines without his consent":<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 10. No one shall enter the dwelling house of any Filipino or a foreigner residing in the Philippines without his consent, except in urgent cases of fire, inundation, earthquake or other similar danger, or by reason of unlawful aggression from within, or in order to assist a person therein who cries for help.<br><br>Outside of these cases, the entry into the dwelling house of any Filipino or foreigner resident in the Philippines or the search of his papers and effects can only be decreed by a competent court and executed only in the daytime.<br><br>The search of papers and effects shall be made always in the presence of the person searched or of a member of his family and, in their absence, of two witnesses resident of the same place.<br><br>However, when a criminal caught <i>in fraganti</i> should take refuge in his dwelling house, the authorities in pursuit may enter into it, only for the purpose of making an arrest.<br><br>If the criminal should take refuge in the dwelling house of a foreigner, the consent of the latter must first be obtained.<br></blockquote>The 1904 case of <i>United States v. Arceo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> echoes the principle of "inviolability of the dwelling":<br><blockquote>The inviolability of the house is one of the most fundamental of all the individual rights declared and recognized in the political codes of civilized nations. No one can enter into the home of another without the consent of its owners or occupants.<br><br>The privacy of the home - the place of abode, the place where a man with his family may dwell in peace and enjoy the companionship of his wife and children unmolested by anyone, even the king, except in the rare cases - has always been regarded by civilized nations as one of the most sacred personal rights to which men are entitled. Both the common and the civil law guaranteed to man the right of absolute protection to the privacy of his home. The king was powerful; he was clothed with majesty; his will was the law, but, with few exceptions, the humblest citizen or subject might shut the door of his humble cottage in the face of the monarch and defend his intrusion into that privacy which was regarded as sacred as any of the kingly prerogatives. The poorest and most humble citizen or subject may, in his cottage, no matter how frail or humble it is, bid defiance to all the powers of the state; the wind, the storm and the sunshine alike may enter through its weather-beaten parts, but the king may not enter against its owner's will; none of the forces dare to cross the threshold even the humblest tenement without its owner's consent.<br><br>"A man's house is his castle," has become a maxim among the civilized peoples of the earth.

The consent must be voluntary in order to validate an otherwise illegal detention and search, <i>i.e.</i>, the consent is unequivocal, specific, and intelligently given, uncontaminated by any duress or coercion. Hence, consent to a search is not to be lightly inferred, but must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. The question whether a consent to a search was in fact voluntary is a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances. Relevant to this determination are the following characteristics of the person giving consent and the environment in which consent is given: (1) the age of the defendant; (2) whether he was in a public or secluded location; (3) whether he objected to the search or passively looked on; (4) the education and intelligence of the defendant; (5) the presence of coercive police procedures; (6) the defendant's belief that no incriminating evidence will be found; (7) the nature of the police questioning; (8) the environment in which the questioning took place; and (9) the possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person consenting. It is the State which has the burden of proving, by clear and positive testimony, that the necessary consent was obtained and that it was freely and voluntarily given.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>In requiring a waiver in the <i>pro forma</i> Individual Application for New Firearm Registration, the Philippine National Police appears to recognize the inviolability of the home. Nevertheless, signing the Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection does <i>not</i> result in a true and valid consented search.<br><br>Section 9 of Republic Act No. 10591 provides that applicants for Types 3 to 5 licenses "must comply with the inspection ... requirements." However, the law is silent as to the scope, frequency, and execution of the inspection. This means that the Chief of the Philippine National Police is presumed to fill in these details in the Implementing Rules and Regulations. However, even the Implementing Rules is completely silent as to the parameters of the inspection.

This led to the conviction of its owner who, for refusing entry to the inspector, was found to have violated Baltimore's Health Code.<br><br>In <i>Frank</i>, the United States Supreme Court recognized the necessity of warrantless inspections to ensure compliance with laws. It noted that "[i]nspection[s] without a warrant, as an adjunct to a regulatory scheme for the general welfare of the community and not as a means of enforcing the criminal law,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> are valid, having "antecedents deep in ... history."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> As to a possible violation of the right to privacy, the United States High Court stated that warrantless inspections "only... touch, at most, upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against official intrusion":<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup><br><blockquote>The attempted inspection of appellant's home is merely to determine whether conditions exist which the Baltimore Health Code proscribes. If they do, appellant is notified to remedy the infringing conditions. No evidence for criminal prosecution is sought to be seized. Appellant is simply directed to do what he could have been ordered to do without any inspection, and what he cannot properly resist, namely, act in a manner consistent with the maintenance of minimum community standards of health and well being, including his own. Appellant's resistance can only be based not on admissible self-protection, but on a rarely voiced denial of any official justification for seeking to enter his home. The constitutional "liberty" that is asserted is the absolute right to refuse consent for an inspection designed and pursued solely for the protection of the community's health, even when the inspection is conducted with due regard for every convenience of time and place.<br><br>The power of inspection granted by the Baltimore City Code is strictly limited, more exacting than the analogous provisions of many other municipal codes. Valid grounds for suspicion of the existence of a nuisance must exist. Certainly the presence of a pile of filth in the back yard combined with the rundown condition of the house gave adequate grounds for such suspicion. The inspection must be made in the daytime. Here was no midnight knock on the door, but an orderly visit in the middle of the afternoon with no suggestion that the hour was inconvenient. Moreover, the inspector has no power to force entry and did not attempt it. A fine is imposed for resistance, but officials are not authorized to break past the unwilling occupant.<br><br>Thus, not only does the inspection touch, at most, upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against official intrusion, but it is hedged about with safeguards designed to make the least possible demand on the individual occupant, and to cause only the slightest restriction on his claims of privacy. Such a demand must be assessed in the light of the needs which have produced it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup></blockquote><i>Frank</i> was overturned in <i>Camara v. Municipal Court</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> In the latter case, a municipal health inspector entered an apartment building to determine compliance with the San Francisco Housing Code. During the inspection, the building manager informed the inspector that Ronald Camara (Camara), the person leasing the building's ground floor, used part of the property as his residence. The inspector, claiming that the ground floor could not be used as a residence based on the building's occupancy permit, demanded entry to the property. Camara refused the inspector entry as no search warrant was presented.<br><br>When the inspector returned two (2) days later, still unarmed with a warrant, Camara again refused him entry. A citation to appear before the district attorney's office and the return of two (2) more inspectors after, Camara still did not let the inspectors into the leased property for lack of a search warrant. Camara was eventually charged with a criminal complaint for violating the municipal code for refusing to permit a lawful inspection.<br><br>In <i>Camara</i>, the United States Supreme Court conceded that the "translation of the abstract prohibition against 'unreasonable searches and seizures' into workable guidelines for the decision of particular cases is a difficult task which has for many years divided the members of[its] Court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> Still, "except in certain carefully defined classes of cases,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> the United States Supreme Court reiterated that "a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup><br><br>In overturning <i>Frank</i>; the United States Supreme Court recognized in <i>Camara</i> that routine inspections are "less hostile"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup> than a search in relation to a criminal investigation. However, this does not mean that "the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup> or that the privacy interests involved during an inspection are merely "periphera1."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup> For one, "criminal entry under the guise of official sanction is a serious threat to personal and family security."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> Furthermore, in an inspection, the house occupant has no way of knowing its scope and limits, unlike in a search done through the "warrant machinery contemplated by the Fourth Amendment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> Lastly, refusal to grant entry to an inspector may lead to prosecution:<br><blockquote>To the <i>Frank</i> majority, municipal fire, health, and housing inspection programs "touch at most upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment's protection against official intrusion," because the inspections are merely to determine whether physical conditions exist which do not comply with minimum standards prescribed in local regulatory ordinances. Since the inspector does not ask that the property owner open his doors to a search for "evidence of criminal action" which may be used to secure the owner's criminal conviction, historic interests of "self-protection" jointly protected by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments are said not to be involved, but only the less intense "right to be secure from intrusion into personal privacy."<br><br>We may agree that a routine inspection of the physical condition of private property is a less hostile intrusion than the typical policeman's search for the fruits and instrumentalities of crime. For this reason alone, <i>Frank</i> differed from the great bulk of Fourth Amendment cases which have been considered by this Court. But we cannot agree that the Fourth Amendment interests at stake in these inspection cases are merely "peripheral." It is surely anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior. For instance, even the most law-abiding citizen has a very tangible interest in limiting the circumstances under which the sanctity of his home may be broken by official authority, for the possibility of criminal entry under the guise of official sanction is a serious threat to personal and family security. And even accepting <i>Frank's</i> rather remarkable premise, inspections of the kind we are here considering do, in fact, jeopardize "self-protection" interests of the property owner. Like most regulatory laws, fire, health, and housing codes are enforced by criminal processes. In some cities, discovery of a violation by the inspector leads to a criminal complaint. Even in cities where discovery of a violation produces only an administrative compliance order, refusal to comply is a criminal offense, and the fact of compliance is verified by a second inspection, again without a warrant. Finally, as this case demonstrates, refusal to permit an inspection is itself a crime, punishable by fine or even by jail sentence.<br><br>The <i>Frank</i> majority suggested, and appellee reasserts, two other justifications for permitting administrative health and safety inspections without a warrant. First, it is argued that these inspections are "designed to make the least possible demand on the individual occupant." The ordinances authorizing inspections are hedged with safeguards, and at any rate the inspector's particular decision to enter must comply with the constitutional standard of reasonableness even if he may enter without a warrant. In addition, the argument proceeds, the warrant process could not function effectively in this field. The decision to inspect an entire municipal area is based upon legislative or administrative assessment of broad factors such as the area's age and condition. Unless the magistrate is to review such policy matters, he must issue a "rubber stamp" warrant which provides no protection at all to the property owner.<br><br>In our opinion, these arguments unduly discount the purposes behind the warrant machinery contemplated by the Fourth Amendment. Under the present system, when the inspector demands entry, the occupant has no way of knowing whether enforcement of the municipal code involved requires inspection of his premises, no way of knowing the lawful limits of the inspector's power to search, and no way of knowing whether the inspector himself is acting under proper authorization. These are questions which may be reviewed by a neutral magistrate without any reassessment of the basic agency decision to canvass an area. Yet only by refusing entry and risking a criminal conviction can the occupant at present challenge the inspector's decision to search. And even if the occupant possesses sufficient fortitude to take this risk, as appellant did here, he may never learn any more about the reason for the inspection than that the law generally allows housing inspectors to gain entry. The practical effect of this system is to leave the occupant subject to the discretion of the official in the field. This is precisely the discretion to invade private property which we have consistently circumscribed by a requirement that a disinterested party warrant the need to search. We simply cannot say that the protections provided by the warrant procedure are not needed in this context; broad statutory safeguards are no substitute for individualized review, particularly when those safeguards may only be invoked at the risk of a criminal penalty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>The United States Supreme Court further clarified in <i>Camara</i> that there is no question as to the reasonableness of administrative inspections or whether they are done for the common good. The question, rather, should be whether such inspection should be made with a warrant:<br><blockquote>The final justification suggested for warrantless administrative searches is that the public interest demands such a rule: it is vigorously argued that the health and safety of entire urban populations is dependent upon enforcement of minimum fire, housing, and sanitation standards, and that the only effective means of enforcing such codes is by routine systematized inspection of all physical structures. Of course, in applying any reasonableness standard, including one of constitutional dimension, an argument that the public interest demands a particular rule must receive careful consideration. But we think this argument misses the mark. The question is not, at this stage, at least, whether these inspections may be made, but whether they may be made without a warrant. For example, to say that gambling raids may not be made at the discretion of the police without a Warrant is not necessarily to say that gambling raids may never be made. In assessing whether the public interest demands creation of a general exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, the question is not whether the public interest justifies the type of search in question, but whether the authority to search should be evidenced by a warrant, which in turn depends in part upon whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search. It has nowhere been urged that fire, health, and housing code inspection programs could not achieve their goals within the confines of a reasonable search warrant requirement. Thus, we do not find the public need argument dispositive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote>It was held in <i>Camara</i> that a warrantless inspection of a home is deemed reasonable if it involves an emergency situation concerning health and safety.

However, if "there is no compelling urgency to inspect at a particular time or on a particular day[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup> a warrant should "be sought only after entry is refused unless there has been a citizen complaint or there is other satisfactory reason for securing immediate entry."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> Ultimately, the judgment of conviction against Camara was vacated since there was no emergency situation and, therefore, no compelling urgency to enter the property he was renting.<br><br>The United States Supreme Court has given the same protection to owners of private commercial establishments.<br><br>In <i>See v.

The Secretary of Labor appealed the injunction to the United States Supreme Court.<br><br>Affirming the injunction, the United States High Court reiterated the rulings in <i>Camara</i> and <i>See</i> that warrantless inspections of dwellings and business premises are unreasonable, thus requiring a search warrant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> The exception is only for "closely regulated"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> industries "long subject to close supervision and inspection,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> as held in <i>Colonnade</i>. There being no showing that Barlow's line of business had long been subjected to close supervision and inspection, the inspection provision under the Occupational Safety and Health Act was declared unconstitutional.<br><br>In <i>Donovan v. Dewey</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 103(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which allowed the warrantless inspection of underground mines at least four (4) times a year and surface mines at least twice a year. Under the same provision, follow-up inspections are undertaken to determine whether the discovered violations have been rectified.<br><br>In upholding the constitutionality of warrantless inspections of mines, the United States Supreme Court stated that they do not violate the Fourth Amendment. First, it found that there is a substantial governmental interest in improving the health and safety conditions of the States' underground and surface mines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> It declared that mining has had a "notorious history of serious accidents and unhealthful working conditions,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> such that its regulation has been "sufficiently pervasive and defined that the owner of such a facility cannot help but be aware that he 'will be subject to effective inspection.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> Second, the law specifically provided "the standards with which a mine operator is required to comply[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> Third, the Mine Safety and Health Act provided remedies available for possible violations of privacy such as the prohibition on forcible entries.<br><br>Adding that a provision to conduct the inspection "at . . . reasonable times, and within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> is not sufficient, the United States High Court noted that the scope and limits of the inspection must be provided in the law. Ultimately, Section 103(a) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 was upheld constitutional.<br><br>Going back to the case at hand, this Court finds that Section 9 of Republic Act No. 10591 and its corresponding provision in the Implementing Rules are unconstitutional for being violative of Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution.<br><br>Section 9 authorizes warrantless inspections of houses which, as has been extensively discussed, are unreasonable and, therefore, require a search warrant. Furthermore, Section 9 miserably failed to provide the scope and extent of the inspections, making them overbroad. While the State has heavy regulated the use of and dealing in firearms to maintain peace and order, this does not excuse the utter lack of standards for the conduct of inspection. What this does is give unbridled discretion and power to government officials, the very discretion that Article III, Section 2 guards against.<br><br>True, the standard of reasonableness can be found in the law and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. However, "reasonable" as a standard for inspection is not enough. For the waiver of the right against unreasonable searches to be valid, the provision allowing for the inspection must be as informative as to detail its scope and extent.<br><br>Therefore, signing the Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection in the <i>pro forma</i> Individual Application for New Firearm Registration cannot be considered a valid waiver of the right against unreasonable searches under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. The applicant cannot intelligently consent to the warrantless inspection allowed in Republic Act No. 10591 because of the utter lack of parameters on how the inspection shall be conducted.<br><br>This Court notes that the Implementing Rules and Regulations has since been amended in 2018, with its Section 9.3 now providing the scope of the inspection relating to applications for Types 3-5 licenses:<br><blockquote>&nbsp; <br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="47%"><div align="center"><strong>Implementing Rules (2013)</strong></div></td><td width="53%"><div align="center"><strong>Implementing Rules (2018)</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">SECTION 9. <em>Licenses Issued to <br>&nbsp; Individuals</em>. -<br>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp; <div align="justify">....<br><br>&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp; 9.6 For Types 3 to 5 licenses, the licensed citizen must comply with the inspection requirements of thePNP.

Considering that the inspection is done before a license is issued, there is no compelling urgency to immediately conduct the inspection. A search warrant must first be obtained from a judge to determine probable cause for its issuance.<br><br><center><b>VIII</b></center><br>Petitioner PROGUN in G.R.

No. 10591 otherwise known as, "An Act Providing for a Comprehensive Law on Firearms and Ammunition and Providing Penalties for Violations thereof" and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) for allegedly infringing upon their right to bear arms, right to property and right to privacy.<br><br><b><i>Precedence of National Interest over <br>Rule on Technicalities</i></b><br><br>At the outset, the <i>ponencia</i> notes the absence of the requisites for a valid exercise of the Court's power of judicial review, particularly:<br><br>First, there is no actual case or controversy that is ripe for the Court's resolution. The petitioners in G.R. No. 211559 do not allege facts that will confirm the existence of an actual case or controversy to warrant the Court's exercise of its judicial power. As discussed in the <i>ponencia</i>, an actual case or controversy is necessary for the Court to avoid using its time and limited resources in resolving mere hypothetical cases or conjectural issues.<br><br>Next, the petitioners do not have legal standing to file the present suit. Petitioners Eric F. Acosta and Nathaniel G. DelaPaz did not allege that they are engineers, but they raise as issue the omission of engineers in Section 7.3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the IRR of R.A. No. 10591 as professionals who are not required to submit threat assessment certificates in applying for a Permit to Carry Firearms Outside of Residence (PTCFOR). There is also no showing that the petitioners PROGUN and Guns and Ammo Dealers Association of the Philippines were authorized by their members to sue on their behalf. Thus, the absence of legal standing on the part of the petitioners to file the present suit.<br><br>Lastly, the <i>ponencia</i> observes that the petitioners violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts when they directly sought recourse from the Court.<br><br>In spite of the foregoing lapses, I find it striking that the Petitions were not outrightly denied on these procedural grounds; in fact, the <i>ponencia</i> extensively discussed the issues raised by the petitioners. I wish to emphasize that since constitutional rights are involved, technicalities should not impede the resolution of the present consolidated petitions. Indeed, the petitioners' violations are mere procedural technicalities which the Court may set aside in its discretion in the interest of substantial justice. In <i>Chavez v. Hon. Romulo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the Court was confronted with a petition that also sought to enjoin the implementation of guidelines regarding the carrying of firearms outside residence. Despite procedural barriers, the Court treated the matter as one of national interest and of serious implication,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and as such, entertained the petition despite the attendant procedural infirmities. There is no reason why the present case should be dealt with differently.<br><br>Now, with respect to the substantive issues.<br><br><b><i>Invalidity of the Inspection <br>Requirement</i></b><br><br>There is no fundamental right to bear arms in the Philippines, thus, the State may regulate gun ownership through the exercise of its police power. In line with this, I stand with the <i>ponencia</i> in declaring Section 9.6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the IRR of R.A. No. 10591 which was promulgated in 2013 unconstitutional, albeit for a different reason.<br><br>I agree that requiring Types 3 to 5 license applicants to sign the <i>pro forma</i> "Consent of Voluntary Presentation for Inspection" violates Article III, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> but, primarily because there are no sufficient safeguards to carry out the inspection. In <i>Ople v. Torres</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Court held that "the right to privacy does not bar all incursions into individual privacy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, "intrusions into the right must be accompanied by proper safeguards and well-defined standards to prevent unconstitutional invasions. We reiterate that any law or order that invades individual privacy will be subjected by this Court to strict scrutiny."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> rules that even though Section 9.3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the 2018 Revised IRR of R.A. No. 10591 now provides for the scope and extent of the inspection, a search warrant must be first obtained considering that there is no compelling urgency to immediately conduct the inspection.<br><br>Based on Section 9<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of R.A. No. 10591, Types 3 to 5 licenses allow a citizen to own and possess at least six registered firearms. In view of the gravity, responsibility, and possible repercussions of owning and possessing at least six firearms in one's residence, I am of the opinion that the State must still be given an opportunity to ensure compliance with the vault and safety requirements under R.A. No. 10951, and the only way to confirm compliance is through the conduct of an initial, one-time inspection, complemented by a subsequent inspection in case of compelling urgency, as the <i>ponencia</i> suggests.<br><br>In <i>People of the Philippines v. O'Cochlain</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court noted that administrative searches are allowed in certain situations where special needs arise and securing a prior search warrant is rendered impracticable, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>US courts have permitted exceptions to the Fourth Amendment when "special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable cause requirement impracticable" such as work-­related searches of government employees' desks and offices, warrantless searches conducted by school officials of a student's property, government investigators conducting searches pursuant to a regulatory scheme when the searches meet "reasonable legislative or administrative standards," and a State's operation of a probation system. The Fourth Amendment permits the warrantless search of "closely regulated" businesses; "special needs" cases such as schools, employment, and probation; and "checkpoint" searches such as airport screenings under the administrative search doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br>(Citation omitted)</blockquote>From this vantage ground, an inspection prior to the issuance of Types 3 to 5 licenses must be allowed as an adjunct of administrative search, owing to the weight of responsibility involved in gun ownership, which from its nature, necessitates a stricter regulatory scheme.<br><br>Nevertheless, inspection under R.A. No. 10591 and its IRR must be struck down for failure to limit the frequency of inspection. While Section 9.3 of the 2018 Revised IRR provides for more guidelines, my view is that the inspection must be subjected to further and more stringent standards, such as limiting the inspection only to one instance - prior to the issuance of the license. This is to ensure that the applicant has complied with the safety measures and vault requirements under the law.<br><br><b><i>Exception to Prohibition on <br>Bringing Firearms inside<br> Commercial Establishments</i></b><br><br>For the purpose of maintaining public peace and order, Section 7.11.2(b)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the IRR of R.A. No. 10591 commands that firearms be secured inside a vehicle or motorcycle compartment, and Section 7.12(b)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the IRR of R.A. No. 10591 prohibits the bringing offirearms inside places ofworship, public drinking, amusement places, and all other commercial or public establishments.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> holds the view that keeping a firearm secured in a motor vehicle compartment or motorcycle prevents the firearm owner from impulsively using the firearm in case of altercation. Meanwhile, the restriction on bringing a firearm to commercial or public places is a reasonable measure to prevent mass shootings.<br><br>I agree.<br><br>However, it is my op1mon that an exemption must be made for commercial establishment owners who own licensed firearms. The blanket prohibition on carrying firearms inside all commercial or public establishments poses an issue insofar as it renders nugatory the PTCFOR secured by the owners of these commercial establishments.<br><br>While I agree that maintaining public peace and order is important, enjoining even the commercial establishment owners themselves from bringing their firearms inside their place of business serves no viable purpose. Some commercial establishment owners such as small-scale business owners or sole proprietors cannot afford to engage the services of private security. With the prohibition, they are left with little to no means of protecting themselves or their clients against unlawful elements who may enter their establishments and commit violence. Verily, it is a declared State policy under Section 2 of R.A. No. 10951 that "the State recognizes the right of its qualified citizens to self-defense through, when it is the reasonable means to repel the unlawful aggression under the circumstances, the use of firearms." Prohibiting even these owners from bringing their firearm to their place of business does not support this declared State policy and contradicts the purpose for which establishment owners' PTCFOR was secured.<br><br>This prohibition also runs counter to Section 7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of R.A. No. 10591, which recognizes businessmen, who by the nature of their business or undertaking, are exposed to high risk of being target of criminal elements. Thus, in my view, this all-out prohibition in Section 7.12(b) of the IRR is unduly restrictive on their part.<br><br><b><i>Certification as Implicit Compulsion<br> to Join Gun Clubs</i></b><br><br>Anent the requirement for sports shooters to get a certification from the president of a recognized gun club under Section 4.10<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the IRR, the <i>ponencia</i> espouses that there is nothing in Section 4.10 that compels a sports shooter applicant to join a gun club or shooting association.<br><br>According to the <i>ponencia</i>, all that Section 4.10 provides is that a person intending to apply as a sports shooter must submit a certification from the President of a recognized gun club or sports shooting association that he or she is joining the competition.<br><br>Again, I depart from the <i>ponencia's</i> ruling in this regard.<br><br>To my mind, the requirement of a submitting a certification from the President of a recognized gun club tacitly compels a sports shooter applicant to join the gun club to which such President belongs, for it is reasonable to believe that no President of a gun club would issue a certification to non-members. Thus, this requirement under Section 4.10(b) is violative of the sports shooters' right to freedom of association.<br><br>Section 8, Article III of the 1987 Constitution guarantees the right of people to join or form associations:<br><blockquote>Section 8.
