				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">When issuing a pre-screened or pre-approved credit card, the credit card provider must prove that its client read and consented to the terms and conditions governing the credit card's use.

Nonetheless, it equitably reduced the monthly three percent (3%) interest and three percent (3%) penalty charged under the Terms and Conditions to one percent (1%) interest and one percent (1%) penalty, to be computed from demand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Metropolitan Trial Court's June 29, 2012 Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants <b>SPS.

It held that the Bank of the Philippine Islands successfully discharged its burden, as the signed Delivery Receipt and Rainier's use of credit card were proofs that Rainier agreed to be bound by its Terms and Conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court further ruled that the charge slips signed by the Yulo Spouses were the best evidence that they had indeed availed of the Bank of the Philippine Islands' credit accommodation. However, the facts established by the bank and the Yulo Spouses' failure to timely challenge the charges in the Statements of Account were sufficient evidence that the Yulo Spouses admitted the veracity of the Statements of Account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court's June 26, 2013 Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the appeals interposed by spouses Yulo is <b>DISMISSED</b> and the assailed decision dated June 29, 2011 (2012) of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Makati City Branch 65 is <b>AFFIRMED in toto</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The Yulo Spouses then filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On February 20, 2015, the Court of Appeals denied the Petition and affirmed the Regional Trial Court Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals concurred with the Regional Trial Court's finding that Rainier, through his authorized representative, received the pre-approved credit card issued by the Bank of the Philippine Islands, and thus, agreed to be bound by its Terms and Conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court of Appeals found that the Yulo Spouses' failure to contest the charges in the monthly Statements of Account signified that they accepted the veracity of the charges. It further noted that Rainier, an insurance underwriter, was familiar with contractual stipulations; hence, he could not feign ignorance over his own contractual obligation to the Bank of the Philippine Islands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals' February 20, 2015 Decision read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <i>Petition</i> is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.

They claim that the only valid proofs that they availed of respondent's credit line were the transaction slips they signed after purchasing goods or services with their credit cards, not the Statements of Account respondent presented as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> They also assert that the Terms and Conditions, which petitioner Rainier supposedly agreed to, was never presented as evidence. Moreover, respondent failed to substantiate its claim that he consented to the Terms and Conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Petitioners claim that respondent failed to prove that it ascertained the authority of Baitan, petitioner Rainier's purported authorized representative, before handing her the credit card packet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> They then assailed the Terms and Conditions for being "written in so fine prints and in breathlessly long sentences for the purpose of being ignored altogether, to the prejudice of the public."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They also claim that the imposed charges and penalties are "excessive and contrary to morals."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioners concede that the Court of Appeals did not err in striking down and replacing respondent's original charges and penalties for being usurious. However, they insist that the reckoning period of the lowered interest rates and penalties should be from March 9, 2008, when they were first in default, not from February 12, 2009, when a written demand was sent to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> respondent underscores that the Petition raised purely questions of fact improper in a petition for review on certiorari. Further, respondent claims that petitioners brought up the same issues already ruled upon by the lower courts, making it a pro-forma petition, which should be outright denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Respondent maintains that aside from petitioners' bare allegations that the charges against them were inaccurate, they have neither presented an alternative computation nor contested the supposed error in the billing statements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Respondent also asserts that when petitioners used their credit cards, they bound themselves to its Terms and Conditions in the credit card packet's Delivery Receipt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioners were directed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to reply to respondent's Comment, but they manifested<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> that they would no longer be filing their reply.<br><br>The sole issue for this Court's resolution is whether or not petitioners Rainier Jose M. Yulo and Juliet L. Yulo are bound by the Terms and Conditions on their use of credit cards issued by respondent.<br><br>When a credit card provider issues a credit card to a pre-approved or pre-screened client, the usual screening processes "such as the filing of an application form and submission of other relevant documents prior to the issuance of a credit card, are dispensed with and the credit card is issued outright."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> As the recipient of an unsolicited credit card, the pre-screened client can then choose to either accept or reject it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court found that the credit card packet from respondent, which contained petitioner's pre-approved credit card and a copy of its Terms and Conditions, was duly delivered to petitioner Rainier through his authorized representative, Baitan, as shown in the Delivery Receipt:<br><blockquote>As record shows, [the Bank of the Philippine Islands] presented as evidence the Delivery Receipt marked in evidence as Exhibit "C". The [Bank of the Philippine Islands] credit card issued in favor [of] defendant­-appellant Rainier Jose M. Yulo was received by his duly authorized representative, one Jessica Baitan. In fact, defendants-appellants admitted having made [use] and availed of the credits which plaintiff-appellees may have in its member establishments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>This was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which stated, "The [Bank of the Philippine Islands] credit card issued to petitioner Rainier was received by his authorized representative, a certain Jessica Baitan, as evidenced by a Delivery Receipt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As a pre-screened client, petitioner Rainier did not submit or sign any application form as a condition for the issuance of a credit card in his account. Unlike a credit card issued through an application form, with the applicant explicitly consenting to the Terms and Conditions on credit accommodation use, a pre-screened credit card holder's consent is not immediately apparent.<br><br>Thus, respondent, as the credit card provider, had the burden of proving its allegation that petitioner Rainier consented to the Terms and Conditions surrounding the use of the credit card issued to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>While the Delivery Receipt<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> showed that Baitan received the credit card packet for petitioner Rainier, it failed to indicate Baitan's relationship with him. Respondent also failed to substantiate its claim that petitioner Rainier authorized Baitan to act on his behalf and receive his pre-approved credit card. The only evidence presented was the check mark in the box beside "Authorized Representative" in the Delivery Receipt. This self-serving evidence is obviously insufficient to sustain respondent's claim.<br><br>A contract of agency is created when a person acts for or on behalf of a principal, with the latter's consent or authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Unless required by law, an agency does not require a particular form, and may be express or implied from the acts or silence of the principal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <i>Rallos v. Felix Go Chan &amp; Sons Realty Corporation</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> lays down the elements of agency:<br><blockquote>Out of the above given principles, sprung the creation an acceptance of the <i>relationship of agency</i> whereby one party, called the principal (<i>mandante</i>), authorizes another, called the agent (<i>mandatario</i>), to act for find (sic) in his behalf in transactions with third persons. The essential elements of agency are: (1) there is consent, express or implied, of the patties to establish the relationship; (2) the object is the execution of a juridical act in relation to a third person; (3) the agents (<i>sic</i>) acts as a representative and not for himself; and (4) the agent acts within the scope of his authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Respondent fell short in establishing an agency relationship between petitioner Rainier and Baitan, as the evidence presented did not support its claim that petitioner Rainier authorized Baitan to act on his behalf. Without proof that petitioner Rainier read and agreed to the Terms and Conditions of his pre-approved credit card, petitioners cannot be bound by it.<br><br>Petitioners do not deny receiving and using the credit cards issued to them. They do, however, insist that respondent failed to establish their liability because the Statements of Account submitted into evidence "merely reflect [their] alleged incurred transactions[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> but are not the source of their obligation or liability.<br><br>Petitioners are mistaken.<br><br>When petitioners accepted respondent's credit card by using it to purchase goods and services, a contractual relationship was created between them, "governed by the Terms and Conditions found in the card membership agreement. Such terms and conditions constitute the law between the parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Under Payment of Charges in the Terms and Conditions, petitioners would be furnished monthly Statements of Account and would have a 20-day period from the statement date to settle their outstanding balance, or the minimum required payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> However, with respondent's failure to prove petitioner Rainier's conformity and acceptance of the Terms and Conditions, petitioners cannot be bound by its provisions.<br><br>Nonetheless, petitioner Rainier admitted to receiving the Statements of Account from respondent, and was aware of the interest rate charges imposed by respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In his testimony, he even categorically admitted that he was not disputing the transactions and purchases he made before his default in payment and his account's freezing:<br><blockquote>ATTY. BAUTISTA:<br><blockquote>But would you admit that before June 2008 you made purchases?<br></blockquote>A<br><blockquote>Yes, Ma'am.<br></blockquote>Q<br><blockquote>Would you admit that those purchases were reflected in the Statement of Account?<br></blockquote>COURT:<br><blockquote>Were there disputed purchases before June 2008? <br></blockquote>ATTY. PUZON:<br><blockquote>None, Your Honor.<br></blockquote>COURT:<br><blockquote><i>That is improper because they are not disputing the purchases or transactions as stated in the Statement of Account earlier identified by the witness.</i><br></blockquote>ATTY.

Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and <i>Ledda v. Bank of the Philippine Islands</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> where the credit card provider also failed to prove the pre-screened client's consent to the credit card's terms and conditions. <i>Alcaraz</i> ruled that when the credit card provider failed to prove its client's consent, even if the latter did not deny availing of the credit card by charging purchases on it, the credit card client may only be charged with legal interest:<br><blockquote>As correctly pointed out by the Court of Appeals, <i>the petitioner should not be condemned to pay the interests and charges provided in the Terms and Conditions on the mere claim of the private respondent without any proof of the former 's conformity and acceptance of the stipulations contained therein</i>. Even if we are to accept the private respondent's averment that the stipulation quoted earlier is printed at the back of each and every credit card issued by private respondent Equitable, such stipulation is not sufficient to bind the petitioner to the Terms and Conditions without a clear showing that the petitioner was aware of and consented to the provisions of this document. This, the private respondent failed to do.<br><br>It is, however, undeniable that petitioner Alcaraz accumulated unpaid obligations both in his peso and dollar accounts through the use of the credit card issued to him by private respondent Equitable. As such, petitioner Alcaraz is liable for the payment thereof. <i>Since the provisions of the Terms and Conditions are inapplicable to petitioner Alcaraz, the legal interest on obligations consisting of loan or forbearance of money shall apply.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The records reveal that as of the July 9, 2008 Statement of Account, petitioners had an outstanding balance of P229,378.68. The Metropolitan Trial Court stated:<br><blockquote>As of Statement Date July 9, 2008, wherein defendants made their last payment, the outstanding balance is P110,778.49. However, there are still installments due on the account; thus, the following must be included in his obligation:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Establishment</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Monthly Installment</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>No. of Installments Due</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Amount Due</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>Automatic Centre</td><td><div align="center">624.96</div></td><td><div align="center">7</div></td><td><div align="center">4,374.72</div></td></tr><tr><td>Abenson</td><td><div align="center">961.11</div></td><td><div align="center">5</div></td><td><div align="center">4,805.55</div></td></tr><tr><td>Abenson</td><td><div align="center">849.58</div></td><td><div align="center">2</div></td><td><div align="center">1,699.16</div></td></tr><tr><td>EBC</td><td><div align="center">2,738.85</div></td><td><div align="center">3</div></td><td><div align="center">8,216.55</div></td></tr><tr><td>EBC</td><td><div align="center">7,012.48</div></td><td><div align="center">3</div></td><td><div align="center">21,037.44</div></td></tr><tr><td>EBC</td><td><div align="center">8,718.53</div></td><td><div align="center">9</div></td><td><div align="center">78,466.77</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>TOTAL</td><td> <div align="center">118,600.19</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Thus, the amount of P118,600.19 must be added to P110,778.49, which would sum up to P229,378.68.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The Metropolitan Trial Court ruling was affirmed by both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals.
