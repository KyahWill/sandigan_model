Consequently, petitioner, in the same unnumbered resolution and in the Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated April 19, 2006, designated Dr. Enrique R.

It ruled that the petition was not the proper remedy to assail the Memorandum dated April 19, 2006 and that respondent had other recourse before the CHED.<br><br>On Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the RTC Branch 41 issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated June 6, 2006 granting the motion. The RTC set aside the earlier Order dated May 2, 2006.<br><br>On June 13, 2006, the RTC Branch 41 issued another Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> granting a Temporary Restraining Order restraining petitioner and the other members of the BoT from implementing the Memorandum dated April 19, 2006, and ordering Dr. Hilario to cease and desist from exercising the functions as OIC of the Office of the President of EARIST. Further, the RTC Branch 41 ordered the reinstatement of respondent to resume her duties and functions as the President of EARIST.<br><br>On June 29, 2006, petitioner and other members of the BoT, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed a Very Respectful Motion for Inhibition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the Presiding Judge of Branch 41.<br><br>On June 30, 2006, Judge Vedasto B. Marco, Presiding Judge of RTC Branch 41, granted the motion for inhibition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The case was re-足raffled to RTC Branch 51.<br><br><div align="center"><i>Ruling of the RTC</i><br></div><br>On October 14, 2008, the RTC Branch 51 rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in the petition for injunction. The court <i>a quo</i> ruled that the designation of Dr. Hilario as OIC of the Office of the President of EARIST was not proper because the position of president was not vacated per Section 30<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulation (RIRR) for RA 8292.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Following the RIRR, respondent was still serving as President of EARIST.<br><br>The court <i>a quo</i>, in the application for an injunction by respondent against herein petitioner and all other members of the BoT, was posed with the question as to whether the issuance of an injunction to stop the implementation of the Memorandum dated April 19, 2006 was proper and tenable, considering that based from respondent's allegations, she was reaching the age of 67 by November 2007. Thus, the court <i>a quo</i> held that although the prayer for injunction was tenable, but since respondent's reappointment was only effective up to December 2007, it considered the issuance of an injunction order not proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>However, the court <i>a quo</i> awarded the respondent with actual damages by way of her unearned salary from April 19, 2006 up to December 2007; exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00; and attorney's fees in the amount of P20,000.00. Further, the court <i>a quo</i> required only the petitioner to pay the awards ratiocinating that the petitioner, in appointing an OIC in the Office of the President, displayed an abuse of power as Commissioner of the CHED and her action was purely personal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><i>Ruling of the CA</i><br></center><br>On February 28, 2012, the CA rendered the assailed Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which denied the appeal and affirmed the Decision dated October 14, 2008. The CA found it proper to award respondent with actual damages in the form of the loss of her salary from April 19, 2006 up to December 17, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Further, the CA upheld the court <i>a quo</i>'s findings that petitioner was liable for exemplary damages by way of example or correction for the public good because the existence of bad faith on the part of petitioner was established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Also, as to the award of attorney's fees, the CA found that petitioner had refused to satisfy respondent's valid, just, and demandable claim. Hence, the CA deemed it just and equitable to grant respondent the amount of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees.<br><br><center><i>The Issue</i><br></center><br>Petitioner maintains that the award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees in favor of respondent lacks basis as the BoT acted in good faith when it issued the unnumbered resolution and considered respondent as having retired from the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><i>Our Ruling</i><br></center><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>A petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 is an appeal from a ruling of a lower tribunal on pure questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In other words, in petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i>, only questions of law may be put into issue and questions of fact cannot be entertained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It is only in exceptional circumstances that the Court admits and reviews questions of fact, to wit: (1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the CA went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the CA manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> However, this case does not fall in any of the exceptional circumstances enumerated above.<br><br>In the petition before the Court, petitioner is raising mixed questions of fact and law.<br><br>Petitioner proffers that the award of the court <i>a quo</i> of damages in favor of respondent ostensibly lacks basis because there is no showing that the actuation or decision of the BoT was tainted with bad faith;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and that the BoT merely interpreted the provision of RA 8292 insofar as its power to extend the term of office of an incumbent president is concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moreover, petitioner explains that the BoT acted in good faith when it issued the unnumbered Resolution. Petitioner also asserts that the issuance of the unnumbered Resolution is a collegial action of the BoT since no one can act alone without the approval of the majority of the member. Hence, petitioner insists that the court <i>a quo</i> and the CA erred in singling her out as the only member of the BoT who shall be personally liable to respondent for exemplary damages and atton1ey's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>All told, the Court finds that the resolution of the propriety of the award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees entails a review of the factual circumstances which led the court <i>a quo</i>, as affirmed by the CA, to decide in such manner. Likewise, the position of petitioner that she did not act with malice or bad faith in the issuance of the unnumbered Resolution calls for the Court to analyze and weigh the evidence all over again.<br><br>It must be stressed that only questions of law can be addressed in reviews on <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It is not the function of the Court to analyze or weigh the evidence, which tasks belong to the trial court as the trier of facts and to the appellate court as the reviewer of facts. The Court is confined to the review of errors of law that may have been committed in the judgment under review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In <i>Madrigal v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court had the occasion to rule that the Court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been committed by the lower court. <i>The Court is not a trier of facts as it leaves these matters to the lower court, which has more opportunity and facilities to examine these matters. It is the policy of the Court to defer to the factual findings of the trial judge, who has the advantage of directly observing the witnesses on the stand and to determine their demeanor whether they are telling or distorting the truth.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>At any rate, as aptly ruled by the CA, there was nothing irregular with respondent's reappointment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> as the procedure for her reappointment was properly observed by the BoT;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> that it was done after a concerted evaluation of the BoT;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and which was very well in conformity with RA 8292.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> To stress, the BoT approved the reappointment of respondent as President of EARIST until December 17, 2007 during their regular meeting held on August 13, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, as found by both the court <i>a quo</i> and the CA, petitioner erred into believing that since respondent had already reached the age of 65 while serving as the President of EARIST, she was automatically and compulsorily terminated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the Court affirms the findings of the court <i>a quo</i> as to petitioner's display of an abuse of power as Commissioner of the CHED when she excluded respondent from the conference room that led to the appointment of Dr. Hilario as OIC in the Office of the President that consequently denied respondent of her right to due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Court finds that both the court <i>a quo</i> and the CA correctly awarded in favor of respondent actual damages by way of unearned salary from April 19, 2006 until December 17, 2007. It follows, therefore, that the award of exemplary damages is likewise proper. The requisites for the award of exemplary damages are as follows: <br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">they may be imposed by way of example in addition to compensatory damages, and only after the claimant's right to them has been established;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">that they cannot be recovered as a matter of right, their determination depending upon the amount of compensatory damages that may be awarded to the claimant; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">the act must be accompanied by bad faith or done in a wanton, fraudulent, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>There is no doubt that all of the requisites for the award of exemplary damages are present in the instant case. The imposition of exemplary damages on petitioner's part is by way of example or correction for the public good since the existence of bad faith was established by the court a quo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>On the grant of attorney's fees to respondent, the Court affirms both the court <i>a quo</i> and the CA that there was an unjustified refusal on the part of petitioner to satisfy respondent's valid, just, and demandable claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Hence, it is just and equitable to grant respondent attorney's fees.<br><br>However, applying the guidelines in <i>Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court finds that a legal interest at the rate of 6% shall be imposed on the amount finally adjudged, from the finality of this Decision until its full satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
