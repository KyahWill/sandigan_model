As such, they were respectively designated as Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and members of the BCS-Bids and Awards Committee (BCS-BAC) to facilitate BCS's procurement needs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Meanwhile, Varona was the Director IV of the BCS.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On November 7, 2005, Alcantara allegedly submitted a Purchase Request<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to Varona for the procurement of a Heidelberg single color offset printing machine (printing machine).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On even date, Josue and Villarosa issued BCS Disposition Form No. FAD-2005-39<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> informing Varona that the BCS had no approved capital outlay to support the purchase, and suggested a lease-to-own arrangement to obtain the equipment, chargeable against its Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) for fiscal year 2005. However, they also cautioned that this kind of transaction may be deemed irregular by the Commission on Audit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Despite knowing that its procurement was not supported by a corresponding appropriation, Varona approved the request.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> To finance the acquisition, he explained that they had flexibility in their budget pursuant to Section 1, paragraph (f) of Administrative Order No. (AO) 103,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> allowing them to use savings to fund the bureau's capital expenditures.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In turn, Josue, Villarosa, Enriquez, and Aala issued BCS-BAC Resolution No. 2005-01,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> recommending the adoption of "limited source bidding" in accordance with Section 49 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9184.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Josue then issued Direct Invitations to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid (Limited Source Bidding)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to three (3) companies, <i>i.e.</i>, Heidelberg Philippines, Union Services,&nbsp;&nbsp; and Ernest Printing Corporation (Ernest Printing), which correspondingly submitted their respective bids.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Ernest Printing emerged as the winning bidder<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> leading to the execution of a Contract of Lease­ Purchase with Guaranty Deposit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated November 10, 2005 between it and the BCS, as represented by Varona.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Aside from their roles in authorizing the procurement, petitioners also allegedly failed to comply with the proper rules and procedures laid down under RA 9184 and its IRR, as the procurement was apparently riddled with various irregularities. <i>First</i>, the direct invitations to bid were prematurely issued on November 7, 2005, a day before Varona's required approval for resort to limited source bidding was obtained on November 8, 2005. <i>Second</i>, the bidding was not published. <i>Third</i>, while Ernest Printing gave the lowest bid, it merely offered a 20-year-old, second-hand unit in the amount of P850,000.00, whereas Heidelberg Philippines and Union Services both offered brand new units in the amounts of P7,955,275.95 and P900,000.00, respectively. Notably, Union Services's offer for a brand new machine was just higher by P50,000.00 than Ernest Printing's offer for a 20-year-old, second-hand unit. Fourth, petitioners dispensed with the post-qualification requirements mandated under Section 34.1 to 34.3, Rule X of the IRR of RA 9184. <i>Lastly</i>, the contract was denominated as one for "lease-purchase," yet its provisions show that it was actually a contract of sale, as the full purchase price was immediately paid to Ernest Printing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For their part, petitioners collectively insisted that they discharged their official duties in good faith and in accordance with their individual functions as required by law and existing rules. Explaining that their respective roles in the procurement process were merely recommendatory, they cast blame on Varona as the person responsible for the irregularities in the procurement of the printing machine, being the bureau's head and the final authority to accept or reject their recommendation if he deems it improper or unlawful. They also manifested that their utilization of the bureau's MOOE account to finance the transaction was justified in view of AO 103.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Additionally, Josue and Villarosa further argued that they had no malicious intent in recommending such transaction, as they honestly raised the fact of its irregularities through the issuance of BCS Disposition Form No. FAD-2005-39.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> To them, this constitutes sufficient notice in writing to absolve them from liability under Section 106<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1445.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the case, the SB dismissed the criminal case as against Varona on account of his supervening death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><div align="center"><br></div><div align="center">The SB Ruling<br></div></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated May 25, 2018, the SB found petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, and accordingly, sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six (6) years and one (1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum, with perpetual disqualification to hold public office and forfeiture of all retirement or gratuity benefits under any law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The SB held that the prosecution had sufficiently established the presence of all the elements of the crime charged. It found that petitioners, through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or through gross inexcusable negligence, gave unwarranted advantage, benefit, or preference to Ernest Printing in the lease-purchase of the printing machine in the amount of P882,075.47, despite the absence of capital outlay and competitive bidding, doing so by improperly utilizing the account for MOOE to finance the acquisition, resulting in damage and prejudice to the government and the public interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Moreover, the SB ruled that conspiracy existed among the petitioners as a community of criminal design may be inferred from their actions as members of the BCS and BCS-BAC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated July 30, 2018. Hence, these consolidated petitions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the SB correctly convicted petitioners of the crime of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 states:<br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Corrupt practices of public officers</i>. - In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the grant of licenses or permits or other concessions.</blockquote>Verily, the elements of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 are as follows: (<i>a</i>) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions (or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers); (<i>b</i>) that he acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (<i>c</i>) that his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In this case, the SB correctly found that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt the existence of the foregoing elements, as it was shown that: <b><u><i>first</i></u></b>, petitioners are all public officers occupying key positions in the BCS, namely Finance and Administrative Division OIC, Accounting Section OIC, Publications and Productions Chief, Special Productions Division Chief, and Administrative Officer V, and they were designated as Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and members of the BCS­ BAC; <b><u><i>second</i></u></b>, they, in conspiracy<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> with one another, acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in the procurement of the printing machine because they knowingly proceeded with the transaction despite the absence of capital outlay and competitive bidding, doing so by improperly utilizing the bureau's MOOE account, in clear violation of the basic and well-known principle that no money shall be paid out of any public treasury, except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and <b><u><i>third</i></u>,</b> petitioners gave Ernest Printing unwarranted advantage and preference by failing to conduct a public bidding, thereby precluding other suppliers from submitting bids which might be more beneficial fur the government, accepting an offer of a 20-year-old, second­ hand printing machine over an offer of a brand new one for a measly difference of P50,000.00, recommending the execution of a lease-purchase contract which requires the government to immediately pay in full an equipment it was supposed to be renting, and dispensing with the post­ qualification requirements under the law, thus resulting in undue injury to the government.<br><br>In an attempt to absolve themselves from criminal liability, petitioners insist that: (<i>a</i>) their resort to limited source bidding cannot result in prejudice to the government as it was a permitted practice under Section 49<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of RA 9184, and even assuming <i>arguendo </i>that the resort to such mode of procurement was improper, the absence of a public bidding <i>per se</i> does not make them criminally liable absent a clear showing that they indeed acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; (<i>b</i>) their use of the bureau's MOOE account was in accordance with AO 103, which allows them to use savings to fund capital programs, reliance on which is an indication of good faith; (<i>c</i>) by accepting Ernest Printing's second-hand printing machine in the amount of P850,000.00 over Union Service's offer in the amount of P900,000.00, they did not give the former undue preference because the former was still indisputably lower than the latter, and that there was no competent proof to establish that the unit offered by Union Service was indeed brand new; (<i>d</i>) their acquittal in this criminal case is justified, considering that in the counterpart administrative case for Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct, the Office of the Ombudsman downgraded their administrative liability to only Simple Neglect of Duty, finding that their failure to observe proper procurement rules and procedure was not tainted with malice and/or bad faith;<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[41]</sup></font> (<i>e</i>) their right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them was violated when the SB discussed the concept of "capital outlay," a term which does not appear in the Information; and (<i>f</i>) the SB erred in appreciating the existence of conspiracy, absent proof of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' arguments are untenable.<br><br>As the SB accurately ratiocinated, the crime charged in the Information is not one for violation of budgetary, auditing or accounting rules, <i>per se</i>, but rather, one for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, the elements of which have already been established in this case, as afore­discussed. Further, the SB also correctly pointed out that petitioners' reliance on AO 103 is misplaced as it must be read in conjunction with existing laws pertaining to government spending and auditing. As an executive issuance, Section 1 (f) of AO 103 merely authorizes the realignment of savings to fund capital programs of the government. It does not authorize the use of government funds for capital acquisitions without corresponding appropriations, in violation of the fundamental constitutional precept that "[n]o money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Here, as the SB observed, petitioners knew very well from the start that the acquisition of the printing machine had no approved capital outlay; nonetheless, they still persisted in proceeding with the illegal transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the SB correctly opined that the ruling in the counterpart administrative case holds no water in the instant criminal case, as it is hornbook doctrine in administrative law that administrative cases are independent from criminal actions for the same acts or omissions. Given the differences in the quantum of evidence required, the procedures actually observed, the sanctions imposed, as well as the objective of the two (2) proceedings, the findings and conclusions in one should not necessarily be binding on the other. Hence, the exoneration in the administrative case is not a bar to a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts which were the subject of the administrative complaint or vice versa.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Finally, the SB did not err in declaring that there was no violation of petitioners' constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against them by the use of the term "capital outlay" in its Decision without mentioning the same in the Information, as such right merely requires that an Information only state the ultimate facts constituting the offense and not the finer details of why and how the crime was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Similarly, the Court observes that the SB likewise did not err in concluding that Section 106 of PD 1445 cannot be applied in favor of Josue and Villarosa as the notice required under the law should be given "prior to that act." Here, petitioners had belatedly sent the notice of irregularity in the transaction, <i>i.e</i>., ·after the bidding process had already begun.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court finds no cogent reason to overturn petitioners' conviction, as there was no showing that the SB overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of these consolidated cases, especially considering that the SB was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the consolidated petitions are <b>DENIED</b>.
