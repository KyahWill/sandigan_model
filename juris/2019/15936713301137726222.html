The assailed Resolution, on the other hand, denied for lack of merit petitioners' subsequent Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><center><i>The Antecedents</i><br></center><br>The factual and procedural antecedents of this case, as summarized by the CA, are as follows:<br><blockquote>On September 24, 2003, [respondent] Elizabeth D. Daclan, through a document denominated as Application for Continual Use, purchased from [petitioner] Park Developers Incorporated ("PDI" for brevity) a family estate memorial lot located at Sanctuary Memorial Park ("Sanctuary" for brevity), Barangay Timalan, Naic, Cavite. The total contract price is P708,000.00, payable in thirty-six monthly installments. At the time of the institution of the instant case, [respondent] had already paid PDI a total amount of P457,760.74.<br><br>However, sometime in 2005, [respondent] learned that, as certified by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), it had never issued any Certificate of Registration or License to Sell in favor of PDI. Thus, on January 13, 2006, [respondent] filed the instant case [for Annulment of Contract with Damages] against PDI and its corporate officers, Reynaldo Jesus B. Pasco, Sr., Rolando G. Golla, Nenita B. Pasco, Julito P. Caparas, Teresa B. Caparas, and Constancio R. Bernardo.<br></blockquote>On March 31, 2011, the RTC rendered judgment against [petitioners], disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court resolved as follows, to wit:<br><br>a. Annulling the agreement denominated as 'application for continual use' entered into between [respondent] and [petitioners] and ordering the latter, jointly and solidarily, to return to the [respondent] all payments made by her in the total amount of Four Hundred Fifty Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Sixty and 74/100 (Php457,760.74), plus legal interest computed from the time [petitioners] failed to return said amount despite valid demand;<br><br>b. Ordering [petitioners], jointly and solidarily, to pay [respondent] moral damage in the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php50,000.00);<br><br>c. Ordering [petitioners], jointly and solidarily, to pay [respondent] Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php50,000.00) exemplary damages;<br><br>d. Ordering [petitioners], jointly and solidarily, to pay attorney's fees in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00).<br><br>On the other hand, compulsory counterclaim of [respondent] is DENIED for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Unsatisfied with the RTC's ruling, petitioners interposed an appeal in accordance with Section 2(a), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court which was given due course in the RTC Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated July 11, 2011.<br><br>In their Appellant[s'] Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> petitioners imputed a lone error:<br><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT PATENTLY ERRED IN RENDERING THE APPEALED DECISION DESPITE LACK OF JURISDICTION.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>According to petitioners, it is the HLURB and not the RTC which has primary jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case filed by respondent.<br><br><center><i>The CA's Ruling</i><br></center><br>On August 12, 2013, the CA rendered the now assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dismissing petitioners' appeal. It led that since petitioners' appeal raised no question other than the issue of jurisdiction, they should have taken their appeal directly to this Court by filing a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court and not an ordinary appeal with the CA under Rule 41 of the same Rules.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of all the foregoing, the appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> pursuant to Rule 50, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In the assailed February 10, 2014, Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the CA denied their motion.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br><center><i>The Issue</i><br></center><br>Petitioners argue that the CA erred in dismissing their appeal for raising a pure question of law without first passing judgment on whether the HLURB has primary jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case. They assert that they were only constrained to raise the sole issue of jurisdiction considering that the judgment of the RTC is void. Petitioners thus beseech this Court to now "decide the novel issue of jurisdiction over action to annul contracts for the purchase or continual use of memorial lots."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><i>The Courts Ruling</i><br></center><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br> <table Â ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="justify"><i>I. The CA was correct in dismissing petitioners' appeal pursuant to Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court; however, for the sake of justice and equity, the relaxation of the rule of procedure is warranted in this case.</i></div></td><td width="60%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>At the outset, the CA's finding that petitioners solely anchored their appeal on a purely legal question deserves respect from this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14] </sup>In their appeal before the CA, petitioners raised the sole issue of whether the trial court was vested with jurisdiction to hear and try the case filed by respondent. In the present petition, they also readily admit that they "assigned as error only the validity of the appealed Decision of the lower court for lack of jurisdiction of the RTC over the present case for rescission of the 'Application for Continual Use', x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Under the Rules of Court, there are two modes of appeal from a decision or final order of the trial court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction: (1) by writ of error under Section 2(a), Rule 41 if questions of fact or questions of fact and law are raised or involved; or (2) appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Section 2(c), Rule 41, in relation to Rule 45, where only questions of law are raised or involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This is glaringly clear from the provisions of Section 2, Rule 41, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. Modes of appeal. -<br><br>(a) <i>Ordinary appeal</i>. - The appeal to the Court of Appeals in cases decided by the Regional Trial Court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from and serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record on appeal shall be required except in special proceedings and other cases of multiple or separate appeals where the law or these Rules so require. In such cases, the record on appeal shall be filed and served in like manner.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>(c) <i>Appeal by certiorari</i>. - In all cases where only questions of law are raised or involved, the appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> in accordance with Rule 45.<br></blockquote>Thus, this Court finds that the CA did not err in dismissing petitioners' appeal. Since what petitioners raised in their appeal was a pure question of law, their proper recourse was to file before this Court a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17] </sup>In fact, the CA's dismissal of petitioners' appeal was the only proper and unavoidable outcome as Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. <i>Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals</i>. - An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court. Similarly, an appeal by notice of appeal instead of by petition for review from the appellate judgment of a Regional Trial Court shall be dismissed.<br><br><b>An appeal erroneously taken to the Court of Appeals shall not be transferred to the appropriate court but shall be dismissed outright.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Notwithstanding the absence of error on the part of the CA in dismissing petitioners' appeal, this Court finds it imperative to resolve the substantive issue of the instant case in order to render a just and speedy disposition thereof. As held in <i>Ong Lim Sing, Jr. v. FEB Leasing and Finance Corp.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> courts have the prerogative to relax procedural rules of even the most mandatory character, bearing in mind the duty to reconcile both the need to speedily put an end to litigation and the parties' right to due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In numerous cases, the liberal construction of the rules has been allowed by this Court when to do so would serve the demands of substantial justice and equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In <i>Nursery Care Corp., et al. v. Acevedo, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court adopted a liberal approach and resolved the case on the merits despite its ruling that the CA's dismissal of the appeal therein was proper as it raised only questions of law. Similarly, this Court finds it proper to relax the technical rules or procedure in this case, taking into consideration the earlier pronouncement in <i>Spouses Go v. Chaves, et al.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote>Our rules of procedure are designed to facilitate the orderly disposition of cases and permit the prompt disposition of unmeritorious cases which clog the court dockets and do a little more than waste the courts' time. These technical and procedural rules, however, are intended to ensure, rather than suppress, substantial justice. A deviation from their rigid enforcement may thus be allowed, as petitioners should be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of their case, rather than lose their property on mere technicalities. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="justify"><i>II.

Further, Rule II thereof prescribes the procedure for the registration and licensing of memorial park/cemetery projects.<br><br>Given the foregoing, although respondent's complaint was within the jurisdiction of the RTC, the circumstances surrounding her purchase of a memorial lot brought it clearly within the ambit of the HLURB's primary jurisdiction.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">However, this Court disagrees with petitioners' insistence that the March 31, 2011 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of the RTC is void for lack of jurisdiction.

Neither did they challenge the very judgment of the RTC which, among others, annulled their agreement with respondent denominated as Application for Continual Use; ordered them to return to respondent all the payments she made in the total amount of P457,760.74, plus legal interest; and ordered them to pay moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees. To this Court, petitioners' omission to question the RTC's judgment connotes their admission that they are indeed liable to respondent.<br><br>At any rate, this Court finds the RTC Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated March 31, 2011 to be in order. The RTC correctly annulled the Application for Continual Use on the ground that respondent's consent to enter into such agreement was vitiated by mistake. Under Article 1331 of the Civil Code, "[i]n order that mistake may invalidate consent, it should refer to the substance of the thing which is the object of the contract, or to those conditions which have principally moved one or both parties to enter into the contract." Here, the RTC found that respondent was enticed by the written advertisement of PDI stating the convenient features one would enjoy at Sanctuary Memorial Park which did not materialize.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The RTC also noted the absence of knowledge on the part of respondent that PDI was not clothed with authority to sell or dispose of the memorial lots at Sanctuary Memorial Park at the time the agreement was executed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Undeniably, these conditions vitiated respondent's consent and sufficiently justified the annulment of the Application for Continual Use.<br><br>As to the damages awarded, this Court also finds no reason to deviate from the findings of the RTC. Moral damages may be awarded when there is willful injury to property if the court should find that, under the circumstances, such damages are justly due.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Further, exemplary damages may be awarded by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to the moral damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In this case, the RTC found that the attendant circumstances caused respondent to suffer sleepless nights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It also noted that petitioners' acts were accompanied with bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Hence, the award of moral and exemplary damages to respondent was proper.<br><br>Moreover, the RTC correctly ordered the award of attorney's fees in favor of respondent who was constrained to litigate, hire the services of counsel, and incur expenses to enforce her rights and protect her interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As provided in Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code, recovery of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, may be allowed in cases where the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to incur expenses to protect his interest.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
