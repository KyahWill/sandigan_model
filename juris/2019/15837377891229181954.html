CR No. 01948.</p><p> On June 13, 2016, Fernandez and Plata, through the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), filed a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure assailing the June 30, 2015 Decision and April 12, 2016 Resolution of the CA-Cebu. </p><p> On August 3, 2016, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> denying the Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> for the PAO's failure to: (1) sufficiently show any reversible error in the challenged decision and resolution as to warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction; (2) state the material date of filing of the motion for reconsideration in violation of Sections 4(b) and 5, Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure in relation to Section 5(d), Rule 56; and (3) submit a soft copy of the petition pursuant to Administrative Matter (A.M.) No. 11-9-4-SC (Efficient Use of Paper Rule) in relation to Section 5(e), Rule 56 of the Rules of Court. </p><p> On November 9, 2016, the PAO filed a Manifestation/Compliance with attached Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> submitting the soft copy of the petition and its annexes. Fernandez and Plata imputed error on the part of the court <em>a quo</em> in not giving credence to their testimony that no illegal drugs were confiscated from their possession when the police officers arrested them. They argued that the procedures in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were not properly observed especially with respect to the marking of the item seized from Fernandez. They challenged the identity of the <em>corpus delicti</em> in the light of the prosecution's failure to present all persons who marked and had custody of the confiscated illegal drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> In its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated March 27, 2017, the Court denied the Motion with finality, as no compelling reason exists and no substantial arguments were raised to warrant its reconsideration. Thus, the August 3, 2016 Resolution of the Court became final and executory and an Entry of Judgment was made. </p><p> On January 11, 2019, Fernandez and Plata filed the instant Manifestation asking the Court to grant them leniency and to allow the application of the plea bargaining framework in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC for the purpose of reducing their sentence. They hinged their request on the fact that at the time of the trial of their case, plea bargaining in drugs cases was still prohibited. </p><p> The Court resolves to DENY the plea for the reduction of the penalty imposed on Fernandez and Plata. </p><p> On April 10, 2018, the Court issued a Resolution in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC ordering the adoption of a plea bargaining framework in cases involving illegal drugs. The new framework is an offshoot of our ruling in <i>Estipona v. Lobrigo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> where we declared unconstitutional Section 23 of R.A. No. 9165 which bars plea bargain deals in drugs cases. Thus, under the framework, an accused charged with violation of Section 11 paragraph 3 of R.A. No. 9165 for illegal possession of dangerous drugs where the quantity is less than 5 grams may be allowed to enter a plea of guilty to a lesser offense of possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Section 12 of R. A. No. 9165. Consequently, the accused shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment for six months and one day to four years and pay the fine ranging from P10,000.00 to P50,000.00 instead of 12 years and one day to 20 years in prison and a fine ranging from P300,000.00 to P400,000.00. </p><p> A plain reading of the Manifestation filed by Fernandez and Plata will show that they seek the reduction of the penalty imposed upon them by the RTC pursuant to the plea bargaining framework <em>sans</em> a plea of guilty to a lesser offense. </p><p> "Plea bargaining in criminal cases is a process whereby the accused and the prosecution work out a mutually satisfactory disposition of the case subject to court approval. It usually involves the defendant's pleading guilty to a lesser offense or to only one or some of the counts of a multi-count indictment in return for a lighter sentence than that for the graver charge."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 2. <i>Plea of guilty to a lesser offense</i>. â€” The accused, with the consent of the offended party and the fiscal, may be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense, regardless of whether or not it is necessarily included in the crime charged, or is cognizable by a court of lesser jurisdiction than the trial court. No amendment of the complaint or information is necessary. </p> </blockquote> <p> The basic requisites of plea bargaining are: (1) consent of the offended party; (2) consent of the prosecutor; (3) plea of guilty to a lesser offense which is necessarily included in the offense charged; and (4) approval of the court. Among these conditions, the requirement of a plea offer is the most crucial, without which there is no plea bargain to speak of and, logically, there is no basis upon which to sustain a claim for the reduction of sentence under the plea bargaining framework. </p><p> Interestingly, Fernandez and Plata anchored their request for the reduction of the sentence imposed on them on the mere issuance of the plea bargaining framework which, they claim, offers a more favorable penalty than that prescribed under R.A. No. 9165. It bears stressing, however, that the reduction of penalty is but a consequence of the plea negotiation. In <i>People v. Magat</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court had the occasion to enunciate that "it is the essence of a plea of guilty that the accused admits absolutely and unconditionally his guilt and responsibility for the offense imputed to him." Hence, absent a categorical and unqualified admission of guilt for a lighter offense than that actually charged, the accused should be sentenced to suffer the penalty prescribed for the offense to which he actually pleaded. Accordingly, Fernandez and Plata should serve the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to fourteen (14) years imposed by the RTC. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Manifestation with prayer for the commutation of sentence filed by Noel Fernandez y Villegas and Andrew Plata y Sumatra is <strong>DENIED</strong>. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED. </b></p><p> <em>Carpio (Chairperson), Caguioa, Lazaro-Javier</em>, and <em>Zalameda, JJ</em>., concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 131-132. <p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 52-62. </p> <p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 61.</p> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Penned by Associate Edward B.
