In a Rule 45 review, the Court examines the correctness of the CA Decision in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits the review to questions of law. In ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA Decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was presented to the CA. Hence, the Court has to examine the CA Decision from the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Case law states that grave abuse of discretion connotes a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, done in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, the character of which being so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare, and accordingly, dismiss the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, as the tribunal correctly found that Kho should not be held solidarity liable with the Corporation, considering that his claims are in accord with the evidence on record, as well as settled legal principles of labor law.<br><br>It is settled that a corporation is a juridical entity with legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; As a juridical entity, a corporation may act only through its directors, officers, and employees. As such, obligations incurred by the corporation, acting through its directors, officers, and employees, are its sole liabilities,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and these persons should not be held jointly and solidarity liable with the corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; However, being a mere fiction of law, this corporate veil can be pierced when such corporate fiction is used: (<i>a</i>) to defeat public convenience or as a vehicle for the evasion of an existing obligation; (<i>b</i>) to justify wrong, protect or perpetuate fraud, defend crime, or as a shield to confuse legitimate issues;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> or (<i>c</i>) as a mere alter ego or business conduit of a person, or is so organized and controlled and its affairs are so conducted as to make it merely an instrumentality, agency, conduit, or adjunct of another corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Fundamental in the realm of labor law that corporate directors, trustees, or officers can be held solidarity liable with the corporation when they assent to a patently unlawful act of the corporation, or when they are guilty of bad faith or gross negligence in directing its affairs, or when there is a conflict of interest resulting in damages to the corporation, its stockholders, or other persons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> However, it bears emphasis that a finding of personal liability against a director, trustee, or a corporate officer requires the concurrence of these two (2) requisites, namely: (<i>a</i>) a clear allegation in the complaint of gross negligence, bad faith or malice, fraud, or any of the enumerated exceptional instances; and (<i>b</i>) clear and convincing proof of said grounds relied upon in the complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> sufficient to overcome the burden of proof borne by the complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this case, the evidence on record do not support the findings of both the LA and the CA that Kho was the Corporation's President at the time of its closure, and that he assented to a patently unlawful act, thereby exposing him to solidary liability with the Corporation. A plain reading of the Corporation's GIS for the years 2007<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and 2008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> show that Kho was not the Corporation's President as he was merely its Treasurer, while the GIS for the year 2009<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; indicates that he is no longer a corporate officer of the Corporation. More importantly, aside from respondents' bare allegations, there is a dearth of evidence on record that would indicate that Kho was a corporate officer at the time the restaurant, where respondents worked, closed down.<br><br>On this score, even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Kho was a corporate officer, nowhere in the complaint nor in the respondents' submissions before the labor tribunals did they allege that Kho committed bad faith, fraud, negligence, or any of the aforementioned exceptions to warrant his personal liability. The fact that it was Kho's daughter who posted the closure notice and with whom respondents requested for an audience with Kho to tackle the issue of closure – which notice was not even presented in evidence – is no proof that he orchestrated the closure or assented to the same, let alone in bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Relatedly, bad faith cannot be ascribed on any of the Corporation's officers by the mere fact that the Corporation failed to comply with the notice requirement before closing down the restaurant. Case law instructs that "[n]either does bad faith arise automatically just because a corporation fails to comply with the notice requirement of labor laws on company closure or dismissal of employees. The failure to give notice is not an unlawful act because the law does not define such failure as unlawful. Such failure to give notice is a violation of procedural due process but does not amount to an unlawful or criminal act. Such procedural defect is called illegal dismissal because it fails to comply with mandatory procedural requirements, but it is not illegal in the sense that it constitutes an unlawful or criminal act."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Verily, absent any finding that Kho was a corporate officer of the Corporation who willfully and knowingly assented to patently unlawful acts of the latter, or who is guilty of bad faith or gross negligence in directing its affairs, or is guilty of conflict of interest resulting in damages thereto, he cannot be held personally liable for the corporate liabilities arising from the instant case. In <i>Guillermo v. Uson</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>In the earlier labor cases of <i>Claparols v. Court of Industrial Relations</i> [460 Phil. 624 (1975] and <i>A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU v. NLRC</i> [226 Phil. 199 (1986)], persons who were not originally impleaded in the case were, even during execution, held to be solidarity liable with the employer corporation for the latter's unpaid obligations to complainant-employees. These included a newly-formed corporation which was considered a mere conduit or alter ego of the originally impleaded corporation, and/or the officers or stockholders of the latter corporation. Liability attached, especially to the responsible officers, even after final judgment and during execution, when there was a failure to collect from the employer corporation the judgment debt awarded to its workers. in <i>Naguiat v. NLRC</i> [336 Phil. 545 (1997)], the president of the corporation was found, for the first time on appeal, to be solidarity liable to the dismissed employees. Then, in <i>Reynoso v.</i> [<i>CA</i>] [339 Phil. 38 (2000)], the veil of corporate fiction was pierced at the stage of execution, against a corporation not previously impleaded, when it was established that such corporation had dominant control of the original party corporation, which was a smaller company, in such a manner that the latter's closure was done by the former in order to defraud its creditors, including a former worker.<br><br>The rulings of this Court in <i>A.C. Ransom, Naguiat</i>, and <i>Reynoso</i>, however, have since been tempered, at least in the aspects of the lifting of the corporate veil and the assignment of personal liability to directors, trustees[,] and officers in labor cases. The subsequent cases of <i>McLeod v. NLRC, Spouses Santos v. NLRC</i> and <i>Carag v. NLRC</i>, have all established, save for certain exceptions, the primacy of Section 31 of the Corporation Code in the matter of assigning such liability for a corporation's debts, including judgment obligations in labor cases. According to these cases, a <b><u>corporation is still an artificial being invested by law with a personality separate and distinct from that of its stockholders and from that of other corporations to which it may be connected. It is not in every instance of inability to collect from a corporation that the veil of corporate fiction is pierced, and the responsible officials are made liable. Personal liability attaches only when, as enumerated by the said Section 31 of the Corporation Code, there is a fwillfull and knowing assent to patently unlawful acts of the corporation, there is gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation, or there, is a conflict of interest resulting in damages to the corporation</u></b>. x x x.<br><br>It also bears emphasis that in cases where personal liability attaches, not even all officers are made accountable. Rather, only the "responsible officer," <i>i.e</i>., the person directly responsible for and who "acted in bad faith" in committing the illegal dismissal or any act violative of the Labor Code, is held solidarily liable, in cases wherein the corporate veil is pierced. In other instances, such as cases of so-called corporate tort of a close corporation, it is the person "actively engaged" in the management of the corporation who is held liable. In the absence of a clearly identifiable officer(s) directly responsible for the legal infraction, the Court considers the president of the corporation as such officer.<br><br>The common thread running among the aforementioned cases, however, is that the veil of corporate fiction can be pierced, and responsible corporate directors and officers or even a separate but related corporation, may be impleaded and held answerable solidarily in a labor case, even after final judgment and on execution, <b><u>so long as it is established that such persons have deliberately used the corporate vehicle to unjustly evade the judgment obligation, or have resorted to fraud, bad faith or malice in doing so</u><u>.</u></b> When the shield of a separate corporate identity is used to commit wrongdoing and opprobriously elude responsibility, the courts and the legal authorities in a labor case have not hesitated to step in and shatter the said shield and deny the usual protections to the offending party, even after final judgment. <b><u>The key element is the presence of fraud, malice or bad faith.</u></b> Bad faith, in this instance, does not connote bad judgment or negligence but imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of wrong; it means breach of a known duty through some motive or interest or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In sum, the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC and in ruling that Kho should be held solidarily liable with the corporate liabilities of the Corporation. Hence, the NLRC ruling must be reinstated.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
