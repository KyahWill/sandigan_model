CR HC No. 0746 which affirmed the Decision dated March 23, 2015 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 19, Bangui, Ilocos Norte, in Criminal Case No. 2154-19. The RTC found accused-appellant Nomer Wisco y Failano (Wisco) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal sale of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><center><i>Antecedents</i><br></center><br>On November 5, 2013, Wisco was charged with the crime of violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 for selling methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). The Information alleged:<br><blockquote>That on or about 10:00 o'clock in the evening of November 2, 2013 at Brgy. 4, Poblacion, municipality of Pasuquin, province of Ilocos Norte, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there wil[l]fully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly sell two (2) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing 0.0619 gram and 0.1080 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as "shabu", a dangerous drug, in the amount of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) to an agent of the PNP Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte acting as poseur-buyer, without any authority or license from the appropriate government agency to do so.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>On November 18, 2013, Wisco, assisted by counsel <i>de oficio</i>, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><center><i>Version of the Prosecution</i><br></center><br>The facts according to the prosecution are as follows:<br><blockquote>At 10:00 P.M. [o]f November 2, 2013, a confidential informant went to Pasuquin Municipal Police Station and reported the rampant selling of shabu by Nomer Wisco in Barangay 4, Poblacion, Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte. SPO1 Caldito verified this through text message and confirmed that Wisco was indeed involved in the sale of illegal drugs.<br><br>A briefing was then conducted by Police Chief Lauro Milan for a buy bust operation against Wisco. PO1 Rosal was designated as the poseur-buyer to be accompanied by the informant during the transaction. A one thousand peso bill was marked with "AR" to serve as the buy bust money. It was agreed that the pre-arranged signal was the removal of the cap by PO1 Rosal to signify the consummation of the transaction. SPO1 Caldito and PO3 Bulosan were designated as the back-up.<br><br>Upon proceeding to the target area, particularly along the barangay road I (sic) front of Guanzon Building, PO1 Rosal and the informant went ahead of the team. At the area, Wisco was already waiting and asked what PO1 Rosal and the informant needed. The informant replied that they will buy and PO1 Rosal handed the marked money. Wisco in turn brought out two (2) plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance and handed one sachet to PO1 Rosal. After examining it, PO1 Rosal then removed his bullcap, signifying the completion of the transaction. Wisco, then recognizing him to be a police officer, immediately ran away towards the direction where SPO1 Caldito was positioned. SPO1 Caldito was able to intercept him after a brief chase wherein they fell into a canal.<br><br>Immediately after his apprehension, Wisco was frisked and the police officers were able to recover one (1) cellphone, a lighter and another plastic sachet with white crystalline substance. PO1 Rosal then marked the plastic sachet containing suspected shabu bought from Wisco as "AR" and the second plastic sachet seized as "AR1" at the place of the arrest and in the presence of Barangay Chairman Armando Aguinaldo and two (2) Barangay Kagawads.<br><br>Once the inventory was concluded, PO3 Bulosan, together with PO1 Rosal, PO2 Jully Bacud and PO1 Kingsley Luna proceeded to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Camp Valentine Juan, Laoag City for submission of the seized item for laboratory analysis.<br><br>PO3 Mervin Reyes received the items from PO2 Bacud. He turned the items over to Forensic Chemist Police Inspector Arniely Ann Navarro for examination. It was determined that the two (2) plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug. After examining them, she placed the two (2) transparent plastic sachets in a transparent plastic sachet or ice bag and sealed it with masking tape with markings written on it. She then prepared the Final Chemistry Report No. D-138-2013-IN and turned over the specimens to the evidence custodian, PO3 John Edwin Padayao, for safekeeping.<br><br>Per Chemistry Report Number D-138-2013-IN, the two (2) transparent plastic sachets each containing white crystalline substance with markings (1) A1 (AR) = 0.0619 gram, and (2) A2 (AR1) = 0.1080 gram, gave positive result to the test for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote><div align="center"><i>Version of the Defense</i><br></div><br>Wisco interposed the defense of denial in this wise:<br><blockquote>For his part, accused Nomer Wisco interposed the defense of denial. He alleged that in the evening on 2 November 2013, he went outside his house to buy "empanada" for his daughter. He was riding his bicycle at the vicinity of Guanzon Store, Barangay 4, Poblacion, Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, when someone aboard a motorcycle went beside him and held the handle of his bicycle. He knew them to be Police officers (sic) Jonathan Caldito, Frederick Bulosan and Mario Corcoro. The bicycle fell and they immediately held him. He asked them, "Why, Sir?" He was wearing basketball short pants when they frisked him and he only had his cellphone and money to buy "empanada." He was then handcuffed and brought to the Police Station. When they could not get anything from him, he was brought (sic) back to the vicinity of Guanzon Store and he was placed in front of the patrol car. Police Officer Caldito place (sic) two (2) plastic sachets in front of the patrol car and talked to Brgy. Chairman Armando Aguinaldo and took photographs. Thereafter, he was brought back to the Police Station and locked up.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><i>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</i><br></div><br>In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated March 23, 2015, the RTC found Wisco guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A.

No. 9165 does not depend on the quantity of dangerous drugs sold, the Court rules that without prejudice to the Court's determination as to whether the chain of custody requirement was satisfied, Wisco, <i>at the most</i>, can only be convicted for selling 0.0619 gram of shabu as contained in the transparent plastic sachet marked as "AR." This finding is based on the testimonies of PO1 Alexon Rosal (PO1 Rosal) and SPO1 Jonathan Caldito (SPO1 Caldito).<br><br>In PO1 Rosal's testimony, he described the alleged shabu sold to him as contained in a small plastic sachet which he subsequently marked as "AR." On the other hand, the other sachet of alleged shabu which was subsequently marked as "AR1" was recovered by SPO1 Caldito from Wisco following the latter's arrest and upon frisking him.

Thus, as to the sachet marked as "AR1," Wisco should have been charged with illegal possession under Section 11,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Article II of R.A. No. 9165. However, the prosecution failed to charge Wisco for the said offense.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">Moreover, since Wisco sold only one sachet of shabu marked as "AR" to PO1 Rosal, his conviction, if ever, for the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A.

The dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. Essential therefore in these cases is that the identity of the prohibited drug be established beyond doubt. Be that as it may, the mere fact of unauthorized possession will not suffice to create in a reasonable mind the moral certainty required to sustain a finding of guilt. More than just the fact of possession, the fact that the substance illegally possessed in the first place is the same substance offered in court as exhibit must also be established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>The chain of custody requirement in drugs cases ensures that doubts concerning the identity of the seized drug are removed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Chain of custody is defined under Section 1 (b) of the Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002, as "the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Further, "[s]uch record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Court, in <i>People vs. Macmac Bangcola y Maki</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> reiterated the Court's previous pronouncement in <i>Mallillin vs. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> as to how the chain of custody over the seized evidence should be maintained, and the testimony needed to establish the chain of custody, thus:<br><blockquote>As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. <b>It would include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain.</b> These witnesses would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Admittedly, a testimony about a perfect chain is not always possible to obtain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> However, in cases involving drugs, jurisprudence specifically requires the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> The Court has previously explained the reason for this rule:<br><blockquote>While testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard because it is almost always impossible to obtain, <b>an unbroken chain of custody becomes indispensable and essential when the item of real evidence is not distinctive and is not readily identifiable, or when its condition at the time of testing or trial is critical, or when a witness has failed to observe its uniqueness. The same standard likewise obtains in case the evidence is susceptible to alteration, tampering, contamination and even substitution and exchange</b>. In other words, the exhibits level of susceptibility to fungibility, alteration or tampering - without regard to whether the same is advertent or otherwise not - dictates the level of strictness in the application of the chain of custody rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>As the Court has previously recognized, "[n]arcotic substances are not readily identifiable, as x x x they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature, and are prone to tampering, alteration, or substitution either by accident or otherwise."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, the Court is justified in imposing a more exacting standard before narcotic substances are accepted as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Thus, to establish the chain of custody of the seized drugs, the following links should be established: <i>first</i>, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i>second</i>, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i>third</i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and <i>fourth</i>, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as part of the chain of custody procedure, Section 21, Article II of R.A.

The prosecution could have resolved the inconsistencies in PO3 Bulosan's testimony by presenting PO2 Bacud in court. Unfortunately for the prosecution, it failed to do so.<br><br>Consequently, these inconsistencies, doubts, and lack of details on the custody of the seized drugs created a gap in the second link in the chain of custody.<br><br>As to the third link, the prosecution failed to present PO2 Bacud in court to testify on how he handled the seized drugs in his custody prior to turning them over to the crime laboratory. Further, while the parties agreed to stipulate on the testimony of PO3 Reyes that he received the seized drugs from PO2 Bacud at the crime laboratory, there was no stipulation as to how he handled the seized drugs in his custody before turning them over to the forensic chemist. Thus, the absence of testimony or stipulation as to how PO3 Reyes handled the seized drugs in his custody resulted in a gap in the third link in the chain of custody.<br><br>As to the fourth link, Forensic Chemist Police Inspector Amiely Ann Navarro testified that after she examined the seized drugs, she delivered them to PO3 John Edwin Padayao (PO3 Padayao) for safekeeping and retrieved them from PO3 Padayao thereafter for delivery to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Thus, there was a change of custody of the seized drugs which necessitated PO3 Padayao's testimony as to how he handled the drugs to preserve their identity and integrity of the seized drugs. However, PO3 Padayao did not testify in court. Consequently, absent PO3 Padayao's testimony, the Court is in serious doubt as to whether the drugs seized by PO1 Rosal from the accused are 1:he same as those brought in court.<br><br>Thus, in view of the gaps in the chain of custody and the resulting doubt as to the identity of the drugs allegedly seized from Wisco, the Court is constrained to acquit Wisco of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A.
