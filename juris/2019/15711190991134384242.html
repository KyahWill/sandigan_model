While these WTRs do indicate Ramon's particular assignments for certain weeks starting from November 8, 2013 to May 27, 2015, they do not, however, indicate that he was particularly engaged by JCDC for each of the projects stated therein, and that the duration and scope thereof were made known to him at the time his services were engaged. At best, these records only show that he had worked for such projects. By and of themselves, they do not show that Ramon was made aware of his status as a project employee at the time of hiring, as well as of the period of his employment for a specific project or undertaking.<br><br>In fact, the WTRs actually show that Ramon was engaged as an all-purpose carpenter who was made to work at JCDC's several project sites on a regular basis, as his working assignments were just re-shuffled from one project to another without any clear showing that his engagement for each project site was constitutive of a particular contract of project employment. For instance, the WTRs show that during the weeks of November 14 to 20, 2013 and November 21 to 27, 2013, Ramon was assigned at the project sites "Friedberg One Serendra East Tower" and "Repetto Shangrila" on various dates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, the following week (<i>i.e.</i>, November 28 to December 4, 2013), he was only assigned at "Repetto Shangrila."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Similarly, on April 10 to 14, 2014, he was assigned at the project "Ernest Cu."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Then, the week after (<i>i.e.</i>, April 17 to 23, 2014), he alternated between the project sites "Yakal" and "Ernest Cu."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> However, the following week (<i>i.e.</i>, April 24 to 30, 2014) he reported back to the project "Ernest Cu" and another called "Repetto Rockwell."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In all of these, it is noteworthy that no project employment contract was shown designating his engagement for each particular undertaking, much more was it demonstrated that he was informed of the scope and duration thereof. Clearly, by virtue of this pattern of re­assignment, Ramon should be deemed as a regular employee, as he was actually tasked to perform work which is usually necessary and desirable to the trade and business of his employer, and not merely engaged for a specific project or undertaking. In <i>GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the Court pointed out that if the particular job or undertaking is within the regular or usual business of the employer company and it is not identifiably distinct or separate from the other undertakings of the company such that there is clearly a constant necessity for the performance of the task in question, said job or undertaking should not be considered a project,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>In addition, if Ramon were to be considered as a project employee for each of the project sites indicated in the WTRs, then JCDC should have submitted a report of termination to the nearest public employment office every time his employment was terminated due to completion of each construction project. However, JCDC only submitted one (1) Establishment Employment Report dated October 29, 2015. In <i>Dacles v. Millenium Erectors, Corp.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court held that. "Policy Instruction No. 20 is explicit that employers of project employees are exempted from the clearance requirement but not from the submission of termination report. <b>[The Court has] consistently held that failure of the employer to file termination reports after every project completion proves that the employees are not project employees</b>[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, Ramon cannot be considered as a project employee. Hence, he was a regular employee who could only have been terminated for a just or authorized cause. However, none of these causes was properly invoked as a ground for dismissal in this case. At this juncture, it should be emphasized that Ramon's termination was by virtue of a document which he was made to sign in October 2015 indicating the termination of his project employment contract. In addition, the Establishment Employment Report dated October 29, 2015 shows that he was terminated for the cause of "project completion" and no other. Thus, insofar as this case is concerned, it would be inappropriate to pass upon JCDC's allegations that Ramon committed other company infractions as grounds to terminate his employment.<br><br>With respect to Ranil and Edwin, the Court finds that respondents also failed to establish their project employment status. Primarily, the Court finds it telling that JCDC could not even identify the specific undertakings or projects for which Ranil and Edwin were employed since their alleged hiring in 2014. Without any identifiable project or undertaking, it would necessarily follow that these two could not have been informed, at the time of their engagement, of the duration and scope thereof. Moreover, JCDC submitted an Establishment Termination Report with a List of Permanently Terminated Workers <u>Due to Closure/Retrenchment</u> which, therefore, makes it unclear if they were indeed dismissed on the ground of "project completion" same as Ramon.<br><br>Likewise, same as in Ramon's case, Ranil and Edwin's project employment contracts for their engagement were not even shown. These contracts would have shed light to what projects or undertakings they were engaged; but all the same, none were submitted. As case law holds, <b>the absence of the employment contracts puts into serious question the issue of whether the employees were properly informed of their employment status as project employees at the time of their engagement, especially if there were no other evidence offered</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In fine, Ranil and Edwin could not be considered as project employees. As such, they were regular employees who could only have been dismissed for a just or authorized cause, none of which exists. Accordingly, as the LA correctly ruled, they were illegally dismissed. Notably, the foregoing conclusion is not negated by the fact that Ranil and Edwin executed quitclaims for the reasons explained below.<br><br>In <i>Arlo Aluminum, Inc. v. Piñon, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the Court explained that:<br><blockquote>To be valid, a deed of release, waiver or quitclaim must meet the following requirements: (1) that there was no fraud or deceit on the part of any of the parties; (2) <u>that the consideration for the quitclaim is sufficient and reasonable</u>; and (3) that the contract is not contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law. Courts have stepped in to invalidate questionable transactions, especially where there is clear proof that a waiver, for instance, was obtained from an unsuspecting or a gullible person, or <u>where the agreement or settlement was unconscionable on its face</u>. A quitclaim is ineffective in barring recovery of the full measure of a worker's rights, and the acceptance of benefits therefrom does not amount to estoppel. Moreover, <u>a quitclaim in which the consideration is scandalously low and inequitable cannot be an obstacle to the pursuit of a worker's legitimate claim</u>.<br><br>It is only where there is clear proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person, or the terms of the settlement are unconscionable on its face, that the law will step in to annul the questionable transaction. But where it is shown that the person making the waiver did so voluntarily, with full understanding of what he was doing, and the consideration for the quitclaim is sufficient and reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and binding undertaking.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As above-mentioned, a quitclaim in which the consideration is scandalously low and inequitable cannot be an obstacle to the pursuit of a worker's legitimate claim. <i>This is because an obviously "lowball" consideration in a quitclaim indicates that the employee did not stand on an equal footing with the employer when he seemingly acceded to the waiver of his rights. Indeed, under ordinary circumstances, a reasonable man would not allow himself to be shortchanged into waiving all of his claims, unless he fully comprehends the consequences of such act.</i> Thus, as case law states, "[u]nless it can be established that the person executing the waiver voluntarily did so, with full understanding of its contents, and with reasonable and credible consideration, the same is not a valid and binding undertaking."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Here, the quitclaims signed by Ranil and Edwin, in consideration of P6,917.47<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and P7,290.06,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> respectively, do not appear to have been made for a reasonable and credible consideration, considering that these amounts only pertained to their 13<sup>th</sup> month pay for the year 2015, and as such, do not approximate any reasonable award (such as backwages and separation pay) that would have been awarded to them should they successfully pursue litigation. Notably, the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay is a statutory obligation of the employer under the law;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> hence, its payment is not really constitutive of any reasonable settlement as they are already entitled to the same as a matter of course. According to jurisprudence, "the burden to prove that the waiver or quitclaim was voluntarily executed is with the employer,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> which the latter failed to discharge. In view of the foregoing circumstances, the Court holds that the quitclaims were not validly executed, and hence, do not constitute an effective waiver of JCDC's liability arising from its illegal termination of Ranil and Edwin, its regular employees.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
