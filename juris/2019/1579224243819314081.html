The Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>Names are labels for one's identity. They facilitate social interaction, including the allocation of rights and determination of liabilities. It is for this reason that the State has an interest in one's name.<br><br>The name through which one is known is generally, however, not chosen by the individual who bears it. Rather, it is chosen by one's parents. In this sense, the choice of one's name is not a product of the exercise of autonomy of the individual to whom it refers.<br><br>In view of the State's interest in names as markers of one's identity, the law requires that these labels be registered. Understandably, in some cases, the names so registered or other aspects of one's identity that pertain to one's name are not reflected with accuracy in the Certificate of Live Birth filed with the civil registrar.<br><br>Changes to one's name, therefore, can be the result of either one of two (2) motives. The first, as an exercise of one's autonomy, is to change the appellation that one was given for various reasons. The other is not an exercise to change the label that was given to a person; it is simply to correct the data as it was recorded in the Civil Registry.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Under Article 407 of the Civil Code, the books in the Civil Register include "acts, events and judicial decrees concerning the civil status of persons," which are <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the facts stated there.<br><br>Entries in the register include births, marriages, deaths, legal separations, annulments of marriage, judgments declaring marriages void from the beginning, legitimations, adoptions, acknowledgments of natural children, naturalization, loss or recovery of citizenship, civil interdiction, judicial determination of filiation, voluntary emancipation of a minor, and <i>changes of name.</i><br><br><u>As stated, the governing law on changes of first name [and correction of clerical and typographical errors in the civil register] is currently Republic Act No. 10172, which amended Republic Act No. 9048. Prior to these laws, the controlling provisions on changes or corrections of name were Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code.</u><br><br>Article 376 states the need for judicial authority before any person can change his or her name. On the other hand, Article 412 provides that judicial authority is also necessary before any entry in the civil register may be changed or corrected.<br><br>Under the old rules, a person would have to file an action in court under Rule 103 for substantial changes in the given name or surname provided they fall under any of the valid reasons recognized by law, or Rule 108 for corrections of clerical errors.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Applying Article 412 of the Civil Code, <u>a person desiring to change his or her name altogether must file a petition under Rule 103 with the Regional Trial Court</u>, which will then issue an order setting a hearing date and directing the order's publication in a newspaper of general circulation. After finding that there is proper and reasonable cause to change his or her name, the Regional Trial Court may grant the petition and order its entry in the civil register.<br><br>On the other hand, <u>Rule 108 applies when the person is seeking to correct clerical and innocuous mistakes in his or her documents with the civil register.</u> It also governs the correction of substantial errors in the entry of the information enumerated in Section 2 of this Rule and those affecting the civil status, citizenship, and nationality of a person. <u>The proceedings under this rule may either be summary, if the correction pertains to clerical mistakes, or adversary, if it pertains to substantial errors.</u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Following the procedure in Rule 103, Rule 108 also requires a petition to be filed before the Regional Trial Court. The trial court then sets a hearing and directs the publication of its order in a newspaper of general circulation in the province. After the hearing, the trial court may grant or dismiss the petition and serve a copy of its judgment to the Civil Registrar.<br><br><i>Mercadera </i>clarified the applications of Article 376 and Rule 103, and of Article 412 and Rule 108, thus:<br><br><blockquote><u>The "change of name" contemplated under Article 376 and Rule 103 must not be confused with Article 412 and Rule 108</u>. A change of one's name under Rule 103 can be granted, only on grounds provided by law. In order to justify a request for change of name, there must be a proper and compelling reason for the change and proof that the person requesting will be prejudiced by the use of his official name. To assess the sufficiency of the grounds invoked therefor, there must be adversarial proceedings.<br><br>In petitions for correction, only clerical, spelling, typographical and other innocuous errors in the civil registry may be raised. Considering that the enumeration in Section 2, Rule 108 also includes "changes of name," the correction of a patently misspelled name is covered by Rule 108. Suffice it to say, not all alterations allowed in one's name are confined under Rule 103. Corrections for clerical errors may be set right under Rule 108.<br><br><u>This rule in "names." however, does not operate to entirely limit Rule 108 to the correction of clerical errors in civil registry entries by way of a summary proceeding. As explained above. </u><i><u>Republic </u></i><u>v. </u><i><u>Valencia </u></i><u>is the authority for allowing substantial errors in other entries like citizenship, civil status, and paternity, to be corrected using Rule 108 provided there is an adversary proceeding.</u> "After all, the role of the Court under Rule 108 is to ascertain the truths about the facts recorded therein." x x x<br></blockquote><br>However, <u>Republic Act No. 9048 amended Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code, effectively removing clerical errors and changes of the name outside the ambit of Rule 108 and putting them under the jurisdiction of the civil registrar.</u><br><br>In <i>Silverio </i>v. <i>Republic:</i><br><br><blockquote>The State has an interest in the names borne by individuals and entities for purposes of identification. A change of name is a privilege, not a right. Petitions for change of name are controlled by statutes. In this connection, Article 376 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 376. No person can change his name or surname without judicial authority.<br></blockquote>This Civil Code provision was amended by RA 9048 (Clerical Error Law) x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>RA 9048 now governs the <b>change of first name. </b>It </u><u>vests the power and authority to entertain petitions for change of first name to the city or municipal civil registrar or consul general concerned. Under the law, therefore, jurisdiction over applications for change of first name is now primarily lodged with the aforementioned administrative officers. The intent and effect of the law is to exclude the change of first name from the coverage of Rules 103 (Change of Name) and 108 (Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court, until and unless an administrative petition for change of name is first filed and subsequently denied. It likewise lays down the corresponding venue, form and procedure. In sum, the remedy and the proceedings regulating change of first name are primarily administrative in nature, not judicial.</u> x x x<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Republic v. Cagandahan:</i><br><br>The determination of a person's sex appearing in his birth certificate is a legal issue and the court must look to the statutes. In this connection, Article 412 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>ART. 412. No entry in a civil register shall be changed or corrected without a judicial order.<br><br><u>Together with Article 376 of the Civil Code, this provision was amended by Republic Act No. 9048 in so far as </u><i><u><b>clerical or typographical </b></u></i><u><b>errors </b>are involved. The correction or change of such matters can now be made through administrative proceedings and without the need for a judicial order. In effect, Rep. Act No. 9048 removed from the ambit of Rule 108 of the Rules of Court the correction of such errors. Rule 108 now applies only to substantial changes and corrections in entries in the civil register.</u> x x x<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Republic v. Sali:</i><br><br><blockquote>The petition for change of first name may be allowed, among other grounds, if the new first name has been habitually and continuously used by the petitioner and he or she has been publicly known by that first name in the community. The local city or municipal civil registrar or consul general has the primary jurisdiction to entertain the petition. It is only when such petition is denied that a petitioner may either appeal to the civil registrar general or file the appropriate petition with the proper court. x x x<br></blockquote><br>Republic Act No. 9048 also dispensed with the need for judicial proceedings in case of any clerical or typographical mistakes in the civil register or changes in first names or nicknames.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, a person may now change his or her <u>first name</u> or <u>correct clerical errors</u> in his or her name <u>through administrative proceedings</u>. <u>Rules 103 and 108 only apply if the administrative petition has been filed and later denied.</u><br><br>In 2012, Republic Act No. 9048 was amended by Republic Act No. 10172.<br><br>In addition to the change of the first name, the day and month of birth, and the sex of a person may now be changed without judicial proceedings. Republic Act No. 10172 clarifies that these changes may now be administratively corrected where it is patently clear that there is a clerical or typographical mistake in the entry. It may be changed by filing a subscribed and sworn affidavit with the local civil registry office of the city or municipality where the record being sought to be corrected or changed is kept.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The foregoing rules may be summarized as follows:<br><br><br>&nbsp;1.

Section 2 of the said law defines clerical or typographical errors as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(3) 'Clerical or typographical error' refers to a mistake committed in the performance of clerical work in writing, copying, transcribing or typing an entry in the civil register that is harmless and innocuous, such as <u>misspelled name</u> or misspelled place of birth, mistake in the entry of day and month in the date of birth or the sex of the person or the like, <u>which is visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding, and can be corrected or changed only by reference to other existing record or records</u>: <i>Provided, however, </i>That no correction must involve the change of nationality, age, or status of the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Evidently the test for whether a correction is clerical or substantial is found in the provision itself. Misspelled names or missing entries are clerical corrections if they are visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding <u>and</u> if they may be readily verified by referring to the existing records in the civil register.

It likewise follows that the petition should have been filed with the local civil registry office of the city or municipality where the record being sought to be corrected or changed is kept, in accordance with Section 3 of R.A. 9048 and not in accordance with the venue provided in Rule 103.<br><br>In sum, all changes sought by the petitioner fall within the ambit of R.A. 9048.
