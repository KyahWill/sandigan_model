				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Under the Tax Code, the earnings of banks from "passive" income are subject to a twenty percent final withholding tax (20% FWT).  This tax is withheld at source and is thus not <i>actually</i> and physically received by the banks, because it is paid directly to the government by the entities from which the banks derived the income. Apart from the 20% FWT, banks are also subject to a five percent gross receipts tax (5% GRT) which is imposed by the Tax Code on their gross receipts, including the "passive" income.<br><br>Since the 20% FWT is <i>constructively</i> received by the banks and forms part of their gross receipts or earnings, it follows that it is subject to the 5% GRT. After all, the amount withheld is paid to the government on their behalf, in satisfaction of their withholding taxes.  That they do not <i> actually</i> receive the amount does not alter the fact that it is remitted for their benefit in satisfaction of their tax obligations.<br><br>Stated otherwise, the fact is that if there were no withholding tax system in place in this country, this 20 percent portion of the "passive" income of banks would <i>actually</i> be paid to the banks and then remitted by them to the government in payment of their income tax.  The institution of the withholding tax system does not alter the fact that the 20 percent portion of their "passive" income constitutes part of their <i>actual</i> earnings, except that it is paid directly to the government on their behalf in satisfaction of the 20 percent final income tax due on their "passive" incomes.<br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u>The Case</u></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to annul the July 18, 2000 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup> and the May 8, 2001 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 54599.

Obviously, this amount that is used to settle the tax liability is deemed sourced from the proceeds constitutive of the tax base.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  These proceeds are either actual or constructive.  Both parties herein agree that there is no <i>actual </i> receipt by the bank of the amount withheld.  What needs to be determined is if there is <i>constructive</i> receipt thereof.  Since the payee -- not the payor -- is the real taxpayer, the rule on constructive receipt can be easily rationalized, if not made clearly manifest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Constructive Receipt<br> Versus Actual Receipt</u></i></b><br><br>Applying Section 7 of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 17-84,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> petitioner contends that there is <i>constructive</i> receipt of the interest on deposits and yield on deposit substitutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  Respondent, however, claims that even if there is, it is Section 4(e) of RR 12-80<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that nevertheless governs the situation.<br><br>Section 7 of RR 17-84 states:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7. Nature and Treatment of Interest on Deposits and Yield on Deposit Substitutes. -<br><blockquote>`(a)         The interest earned on Philippine Currency bank deposits and yield from deposit substitutes subjected to the withholding taxes in accordance with these regulations need not be included in the gross income in computing the depositor's/investor's income tax liability in accordance with the provision of Section 29(b),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [29]</sup> (c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and (d) of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.<br><br>`(b)         Only interest paid or accrued on bank deposits, or yield from deposit substitutes declared for purposes of imposing the withholding taxes in accordance with these regulations shall be allowed as interest expense deductible for purposes of computing taxable net income of the payor.<br><br>`(c)         If the recipient of the above-mentioned items of income are financial institutions, the same shall be included as part of the tax base upon which the gross receipt[s] tax is imposed.'"<br></blockquote></blockquote>Section 4(e) of RR 12-80, on the other hand, states that the tax rates to be imposed on the gross receipts of banks, non-bank financial intermediaries, financing companies, and other non-bank financial intermediaries not performing quasi-banking activities shall be based on all items of income <i> actually</i> received.  This provision reads:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 4.        x x x             x x x             x x x<br><br>"(e) Gross receipts tax on banks, non-bank financial intermediaries, financing companies, and other non-bank financial intermediaries not performing quasi- banking activities. - The rates of tax to be imposed on the gross receipts of such financial institutions shall be based on all items of income actually received. Mere accrual shall not be considered, but once payment is received on such accrual or in cases of prepayment, then the amount actually received shall be included in the tax base of such financial institutions, as provided hereunder x x x."<br></blockquote>Respondent argues that the above-quoted provision is plain and clear: since there is no <i>actual</i> receipt, the FWT is not to be included in the tax base for computing the GRT.  There is supposedly no pecuniary benefit or advantage accruing to the bank from the FWT, because the income is subjected to a tax burden immediately upon receipt through the withholding process.  Moreover, the <i>earlier</i> RR 12-80 covered matters not falling under the <i>later</i> RR 17-84.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>By analogy, we apply to the receipt of income the rules on <i>actual</i> and <i>constructive</i> possession provided in Articles 531 and 532 of our Civil Code.<br><br>Under Article 531:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><blockquote>"Possession is acquired by the material occupation of a thing or the exercise of a right, or by the fact that it is subject to the action of our will, or by the proper acts and legal formalities established for acquiring such right."<br></blockquote>Article 532 states<br><blockquote>"Possession may be acquired by the same person who is to enjoy it, by his legal representative, by his agent, or by any person without any power whatever; but in the last case, the possession shall not be considered as acquired until the person in whose name the act of possession was executed has ratified the same, without prejudice to the juridical consequences of <i> negotiorum gestio</i> in a proper case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>The last means of acquiring possession under Article 531 refers to juridical acts -- the acquisition of possession by sufficient title - to which the law gives the force of acts of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  Respondent argues that only items of income <i> actually</i> received should be included in its gross receipts.  It claims that since the amount had already been withheld at source, it did not have <i>actual</i> receipt thereof.<br><br>We clarify.  Article 531 of the Civil Code clearly provides that the acquisition of the right of possession is through the proper acts and legal formalities established therefor.  The withholding process is one such act. There may not be <i>actual</i> receipt of the income withheld; however, as provided for in Article 532, possession by any person without any power whatsoever shall be considered as acquired when ratified by the person in whose name the act of possession is executed.<br><br>In our withholding tax system, possession is acquired by the payor as the withholding agent of the government, because the taxpayer ratifies the very act of possession for the government. There is thus <i>constructive</i> receipt.  The processes of bookkeeping and accounting for interest on deposits and yield on deposit substitutes that are subjected to FWT are indeed -- for legal purposes -- tantamount to delivery, receipt or remittance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Besides, respondent itself admits that its income is subjected to a tax burden immediately upon "receipt," although it claims that it derives no pecuniary benefit or advantage through the withholding process.  There being <i>constructive</i> receipt of such income -- part of which is withheld -- RR 17-84 applies, and that income is included as part of the tax base upon which the GRT is imposed.<br><br><b><i><u>RR 12-80 Superseded by RR 17-84</u></i></b><br><br>We now come to the effect of the revenue regulations on interest income <i> constructively</i> received.<br><br>In general, rules and regulations issued by administrative or executive officers pursuant to the procedure or authority conferred by law upon the administrative agency have the force and effect, or partake of the nature, of a statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  The reason is that statutes express the policies, purposes, objectives, remedies and sanctions intended by the legislature in general terms.  The details and manner of carrying them out are oftentimes left to the administrative agency entrusted with their enforcement.<br><br>In the present case, it is the finance secretary who promulgates the revenue regulations, upon recommendation of the BIR commissioner.  These regulations are the consequences of a delegated power to issue legal provisions that have the effect of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>A revenue regulation is binding on the courts as long as the procedure fixed for its promulgation is followed.  Even if the courts may not be in agreement with its stated policy or innate wisdom, it is nonetheless valid, provided that its scope is within the statutory authority or standard granted by the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Specifically, the regulation must (1) be germane to the object and purpose of the law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (2) not contradict, but conform to, the standards the law prescribes;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and (3) be issued for the sole purpose of carrying into effect the general provisions of our tax laws. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In the present case, there is no question about the regularity in the performance of official duty.  What needs to be determined is whether RR 12-80 has been repealed by RR 17-84.<br><br>A repeal may be express or implied.  It is express when there is a declaration in a regulation -- usually in its repealing clause -- that another regulation, identified by its number or title, is repealed. All others are implied repeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> An example of the latter is a general provision that predicates the intended repeal on a substantial conflict between the existing and the prior regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>As stated in Section 11 of RR 17-84, all regulations, rules, orders or portions thereof that are inconsistent with the provisions of the said RR are thereby repealed.  This declaration proceeds on the premise that RR 17-84 clearly reveals such an intention on the part of the Department of Finance. Otherwise, later RRs are to be construed as a continuation of, and not a substitute for, earlier RRs; and will continue to speak, so far as the subject matter is the same, from the time of the first promulgation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>There are two well-settled categories of implied repeals: (1) in case the provisions are in irreconcilable conflict, the later regulation, to the extent of the conflict, constitutes an implied repeal of an earlier one; and (2) if the later regulation covers the whole subject of an earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will similarly operate as a repeal of the earlier one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  There is no implied repeal of an earlier RR by the mere fact that its subject matter is related to a later RR, which may simply be a cumulation or continuation of the earlier one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Where a part of an earlier regulation embracing the same subject as a later one may not be enforced without nullifying the pertinent provision of the latter, the earlier regulation is deemed impliedly amended or modified to the extent of the repugnancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47] </sup>  The unaffected provisions or portions of the earlier regulation remain in force, while its omitted portions are deemed repealed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  An exception therein that is amended by its subsequent elimination shall now cease to be so and instead be included within the scope of the general rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Section 4(e) of the earlier RR 12-80 provides that only items of income <i>actually</i> received shall be included in the tax base for computing the GRT, but Section 7(c) of the later RR 17-84 makes no such distinction and provides that <i>all</i> interests earned shall be included.  The exception having been eliminated, the clear intent is that the later RR 17-84 includes the exception within the scope of the general rule.<br><br>Repeals by implication are not favored and will not be indulged, unless it is manifest that the administrative agency intended them.  As a regulation is presumed to have been made with deliberation and full knowledge of all existing rules on the subject, it may reasonably be concluded that its promulgation was not intended to interfere with or abrogate any earlier rule relating to the same subject, unless it is either repugnant to or fully inclusive of the subject matter of an earlier one, or unless the reason for the earlier one is "beyond peradventure removed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  Every effort must be exerted to make all regulations stand -- and a later rule will not operate as a repeal of an earlier one, if by any reasonable construction, the two can be reconciled. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>RR 12-80 imposes the GRT only on all items of income <i>actually</i> received, as opposed to their mere <i>accrual</i>, while RR 17-84 includes <i>all</i> interest income in computing the GRT.  RR 12-80 is superseded by the later rule, because Section 4(e) thereof is not restated in RR 17-84.  Clearly therefore, as petitioner correctly states, this particular provision was impliedly repealed when the later regulations took effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Reconciling the Two Regulations</u></i></b><br><br>Granting that the two regulations can be reconciled, respondent's reliance on Section 4(e) of RR 12-80 is misplaced and deceptive.  The "accrual" referred to therein should not be equated with the determination of the amount to be used as tax base in computing the GRT.  Such accrual merely refers to an accounting method that recognizes income as earned although not received, and expenses as incurred although not yet paid.<br><br>Accrual should not be confused with the concept of <i>constructive</i> possession or receipt as earlier discussed.  Petitioner correctly points out that income that is merely <i>accrued</i> -- earned, but not yet received -- does not form part of the taxable gross receipts; income that has been received, albeit <i>constructively</i>, does.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The word "actually," used confusingly in Section 4(e), will be clearer if removed entirely.  Besides, if <i>actually</i> is that important, <i> accrual</i> should have been eliminated for being a mere surplusage.  The inclusion of <i>accrual</i> stresses the fact that Section 4(e) does not distinguish between <i>actual</i> and <i>constructive</i> receipt.  It merely focuses on the method of accounting known as the <i>accrual</i> system.<br><br>Under this system, income is accrued or earned in the year in which the taxpayer's right thereto becomes fixed and definite, even though it may not be <i>actually</i> received until a later year; while a deduction for a liability is to be accrued or incurred and taken when the liability becomes fixed and certain, even though it may not be <i>actually</i> paid until later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Under any system of accounting, no duty or liability to pay an income tax upon a transaction arises until the taxable year in which the event constituting the condition precedent occurs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  The liability to pay a tax may thus arise at a certain time and the tax paid within another given time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In reconciling these two regulations, the earlier one includes in the tax base for GRT <i>all</i> income, whether <i>actually</i> or <i>constructively </i> received, while the later one includes specifically interest income. In computing the income tax liability, the only exception cited in the later regulations is the exclusion from gross income of interest income, which is already subjected to withholding. This exception, however, refers to a different tax altogether.  To extend mischievously such exception to the GRT will certainly lead to results not contemplated by the legislators and the administrative body promulgating the regulations.<br><br><u style="font-weight: bold;">Manila Jockey Club</u><br style="font-weight: bold;"> <i style="font-weight: bold;"><u>Inapplicable</u></i><br><br>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.
