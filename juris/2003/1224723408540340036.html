During their second meeting, Aviles presented to the Spouses Firme another draft deed of sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> ("Second Draft") dated March 1995.  The Spouses Firme allegedly accepted the Second Draft in view of the deletion of the objectionable conditions contained in the First Draft.  According to Aviles, the Spouses Firme were willing to sell the Property at P4,000 per square meter. They then agreed that payment would be made at the Far East Bank and Trust Company ("FEBTC"), Padre Faura Branch, Manila.  However, the scheduled payment had to be postponed due to problems in the transfer of funds.  The Spouses Firme later informed Aviles that they were no longer interested in selling the Property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>De Castro testified that he authorized Aviles to negotiate for Bukal Enterprises the purchase of the Property owned by the Spouses Firme.  The Property was located beside the Dahlia Commercial Complex owned by Bukal Enterprises. Aviles informed him that the Spouses Firme agreed to sell the Property at P4,000 per square meter, payable in cash for a lump sum of P3,224,000. Furthermore, Bukal Enterprises agreed to pay the taxes due and to undertake the relocation of the squatters on the Property. For this purpose, Bukal Enterprises applied for a loan of P4,500,000 which FEBTC granted.  Bukal Enterprises then relocated the four families squatting on the Property at a cost of P60,000 per family.  After the squatters vacated the Property, Bukal Enterprises fenced the area, covered it with filling materials, and constructed posts and riprap. Bukal Enterprises spent approximately P300,000 for these improvements.  In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated 7 March 1995, Bukal Enterprises offered to pay the purchase price of P3,224,000 to the Spouses Firme upon execution of the transfer documents and delivery of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 264243. The Spouses Firme did not accept this offer but instead sent Bukal Enterprises a letter demanding that its workers vacate the Property.  Bukal Enterprises then filed a complaint for  specific performance and damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Antonio Moreno, one of the alleged squatters on the Property, testified that he constructed his house on the Property sometime in 1982.  On 26 February 1995, he was summoned together with the other squatters to a meeting with Aviles regarding their relocation.  They agreed to relocate provided they would be given financial assistance of P60,000 per family.  Thus, on 6 March 1995, the squatter families were each paid P60,000 in the presence of De Castro and Aviles.  Thereafter, they voluntarily demolished their  houses and vacated the Property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Jocelyn Mapa, the manager of FEBTC, Padre Faura Branch, testified that Bukal Enterprises has been their client since 1994. According to her, Bukal Enterprises applied for a loan of P4,500,000 on the third week of February 1995 allegedly to buy a lot in Fairview.  FEBTC approved the loan on the last week of February and released the proceeds on the first week of March.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Antonio Ancheta ("Ancheta"), barangay captain of Barangay Fairview, testified that he was present when one of the officers of Bukal Enterprises, a certain Renato, paid each of the four squatter families around P60,000 to P100,000.  Ancheta informed Dr. Constante Firme that he told the squatters to leave considering that they already received payment for their relocation. According to Ancheta, Dr. Constante Firme must have misunderstood him and thought that the squatters left through Ancheta's own efforts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Dr. Constante Firme ("Dr. Firme") was the sole witness for the defendant spouses.<br><br>Dr. Firme testified that on 30 January 1995, he and his wife met with Aviles at the Aristocrat Restaurant in Quezon City. Aviles arranged the meeting with the Spouses Firme involving their Property in Fairview.  Aviles offered to buy the Property at P2,500 per square meter.  The Spouses Firme did not accept the offer because they were reserving the Property for their children.  On 6 February 1995, the Spouses Firme met again with Aviles upon the latter's insistence.  Aviles showed the Spouses Firme a copy of a draft deed of sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> ("Third Draft") which Aviles prepared. The Third Draft of the deed of sale provides:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">CONRACT OF SALE<br></div><br>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:<br><br>This AGREEMENT, executed this ___ day of February, 1995, by and between the Spouses CONSTANTE FIRME and AZUCENA E.

The Spouses Firme particularly opposed the provision on the delivery of the Property's title to Bukal Enterprises for the latter to obtain a loan from the bank and use the proceeds to pay for the Property. The Spouses Firme repeatedly told Aviles that the Property was not for sale when Aviles called on 2 and 4 March 1995 regarding the Property. On 6 March 1995, the Spouses Firme visited their Property and discovered that there was a  hollow block fence on one side, concrete posts on another side and bunkers occupied by workers of a certain Florante de Castro.  On 11 March 1995, Spouses Firme visited the Property again with a surveyor. Dr. Firme talked with Ancheta who told him that the squatters had voluntarily demolished their shanties. The Spouses Firme sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated 20 March 1995 to Bukal Enterprises demanding removal of the bunkers and vacation   by the occupants of the Property. On 22 March 1995, the Spouses Firme received a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated 7 March 1995 from Bukal Enterprises demanding that they sell the Property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On 7 August 1998, the trial court rendered judgment against Bukal Enterprises as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing premises, the above-entitled case [is] hereby DISMISSED and plaintiff BUKAL ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION is hereby ordered to pay the defendants Spouses Constante and Azucena Firme:<br><ol type="1"><li>the sum of Three Hundred Thirty Five Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty Four and 90/100 (P335,964.90) as and by way of actual and compensatory damages;<br><br></li><li>the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) as and by way of moral damages;<br><br></li><li>the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as and by way of attorney's fees; and<br><br></li><li>the costs of the suit.<br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></div><br>Bukal Enterprises appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed and set aside the decision of the trial court. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision, dated August 7, 1998, is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  The complaint is granted and the appellees are directed to henceforth execute the Deed of Absolute Sale transferring the ownership of the subject property to the appellant immediately upon receipt of the purchase price of P3,224,000.00 and to perform all such acts necessary and proper to effect the transfer of the property covered by TCT No. 264243 to appellant.  Appellant is directed to deliver the payment of the purchase price of the property within sixty days from the finality of this judgment. Costs against appellees.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the instant petition.<br><b><center><br><u>The Ruling of the Trial Court</u><br></center><br></b>The trial court held there was no perfected contract of sale.  Bukal Enterprises failed to establish that the Spouses Firme gave their consent to the sale of the Property.  The parties did not go beyond the negotiation stage and there was no evidence of meeting of the minds between the parties.  Furthermore, Aviles had no valid authority to bind Bukal Enterprises in the sale transaction.  Under Sections 23 and 36 (No. 7) of the Corporation Code, the corporate power to purchase a specific property is exercised by the Board of Directors of the corporation.  Without an authorization from the Board of Directors, Aviles could not validly finalize the purchase of the Property on behalf of Bukal Enterprises. There is no basis to apply the Statute of Frauds since there was no perfected contract of sale.<br><u><b><center><br>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals<br></center><br></b></u>The Court of Appeals held that the lack of a board resolution authorizing Aviles to act on behalf of Bukal Enterprises in the purchase of the Property was cured by ratification.  Bukal Enterprises ratified the purchase when it filed the complaint for the enforcement of the sale.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also held there was a perfected contract of sale. The appellate court ruled that the Spouses Firme revealed their intent to sell the Property when they met with Aviles twice.  The Spouses Firme rejected the First Draft because they considered the terms unacceptable. When Aviles presented the Second Draft without the objectionable provisions, the Spouses Firme no longer had any cause for refusing to sell the Property.  On the other hand, the acts of Bukal Enterprises in fencing the Property, constructing posts, relocating the squatters and obtaining a loan to purchase the Property are circumstances supporting their claim that there was a perfected contract of sale.<br><br>The Spouses Firme allowed Bukal Enterprises to exercise acts of ownership over the Property when the latter introduced improvements on the Property and evicted the squatters.  These acts constitute partial performance of the contract of sale that takes the oral contract out of the scope of the Statute of Frauds.<br><b><u><center><br>The Issues<br></center><br></u></b>The Spouses Firme raise the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT THERE WAS A PERFECTED CONTRACT OF SALE BETWEEN PETITIONERS AND RESPONDENT DESPITE THE ADDUCED EVIDENCE PATENTLY TO THE CONTRARY;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE ALLEGED CONTRACT OF SALE IS ENFORCEABLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SAME IS COVERED BY THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS;<br><br></li><li>WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT LEGALLY AND FACTUALLY POSSIBLE FOR RESPONDENT TO PERFECT A CONTRACT OF SALE; AND<br><br></li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE AWARD BY THE TRIAL COURT OF MORAL AND COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO PETITIONERS IS IMPROPER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court</u></b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>The fundamental question for resolution is whether there was a perfected contract of sale between the Spouses Firme and Bukal Enterprises.  This requires a review of the factual and legal issues of this case.  As a rule, only questions of law are appealable to this Court under Rule 45<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the Rules of Civil Procedure.  The findings of fact by the Court of Appeals are generally conclusive and binding on the parties and are not reviewable by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> However, when the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court or when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, this Court has the authority to review the findings of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Likewise, this Court may review findings of fact when the judgment of the Court of Appeals is premised on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This is the situation in this case.<br><u><b><center><br>Whether there was a perfected contract of sale<br></center><br></b></u>We agree with the finding of the trial court that there was no perfected contract of sale.  Clearly, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the facts of the case in ruling otherwise.<br><br>First, the records indubitably show that there was no consent on the part of the Spouses Firme.  Aviles did not present any draft deed of sale during his first meeting with the Spouses Firme on 30 January 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Dr. Firme was consistent in his testimony that he and his wife rejected the provisions of the Third Draft presented by Aviles during their second meeting on 6 February 1995.  The Spouses Firme found the terms and conditions unacceptable and told Aviles that they would not sell the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Aviles showed them only one draft deed of sale (Third Draft) during their second and last meeting on 6 February 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> When shown a copy of the First Draft, Dr. Firme testified that it was not the deed of sale shown to them by Aviles during their second meeting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and that the Third Draft  was completely different from the First Draft.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Aviles gave conflicting testimony as to what transpired during the two meetings with the Spouses Firme.  In his direct examination, Aviles testified that during his first meeting with the Spouses Firme on 23 January 1995, he showed them the First Draft which the Spouses Firme rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On their second meeting, Aviles showed the Spouses Firme the Second Draft, which the Spouses Firme allegedly approved because the objectionable conditions contained in the First Draft were already deleted. However, a perusal of the First Draft and the Second Draft would show that both deeds of sale contain exactly the same provisions. The only difference is that the date of the First Draft is February 1995 while that of the Second Draft is March 1995.<br><br>When Aviles testified again as rebuttal witness, his testimony became more confusing.  Aviles testified that during his first meeting with the Spouses Firme on 30 January 1995, he showed them the Third Draft, which was not acceptable to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, upon further questioning by his counsel, Aviles concurred with Dr. Firme's testimony that he presented the Third Draft (Exh. "5"; Exh. "L") to  the Spouses Firme only during their second meeting. He also stated that he prepared and presented to the Spouses Firme the First Draft (Exh. "C") and the Second Draft (Exh. "C-1") during their first or second meeting. He testified:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

Where there is merely an offer by one party, without the acceptance of the other, there is no consent. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, the Spouses Firme flatly rejected the offer of Aviles to buy the Property on behalf of Bukal Enterprises.

Aviles did not have the proper authority to negotiate for Bukal Enterprises. Aviles testified that his friend, De Castro, had asked him to negotiate with the Spouses Firme to buy the Property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> De Castro, as Bukal Enterprises' vice president, testified that he authorized Aviles to buy the Property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> However, there is no Board Resolution authorizing Aviles to negotiate and purchase the Property on behalf of Bukal Enterprises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>It is the board of directors or trustees which exercises almost all the corporate powers in a corporation.

There is no Board Resolution authorizing Aviles to negotiate and purchase the Property for Bukal Enterprises.  There is also no evidence to prove that Bukal Enterprises approved whatever transaction Aviles made with the Spouses Firme.   In fact, the president of Bukal Enterprises did not sign any of the deeds of sale presented to the Spouses Firme.  Even De Castro admitted that he had never met the Spouses Firme.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Considering all these circumstances, it is highly improbable for Aviles to finalize any contract of sale with the Spouses Firme.<br><br>Furthermore, the Court notes that in the Complaint filed by Bukal Enterprises with the trial court, Aviles signed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the verification and certification of non-forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The verification and certification of non-forum shopping was not accompanied by proof that Bukal Enterprises authorized Aviles to file the complaint on behalf of Bukal Enterprises.<br><br>The power of a corporation to sue and be sued is exercised by the board of directors.

This conclusion arose from the appellate court's erroneous finding that there was a perfected contract of sale. The records show that there was no perfected contract of sale.  There is therefore no basis for the application of the Statute of Frauds. The application of the Statute of Frauds presupposes the existence of a perfected contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Article 1403 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 1403.

On 4 March 1995, Aviles called again and this time Mrs. Firme told him that they were not selling the Property.  Aviles informed De Castro of the refusal of the Spouses Firme to sell the Property.
