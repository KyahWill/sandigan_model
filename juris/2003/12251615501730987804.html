				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Leny Riovaldez was born on April 13, 1986 to the couple Eliseo and Norma Riovaldez, residents of San Diego Street, Canumay, Valenzuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The couple had another daughter, Ellen. Norma's first cousin, then 29-year-old Exequiel Mahinay ("Kuya Ese"), lived near their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> During the school year 1997-1998, Leny was already in Grade V.<br><br>At about 7:00 p.m. on August 24, 1997, Leny was playing near their house with Nonoy, Jay-R and Inday.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Leny's father was at work.  Momentarily, Exequiel arrived and told Leny to fetch water from the house of her Ate Nena, about twenty to thirty meters away.  Leny did as she was told.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exequiel then ordered Leny to look for his common-law wife, Rowena Guillero, at the house of her Ate Nena.  Leny returned and told Exequiel that Rowena was not there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exequiel ordered Leny and Nonoy to go with him to look for Rowena at the house of one Ilon.  Leny and Nonoy agreed.  Exequiel, Leny and Nonoy went to the said house but failed to find Rowena there. Exequiel and the two children decided to go home.  Exequiel told Nonoy to go ahead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> As they neared Ate Nena's house, Exequiel suddenly held Leny by the hand and dragged her to a grassy area.  Leny tried to run away but Exequiel pulled her down to the ground.  She pushed him and shouted for help, but Exequiel covered her mouth with his hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He then removed Leny's T-shirt, bra, shorts and panties, and kissed her on her lips.  He himself removed his shirt, shorts and brief, and laid on top of her. Leny tried to shout, but Exequiel choked her.  He then inserted his penis, which was already hard, into her vagina.  Leny felt pain in her vagina, and felt something hot afterwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She felt dizzy and weak.  Satiated, Exequiel then removed his penis, licked Leny's vagina and spat on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He warned Leny not to tell anyone what he had done to her.  Exequiel initially put P900 in her pocket, but took back P600. Before leaving, Exequiel threatened to kill her and her family if she reported the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Leny then put her clothes back on and went back home with Exequiel.<br><br>Leny was in the province when she received a letter from her sister Ellen that Exequiel had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> When her aunt Vilma arrived, Leny revealed that Exequiel had also raped her in Valenzuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On March 8, 1998, Leny finally told her mother Norma that she was raped by Exequiel on August 24, 1997.  Norma was furious at her daughter for not telling her about the incident much earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On May 27, 1998, Norma brought Leny to Dr. Jose Arnel Marquez, Medico-Legal Officer of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory, who forthwith subjected Leny to a genital examination and prepared a report containing the following findings:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">FINDINGS:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><u>GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL:</u></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female subject.

He testified that the charge against him was instigated by his cousin Virgilio delos Santos and Vilma Posadas.  Vilma, Leny's aunt, wanted her son to replace Exequiel as a salesman in an electrical store.  Vilma's plan was made known to him by his own employer, Raemay Co Ching.<br><br>The accused testified that on August 24, 1990, he was in his house at Vitas, Tondo, Manila, with his live-in partner Rowena Guillero and his younger sister Merly Mahinay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On September 3, 1997, he moved to No. 63 G. San Diego Street, Canumay, Valenzuela City, about twenty meters from the house of his cousin Virgilio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On October 5, 1997, at 5:30 p.m., he was with Virgilio at the latter's house playing <i>tong-its</i> with Roy Moreno.  Leny was outside playing with Virgilio's children.  The accused ordered Leny and the other children to look for his wife Rowena at No. 21-A G. San Diego Street, Canumay, Valenzuela City.  The children returned at 6:00 p.m. and told the accused that they were not able to find Rowena.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Leny and her companions asked for money to buy candy.  Since the accused had no loose change, he gave Leny and her companions a P100 bill to buy <i>tocino</i>.  As they were unable to buy any, the accused ordered them to buy eggs instead.  The children did as they were told, and the accused gave Leny P20 afterwards. Leny and her companions then asked permission to watch television in his house.  The accused agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> By 6:30 p.m., when the accused went back home to have dinner, Leny and her companions were no longer there.  He went back to Virgilio's house, and resumed playing <i>tong-its</i>.  By then, there were already many players.  Virgilio's wife, Florida, was accepting bets for the "ending" in a basketball game and it was agreed that the winner would buy beer.  The accused and the other players then had a drinking spree in front of Virgilio's house.  By midnight, the accused had consumed five glasses of beer and went back home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> When he woke up at 6:30 a.m., he took a bath.  Florida then arrived and asked him if he had given Leny some money the night before.  When he asked what the problem was, she replied that while she was looking for her own money, she discovered that Leny had P300 with her.  When she asked where the money had come from, Leny replied that it was given to her by the accused.  The accused explained that he gave Leny P20 because she and her playmates asked for money so that they could buy candy.  Florida forthwith looked for Leny and scolded her for receiving money from the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On January 11, 1998, the accused was arrested without any warrant therefor and was also charged with the rape of Ellen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>After due trial, the trial court rendered judgment on July 9, 1999, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of statutory rape, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding accused Exequiel Mahinay Guilty beyond reasonable doubt as charged, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> with the accessory penalties prescribed by the law and to pay the costs.<br><br>He is likewise ordered to indemnify the child victim the amount of P50,000.00 plus P50,000.00 moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>The accused, now the appellant, assails the decision of the trial court contending that:<br><blockquote><i>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellant avers that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt his guilt for the crime charged.  He asserts that in the crime of rape, the testimony of the offended party is ordinarily most vital and must be received with greatest caution.  The victim's testimony must be credible and must bear the stamp of truth and candor.  He contends that in this case, the testimony of the private complainant is incredible, besides being inconsistent.  He argues that it is incredible that the private complainant was able to narrate before the trial court the lurid details of her deflowerization despite her testimony on cross-examination that she lost consciousness when the appellant raped her.  He insists that the claim of the private complainant, that she shouted for thirty minutes without anybody hearing her and rushing to her succor is, likewise, incredible.  Another concoction is her claim that she was raped by the appellant for four hours. Leny could not have known that she was raped for four hours since, as testified to by her, she regained consciousness only when she was already in their house.  Moreover, on direct examination, she testified that the appellant gave her P300 after she was raped, only to contradict herself, on cross-examination, when she testified that she was given the amount before she was raped.  Because she was unconscious at the time, she could not have known that the appellant gave her P300.  The appellant contends that the trial court should have acquitted him instead of finding him guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General contends that the trial court found the testimony of Leny worthy of belief.  High respect is given to the factual findings of the trial court unless it is shown that certain facts of value have been plainly overlooked which, if considered, would affect the result of the case; no such facts were shown to have been overlooked in this case.<br><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>We note from the evidence of the prosecution that Leny was below 12 years old when the appellant had carnal knowledge of her.  Born on April 13, 1986, Leny was only eleven years and four months old at the time of the alleged rape on August 24, 1997.  Carnal knowledge of a girl under 12 years of age is statutory rape under Article 335, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code.  Such offense is established upon proof that the accused sexually violated the offended party who was under 12 years of age at the time of the sexual assault. Consent of the offended party is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Being of tender age, she is presumed not to have any will of her own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The use of force or intimidation is not an element of statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The fact that the offended party was under 12 years old at the time of the commission of the crime is an essential element of the crime and must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  It must also be alleged in the Information/criminal complaint as mandated by the Rules of Criminal Procedure which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 6. - Sufficiency of complaint or information. - A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense by the statute; the acts of omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time of the commission of the offense, and the place wherein the offense was committed.<br><br>When an offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Even if the prosecution proved beyond cavil that the victim was below 12 years old when the appellant raped her, he cannot be convicted of statutory rape if the age of the victim was not alleged in the Information because he would thereby be deprived of his right to be informed of the nature of the charge against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In this case, the prosecution was able to prove by presenting Leny's birth certificate, that she was only 11 years and 4 months old when the appellant had carnal knowledge of her.  As this was not alleged in the Information, the appellant cannot be convicted of statutory rape.  However, he may still be found guilty of rape under Article 335, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> since it was alleged in the Information that, by means of force and intimidation employed upon the person of Leny, the appellant succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<br><br>In this case, the prosecution did muster the requisite quantum of evidence that the appellant succeeded in raping Leny by using force and intimidation, thus:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td

This is because of the trial court's unique advantage of observing at close range the conduct, demeanor and deportment of the witnesses as they testify.

</tbody></table><br>There are lapses and inconsistencies in Leny's testimony, but such lapses or inconsistencies do not weaken her credibility and derail her testimony.  It is a hornbook doctrine that the testimony of a witness must be considered in its entirety and not by truncated portions or isolated passages thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Besides, it is an accepted rule that the credibility of a rape victim is not impaired by mere inconsistencies, if there are any, in her testimony.  Inconsistencies are to be expected of young victims of heinous crimes, such as Leny, who was barely 11 years old when the appellant raped her.  Protracted and grueling cross-examination of a young girl, not accustomed to public trial, may produce contradictions that may not necessarily destroy her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Error-free testimonies cannot be expected of a young witness who is recounting details of a harrowing, traumatic, humiliating, and painful experience such as rape, one which even an adult would like to bury into the deepest recesses of oblivion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>For a discrepancy or inconsistency in the testimony of a witness to serve as basis for acquittal, such must refer to the significant facts vital to the guilt or innocence of the accused for the crime charged.  An inconsistency which has nothing to do with the elements of the crime cannot be a ground for the acquittal of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Even if the offended party may have erred in some aspects of her testimony, the same does not necessarily impair her testimony nor corrode her credibility.  The modern trend of jurisprudence is that the testimony of a witness may be believed in part and disbelieved in part, depending upon the corroborative evidence and the probabilities and improbabilities of the case.  The doctrine of <i>FALSUS IN UNO FALSUS IN OMNIBUS</i> deals only with the weight of evidence and is not a positive rule of law, and the same is not an inflexible one of universal application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> What is vital is that the act of copulation be proven under any of the conditions enumerated in Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Leny erred when she testified that she was raped for four hours, lost consciousness after the appellant raped her and regained consciousness when she was already in the house.  Her testimony that the appellant put P900 in her pocket <u>after</u> raping her but took back P600 is inconsistent with her testimony that the appellant placed P900 in her pocket <u>before</u> she was raped.  This is further inconsistent with her sworn statement that the appellant placed the money in her pocket after the rape.  Such errors or inconsistencies, however, pertain only to peripheral and collateral matters and not to the essential elements of the crime charged.<br><br>The Court is convinced, as the trial court was, that the appellant is guilty of the crime charged.<br><br>First.  Leny shouted for help at the top of her voice but the appellant covered her mouth with his hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Second.  On the initial cross-examination by the appellant's counsel, Leny testified that she lost consciousness after the appellant had raped her,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and on redirect examination, Leny testified that she merely felt dizzy but did not lose consciousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, she was still conscious when the appellant undressed her and inserted his penis into her vagina.  She felt pain and even felt the appellant licking her vagina with his tongue and saw him spit on her private parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It was only after the appellant had consummated his sexual assault on Leny that the latter felt dizzy on account of the pain she was feeling and her persistent struggling.  It bears stressing that the appellant was 29 years old while Leny was only an 11-year-old wisp of a girl.<br><br>Third.  Whether the appellant gave P300 before or after the rape is immaterial.  The evidence on record inscrutably shows that the appellant intimidated Leny and forced her to submit to his lustful desires.<br><br>Fourth.  Whether Leny lost consciousness or became dizzy before or after the appellant gave her P300 is, likewise, irrelevant because by then, she had already been raped by the appellant, and the crime had already been consummated.  Significantly, even the appellant admitted that he gave money to Leny, although he claimed that he gave her P20 with which to buy candies.<br><br>Fifth.  Leny was merely 11 years old when she was raped by no less than her uncle.  It is inconceivable for a young girl, inexperienced with the ways of the world, to fabricate a charge of defloration, undergo a medical examination of her private parts, subject herself to public ridicule and tarnish her family's honor and reputation unless she was motivated by a potent desire to seek justice for the outrageous wrong committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is highly absurd that Leny would concoct a reprehensible story of rape, undergo the scandal of a public trial, recount the ugly details of her harrowing experience, and be subjected to harassment, embarrassment and humiliation during grueling cross-examination unless she was indeed raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The trial court awarded to Leny P50,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages, but failed to award exemplary damages.
