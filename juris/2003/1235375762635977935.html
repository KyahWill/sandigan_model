Danly woke up when she felt someone fondling her private parts.&nbsp; She saw that it was appellant fondling her.&nbsp; Appellant then told Danly not to make any noise otherwise he would kill her. Thereafter, appellant covered Danly's mouth with his hand, removed her shortpants and t-shirt, spread Danly's legs, and raped her.&nbsp; Danly felt pain at the penetration.&nbsp; This was, however, already the second time appellant raped Danly.&nbsp; The first rape occurred on March 25, 1998 which is the subject of another appeal taken by appellant before this Honorable Court, Third Division in G.R. No. 144994 (pp. 11-12, tsn, November 12, 1998).<br><br>On April 12, 1998, appellant figured in a stabbing incident and was brought to the Rodriguez Hospital. Appellant insisted that Danly should stay and look after him there.&nbsp; A neighbor of Danly's mother saw both appellant and victim at the hospital by chance.&nbsp; The neighbor reported this matter to Dolores, Danly's mother, because the latter has been looking for her young children all this time.&nbsp; Upon learning of this information, Dolores went to the hospital and fetched Danly (p. 18, ibid.; p. 12, tsn, August 5, 1999).<br><br>Thereafter, Danly told her mother that appellant raped her.&nbsp; They promptly went to the police authorities in Pasig City to file the corresponding complaint against appellant herein.&nbsp; Appellant was arrested on April 13, 1998 (p. 3, tsn, January 14, 1999).<br><br>Minor victim Danly submitted herself for genital examination.&nbsp; According to Tomas D. Suguitan, M.D., the medico-legal officer who prepared the Medico-Legal Report dated April 14, 1998, the following are the results of this examination:<br><br><u>FINDINGS:</u><br><br><u>GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL:</u><br><br>Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female subject.&nbsp; Breasts are conical with pinkish brown areola and nipples from which no secretions could be pressed.&nbsp; Abdomen is flat and soft.<br><br><u>GENITAL:</u><br><br>There is scanty growth of pubic hair.&nbsp; Labia majora are full, convex and coaptated, with the pinkish brown labia minora presenting in between. On separating the same disclosed an elastic, fleshy-type with deep healed laceration at 3 o'clock position. External vaginal orifice offers strong resistance to the introduction of the examining index finger.&nbsp; Vaginal canal is narrow with prominent rugosities. Cervix is firm and closed.<br><br><u>CONCLUSION:</u><br><br>Subject is in non-virgin state physically.<br><br>There are no external signs of application of any form of violence.<br><br>(Exh. "H" for the prosecution)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><i><center><b><u>Version of the Defense</u></b></center></i><br>The defense likewise presented three witnesses: (1) Romualdo Bernardino, (2) Juvelyn Laureto, and (3) appellant Redante Santos.<br><br>The Public Attorney summarized the defense's version as follows: <br><blockquote>ROMUALDO BERNARDINO, a resident of Libis Concepcion, Marikina City testified on April 9, 1998 at 6:00 o'clock in the morning, accused-appellant, together with private complainant and the latter's little sister arrived in his house in order to borrow One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) from him.&nbsp; As security for the loan, accused-appellant pledged the T.V. set owned by his mother, who resides in Antipolo. At around 7:00 o'clock in the morning, they proceeded to Antipolo to get the T.V. set.&nbsp; They arrived therein at around 10:00 o'clock in the morning. They were back at noon in Marikina. Later in the afternoon, accused-appellant and the two (2) girls returned to Bernardino's house. Accused-appellant told herein witness that they were hiding from Danly's mother because they were not in good terms with each other.&nbsp; At around 7:00 o'clock in the evening, Bernardino accompanied them to the house of his sister-in-law where they slept.&nbsp; After about a month, herein witness learned that accused-appellant was charged of rape.&nbsp; (TSN, March 29, 1999, pp. 2-21)<br><br>JUVELYN LAURETO, 14 years of age and a resident of Tumana, Concepcion, Marikina, testified that on April 9, 1998 at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, accused-appellant together with private complainant Danly Santos and her sister arrived in their house. At around 10:00 o'clock after eating supper and playing cards, they slept side by side with each other near the kitchen area.&nbsp; She recalled that she was not able to sleep well that night, because Danly's sister suffered asthma and she had to wake up to give her a glass of water.&nbsp; She saw that accused-appellant and private complainant were taking turns in massaging and rubbing the back of the child so that the latter would feel better.&nbsp; (TSN, June 30, 1999, pp. 2-13)<br><br>Accused-appellant REDANTE SANTOS testified that, on April 9, 1998 at about 6:00 o'clock in the morning, he, together with private complainant Danly Santos and her little sister went to the house of his friend, Romualdo Bernardino and obtained from the latter a loan in the sum of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00).&nbsp; As security for the said loan, he pledged the T.V. set of his mother, which they picked up in Antipolo.&nbsp; They arrived thereat at around 10:00 o'clock in the morning and was able to return to Marikina by noon.&nbsp; Accused-appellant and the two (2) girls stayed in the town of Marikina at the Sports Center until late in the afternoon.&nbsp; They spotted private complainant's mother in the area so the three of them went into hiding.&nbsp; They returned to Bernardino's house and requested if they could spend the night therein but the latter refused.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Bernardino accompanied them into a nearby house of his sister-in-law where accused-appellant and the two (2) girls spent the night. They woke at around 5:30 in the morning and left right after eating their breakfast. &nbsp;<br><br>On April 12, 1998 at around 3:30 in the afternoon, accused-appellant figured in a stabbing incident and was confined at the Rodriguez Hospital.&nbsp; When Dolores came to visit, she saw Danly taking care of the accused-appellant.&nbsp; Dolores got mad and forcibly took Danly with her.&nbsp; The following day, April 13, 1998, accused-appellant was arrested and detained at the Pasig Police Station. (TSN, August 5, 1999, pp. 2-23)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The trial court gave full faith and credence to the evidence of the prosecution. The trial court found that the prosecution sufficiently established the following facts:<br><blockquote><ol><li>On April 9, 1998, private complainant Danly Santos y Gonzales was 12 years and 7 months old.<br><br></li><li>Accused Redante Santos y Cruz is the stepfather of Danly Santos.<br><br></li><li>On April 9, 1998, at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, in the house of accused in Manggahan, Pasig City, accused had carnal knowledge of Danly Santos by using force and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Appellant raised the defense of alibi and asserted that Danly's mother Dolores merely fabricated the charge against him. On this, the trial court stated:<br><br>Accused was positively identified by Danly Santos as the person who raped her, so that accused's defense of alibi is unavailing.<br><blockquote>Accused's assertion that the charge against him was fabricated by his wife and the latter's relatives because they have a grudge against him, finds no support in the record.&nbsp; Even assuming <i>in gratia argumenti</i> that accused's wife and his in-laws disliked and hated him, it is unthinkable and definitely inconsistent with human experience that they would utilize as instrument of revenge their own flesh and blood, a young and innocent girl, and consign her to a life of shame, embarrassment and ridicule.<br><br>The prosecution has sufficiently overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Thus, the trial court rendered a judgment of conviction on 18 October 1999. The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused REDANTE SANTOS Y CRUZ Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, as charged in the Amended Information and defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, better known as the Death Penalty Law, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of Death, and indemnify the victim Danly Santos y Gonzales the sum of P50,000.00, plus the costs of suit. <br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b></center><br>Appellant seeks the reversal of his conviction by contending that:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING ON APPELLANT THE DEATH PENALTY DESPITE THE FAILURE BY THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE WITH CERTAINTY THE ALLEGED RELATIONSHIP OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WITH APPELLANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The Court sustains the conviction of appellant, but the correct penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and not death. <br><br>We agree with the trial court that the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt appellant's guilt for the crime of rape. <br><br>This Court has consistently observed the following guidelines in deciding rape cases:&nbsp; (1) to accuse a man of rape is easy, but to disprove the accusation is difficult even if the accused is innocent; (2) since rape usually involves only two persons, the testimony of the complainant must be examined with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and should not draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape.

Many persons convicted of rape have attributed the charges against them to family feuds, resentment, or revenge.&nbsp; However, such supposed motives have never swayed the Court from lending full credence to the testimony of a rape victim who remained steadfast throughout her direct and cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It is unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as a battering ram to extract revenge, especially if it will subject them to disgrace and humiliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> No mother in her right mind would expose her daughter to the stigma and trauma resulting from a prosecution for rape if she did not have a genuine desire to seek justice against the person responsible for her daughter's defilement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Appellant also asserted that he could not have raped Danly on 9 April 1998 as they were actually in Marikina and not in Pasig on this&nbsp; date and he had witnesses to prove such fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Danly refuted this, stating that they were in Marikina on 7 April 1998 and that they were in Pasig on 9 April 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Even if appellant and Danly were in Marikina on 9 April 1998, such fact does not preclude the commission of the crime of rape. It is sufficient that the information alleges that the crime was committed on or about a specific date since time is not a material element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The death penalty imposed by the trial court on appellant is not correct.&nbsp; Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, states:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Article 266-B. <i>Penalties. </i>— x x x<br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim; x x x.</blockquote>To justify imposing the death penalty in this case, the qualifying circumstances of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender must be specifically alleged in the Information and proven during the trial. <br><br>The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which took effect on 1 December 2000, expressly require both qualifying and aggravating circumstances to be specifically alleged in the Information. Sections 8 and 9, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provide: <br><blockquote>SECTION 8. <i>Designation of the offense. </i>— The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances. If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.<br><br>SECTION 9. <i>Cause of the accusation. </i>— The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances and for the court to pronounce judgment. </blockquote>The prosecution bears the burden of establishing the qualifying circumstances that characterize the offense as qualified rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The concurrence of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender, as a qualifying circumstance that increases the penalty to death, should be alleged in the Information to warrant imposing the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Where the prosecution fails to allege and prove minority and relationship, which transform rape to its qualified state, the accused should only be held liable for the crime of simple rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> prevents his conviction for a crime that is not adequately described in the Information.<br><br>For the qualifying circumstance of minority to be appreciated, it must be alleged in the Information and proved beyond reasonable doubt. There must be independent evidence proving the age of the victim, other than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses and the absence of denial by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In this case, the prosecution presented Danly's birth certificate to show that she was born on 11 September 1985. Hence, when appellant raped Danly on 9 April 1998, she was only 12 years and almost 7 months old. &nbsp;<br><br>The relationship between a stepfather and a stepdaughter assumes the existence of a legitimate relationship, that is, the stepfather should be legally married to the stepdaughter's mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In contrast, a common-law husband is not legally married to his common-law wife.&nbsp; If such common-law wife has a daughter by another man, the daughter is not a stepdaughter of the common-law husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> A common-law husband is subject to punishment by death if he commits rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> against his common-law wife's daughter by another man.&nbsp; However, the death penalty cannot be imposed on the common-law husband if the relationship alleged in the information is that of a stepfather and stepdaughter, and what is proven is the relationship between a common-law husband and the daughter of his common-law wife by another man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The prosecution failed to establish the relationship of Danly as the stepdaughter of appellant since the prosecution did not offer in evidence the marriage certificate between appellant and Danly's mother.&nbsp; If appellant and Danly's mother were not legally married, a common-law relationship between appellant and Danly's mother would obviously exist.&nbsp; However, the Information did not allege a common-law relationship between appellant and Danly's mother but rather a legitimate relationship since the Information described Danly as appellant's stepdaughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <br><br>The prosecution even tampered with the original copy of Danly's birth certificate to make it appear that appellant and Danly's mother, Dolores Santos, are married to each other.&nbsp; This would have justified that "Dante Santos," instead of "Danilo Esmouth," is the registered father of Danly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The prosecution, however, failed to present the marriage contract between appellant and Dolores Santos.&nbsp; References by Dolores Santos and Danly to appellant as the stepfather of Danly, and references by appellant to Dolores as his "wife," cannot be considered as evidence of the legality of the union between appellant and Dolores.&nbsp; Neither can such references be considered as evidence of the legality of the stepfather-stepdaughter relationship between appellant and Danly. <br><br>Because of the disparity between the facts alleged in the Information and the facts proven in court on the real relationship between appellant and Danly, we cannot hold appellant liable for qualified rape but only for simple rape. Hence, <i>reclusion perpetua, </i>and not death, is the correct penalty.<br><br>We affirm the trial court's award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, following prevailing jurisprudence in rape cases. We also award P50,000.00 as moral damages, which in rape cases may be awarded to the victim without need of pleading or proof of its basis.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 18 October 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 166, in Criminal Case No. 114100-H, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>.
