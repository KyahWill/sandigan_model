				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court on automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Marikina City, Branch 272, convicting appellants Alma Bisda and Generosa "Jenny Rose" Basilan, of kidnapping for ransom; sentencing each of them to the extreme penalty of death by lethal injection, and ordering them to indemnify the parents of the victim Angela Michelle Soriano the amount of P100,000 as moral damages, and to pay the costs of the suit.<br><br><center><u>The Case</u></center><br>In an Amended Information docketed as Criminal Case No. 98-2647-MK, the appellants were charged with the felony of kidnapping for ransom committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 3rd of September 1998, in the City of Marikina, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and helping one another, did there and then willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly kidnap, detain and deprive ANGELA MICHELLE SORIANO y SAN JUAN of her liberty for six (6) days for the purpose of extorting ransom from her/or her family.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned, the appellants, assisted by counsel, entered separate pleas of not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><center><u>The Evidence for the Prosecution</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></center><br>William Soriano, a training consultant by profession, and his wife Marymae Soriano, had two children: Kathleen Denise and Angela Michelle. They rented a house at No. <i>5 </i>Col. Divino St., Concepcion, Marikina. Their landlady who lived nearby had a telephone with number 942-49-18.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> During the school year 1997-1998, then five-year-old Angela was in Prep at the Mother of Divine Providence School in Marikina Heights, Marikina City. The couple employed Lea and Wendy Salingatog as the <i>yayas </i>of their children. Angela met appellant Jenny Rose Basilan when the latter visited her niece Wendy in the Soriano residence. Jenny Rose was, thus, no stranger to Angela.<br><br>About 11:00 a.m. on September 3, 1998, Angela's classes had just ended and she was on her way to her school bus which was parked outside the school campus near the exit gate. She was in her school uniform and wore black shoes. Unknown to Angela, appellants Alma and Jenny Rose were outside of the school gate waiting for her. When they saw Angela, Alma and Jenny Rose proceeded to the gate and showed a visitor's gate pass to the security guard. They approached the young girl, and told her that her parents were waiting for her at the Jollibee Restaurant. Angela initially refused to go with the two women, but because Alma held on to her hand so tightly and poked a knife at her, Angela had no choice but to go with them. They rode a tricycle and went to the Jollibee Restaurant where Jenny Rose ordered spaghetti for Angela. When Angela did not see her parents, she wondered why she went with Jenny Rose and Alma in the first place. With Angela in tow, Alma and Jenny Rose boarded a white taxi and went to a "dirty house" where they changed Angela's clothes. The girl was made to wear blouse and shorts, yellow t-shirt and a pair of panties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><sup> </sup>Alma and Jenny Rose took her earrings. They fed her with the spaghetti they earlier bought at the restaurant. Alma then left, leaving Angela and Jenny Rose in the house.<br><br>Jenny Rose sent Angela to sleep, and after a while, Alma returned. When Angela woke up, Alma and Jenny Rose served her <i>merienda </i>and allowed her to watch television. Henceforth, Angela was kept in the house. At one time, Alma and Jenny Rose tied up Angela's hands and feet, and placed scotch tape on her mouth. Angela was sometimes left alone in the house but the door was kept locked. To pass the time, Angela watched television and made drawings. Jenny Rose and Alma did not fail to feed and bathe Angela. Angela did not call her parents through the telephone number of their landlady.<br><br>In the meantime, when William arrived home shortly before noon on that day, Lea and Wendy told him that Angela had not yet arrived home from school. He rushed to the school to fetch Angela, but was informed by the school security guard that his daughter had already been picked up by two women, one of whom was registered in the visitor's slip as Aileen Corpuz. Because he did not know anyone by that name, William immediately proceeded to the registrar's office to verify the information, only to find out that "Aileen Corpuz" had earlier inquired at the said office about the possibility of transferring Angela to another school. The school staff panicked when William demanded to know how unknown persons were able to get his daughter. He then started calling his friends and relatives to help him locate Angela. He also sought the help of Rizza Hontiveros, a TV personality who promised to relay his plea to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF). The school staff also reported the incident to the Marikina Police Force which dispatched a team of investigators to the Soriano residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>When apprised of the incident, the PAOCTF organized a team headed by then Chief Inspector Ricardo Dandan with SPO4 Tito Tuanggang, SPO1 Charles Larroza and civilian agent George Torrente, as members, to conduct surveillance operations and to recover the victim and arrest the culprits. The team proceeded to the Soriano residence and to Angela's school to conduct an initial investigation.<br><br>At about 6:00 a.m. on September 4, 1998, William's landlady went to his apartment to tell him that a lady had called up earlier and left a message for him: <i>"Pakisabi na lang kay Mr. Soriano na kakausapin ko siya bukas ng umaga." </i>When the landlady asked who the caller was, the voice replied, <i>"Hindi na importante iyon."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><i><sup> </sup></i>William thereafter convinced his landlady to have her telephone set transferred to his residence to facilitate communication with his daughter's abductors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Shortly before midnight that same day, George arrived at the Soriano residence and asked William if the kidnapper had already made contact. William responded that a woman had earlier called, through his landlady. George then instructed William to prolong the conversation should the kidnapper call again, to enable the agents to establish the possible location of the caller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On September <i>5, </i>1998 at around 9:25 p.m., William received a call from an unidentified woman who told him, <i>"Kung gusto mo pang makita yong anak mo, maghanda ka ng </i>five million pesos." He replied, <i>"Saan naman ako kukuha ng </i>five million? <i>Alam mo naman na nakatira lang ako sa </i>apartment." The caller said, <i>"Hindi ko masasagotyan. Tatanungin ko na lang sa aking mga boss." </i>William informed George of his conversation with the caller. George relayed the information by means of a hand-held radio to the other PAOCTF operatives standing by.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On September 7, 1998, at about 11:25 a.m., Marymae received a telephone call from a woman demanding for ransom money. The caller called two more times, at 7:00 p.m. and at 9:26 p.m. Marymae pleaded with the caller to reduce the ransom money to P25,000, or if that was not possible, to an amount not exceeding P50,000. The caller said, <i>"Hindi ko masasagot iyan. Dadaihin na lang namin ang bata sa boss namin." </i>Marymae relayed the conversation to William, their other daughter Kathleen and to George.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>At about noon that day, PAOCTF Chief of Operations Superintendent Michael Ray Aquino received a call from an anonymous source informing him that a woman who had talked about a ransom and had acted in a suspicious manner was spotted at the MSC Freight Service office located at No. 1303 Paz Street, Paco, Manila. Acting on the information, Ricardo, Charles, Tito and other PAOCTF operatives swooped down on the place and saw a woman, who turned out to be Alma Bisda, emerging from a small house at No. 1258 Paz Street, some fifty meters or so away from the said office. She had just bought food from an adjacent store at No. 1246 Paz Street, Paco, Manila. Surveillance operations were thereafter conducted.<br><br>At about 3:40 p.m. on September 8, 1998, George and Charles were at the Soriano residence. Ricardo and Tito were in the periphery of Alma's house, monitoring her whereabouts and movements. Alma again left her house and after locking the door, went to the small store nearby. She lifted the telephone and called someone. The telephone in the Soriano residence rang. When William lifted the receiver, he heard a voice similar to that of the woman who had called him the first time. The caller was asking where the money was. William told her that the P25,000 was ready, to which she replied, <i>"Hindi ko masasagot iyan, dadalhin na lang namin ang bata sa aking boss." </i>William told the caller that he was willing to give P50,000 but pleaded that he be given ample time to produce the money. The woman reiterated: <i>"Hindi ko masasagot iyan.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Ricardo and Tito heard the sound of a car horn blowing while Alma was using the telephone. Tito called up Charles and inquired whether he (Charles) heard the same sound while William was talking to the caller. After William hung up the telephone, he told George that he could hear the horn off a car blowing in the background. George then called up Ricardo by phone and relayed the information. When George inquired if Ricardo heard the sound of the horn of a car while Alma was talking over the telephone, Ricardo replied in the affirmative. The PAOCTF operatives concluded that Alma was the kidnapper.<br><br>After making the call, Alma hung up the telephone and returned to her house. The PAOCTF operatives followed. When Alma unlocked the door to the house, the operatives accosted her. She tried to escape, to no avail. Tito heard the cry of a child coming from inside the house, pleading for help: <i>"Tita ilabas mo ako!"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><i><sup> </sup></i>He rushed to the house and saw the victim Angela. He then carried her outside to safety. The agents searched the house for evidence and found a pair of black shoes, a pair of panties, a yellow shirt, a set of blouse and shorts with red, yellow and white stripes. The evidence was placed in a plastic bag.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><sup> </sup>The victim and the suspects were thereafter brought to the PAOCTF office for proper documentation.<br><br>When informed that his daughter had already been rescued, William rushed to the PAOCTF headquarters where he and Angela were reunited. Angela identified Alma as her kidnapper. When William asked Alma why she kidnapped Angela and what she would do with the one-million-peso ransom she was demanding, she replied: <i>"Kuya, wag kang maghusga, pareho lang tayong biktima." </i>When William asked Alma: <i>"Biktima, saan?" </i>Alma replied: <i>"Ang anak ko, kinidnap din nila."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><i></i><br><br>Chief Inspector Dandan turned over to Evidence Custodian P02 Joseph Bagsao, the pieces of evidence contained in a blue Shoe Mart (SM), plastic bag which the operatives found in Alma's house: a pair of black shoes, a pair of panties, a yellow shirt, a set of white blouse and shorts with red, yellow and white stripes, all of which were sized to fit a child of 4 to 7 years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On October 19, 1998, an Information for kidnapping for ransom was filed against Alma and Jane Doe.<br><br>On October 26, 1998, at around 11:00 a.m., Jenny Rose arrived at the PAOCTF Headquarters in Camp Crame, and proceeded to P02 Joseph Bagsao's office where she announced<sup> </sup>that she was one of Alma's cohorts. P02 Bagsao took Jenny Rose's fingerprints and entered the data in a fingerprint index card.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Jenny Rose was thereafter placed in a police line-up. Angela, who arrived at the PAOCTF office with her father, identified Jenny Rose as one of her kidnappers. Police Chief Inspector Atty. Aurelio C. Trampe, Jr., the Legal and Investigation Division Chief of the PAOCTF, later referred Jenny Rose to the Office of the City Prosecutor of Marikina City, for preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The prosecutor later amended the Information by deleting the name Jane Doe and substituting the name Jenny Rose Basilan y Payan as the second accused.<br><br><u>Alma's Evidence</u><br><br>Alma denied having kidnapped Angela for ransom. She testified that she was married, and a resident of Block 38, Lot 38, G. Maliputo Street, Phase II, Area 4, Kaunlaran Village, Navotas, Metro Manila. She was a businesswoman who ran a local employment agency for household help. She was also engaged in the business of buying and selling <i>palay </i>grains. Her local employment agency was located in Navotas. She had another office at No. 1258 Paz Street, Paco, Manila, which served as a <i>bodega </i>for items she sent to the province, as well as items she purchased. She had an adopted daughter named Mary Rose, who, in September 1998, studied at Harris School in Antipolo. She had employed Wendy Salingatog for a time as the <i>yaya </i>of her adopted daughter. Alma was then residing in V. Luna Street, Quezon City.<br><br>Alma employed Jenny Rose as secretary in her employment agency. In payment for services rendered, Jenny Rose was sent to school at the Lyceum of the Philippines to study B.S. Business Administration. She was also given an allowance.<br><br>In September 1998, Alma was looking for a school run by nuns that would be willing to accept her adopted daughter in the middle of the school year. Jenny Rose suggested the Divine Providence School in Marikina City. In the morning of September 3, 1998, Jenny Rose brought her to the said school. They proceeded to the administration office where Alma inquired if the school would allow her adopted daughter to enroll. When Jenny Rose and Alma were about to leave, a little girl, who turned out to be Angela, approached them and asked what Jenny Rose was doing in her school. Jenny Rose introduced Angela to Alma as her niece, and informed Alma that she would be bringing Angela with her to her boarding house in España Street.<br><br>At that point, Alma asked Jenny Rose and Angela if they wanted to eat. When they agreed, the three of them proceeded to the Jollibee Restaurant near the Meralco office in Marikina City. After eating, Alma bade them goodbye and was about to leave for her office when Jenny Rose asked if she and Angela could come along with her to Cubao. She acceded to the request, and they rode a Tamaraw FX taxi. Because Angela was getting sleepy, Alma offered to bring them to Jenny's boarding house in España, and dropped them off there. Alma thereafter proceeded to her office at 1258 Paz St., Paco, Manila, where she had been holding office since January 1997, and arrived thereat at about 2:00 p.m.<br><br>At or about 8:00 p.m. of the same day, Alma passed by Jenny Rose's boarding house to give her instructions on what to do the following day. She saw Angela crying profusely. She told Jenny Rose to bring Angela home, but Jenny Rose told her that Angela's parents would be coming to fetch her. Thinking that Angela was probably bored, Alma suggested that they stay in her office in Paco so that they could watch television while waiting for Angela's parents. Jenny Rose agreed. They arrived at the said office at around 8:40 p.m. Alma left at around 10:00 p.m. and went home to her rented house in Palmera Homes, Antipolo, where she stayed until September 6, 1998.<br><br>On September 7, 1998, at around 12:00 noon, Alma arrived at her office in Paco, Manila, and found that Jenny Rose and Angela were still there. Jenny Rose assured Alma that Angela would be fetched by her parents. At around 4:00 p.m., Alma instructed Jenny Rose to go to the province to collect some debts, Jenny Rose left for the province on the same day. Alma stayed in the office because she was having her menstrual period at the time and was not feeling well. She took care of Angela while Jenny Rose was away.<br><br>The next day, September 8, 1998, Alma was still in her office with Angela. At about 3:00 p.m., while she was watching television with Angela, someone knocked at the door. When she opened it, two male persons entered. One of them was Inspector Ricardo Dandan who showed her a photograph of Angela and asked if she knew the child. Alma answered in the affirmative. Ricardo then asked her, "Don't you know that this is kidnapping?" to which Alma replied, "I do not know." She also told Dandan that she did not know what was happening to her. Suddenly, Alma was handcuffed. Angela cried and asked Alma: "What are they doing to you, Tita?" She was brought to Camp Crame where she was interrogated and detained. Alma did not make any telephone calls that day. William, Marymae and Angela arrived at Alma's detention cell. When Angela saw her, the girl tried to run to Alma but William held on to his daughter. William asked Alma why she took Angela, Alma replied that it was Jenny Rose who brought the girl along with them. She told William that they were both victims.<br><br>Sometime on October 26, 1998, Jenny Rose visited Alma to ask for forgiveness and to assume full responsibility for the incident. Jenny Rose also informed her that she wanted to ask forgiveness from the Sorianos so that she could finish her schooling. It was only then that she realized what Jenny Rose had done to her. Nevertheless, she still believed that Jenny Rose was a good person. She advised her to go home and continue with her studies.<br><br>When Angela's sworn statement was shown to her, Alma noticed that Angela did not mention Jenny Rose as one of the two persons who had kidnapped her. Alma executed a handwritten statement denying the truth of the contents of Angela's affidavit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><u>Jenny Rose's Evidence</u><br><br>Jenny Rose did not testify in her defense. She presented Atty. Aurelio Trampe, Jr. as her witness who testified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that he was the Legal and Investigation Division Chief of the PAOCTF. On October 26, 1998, he interviewed Jenny Rose when the latter surrendered to the task force. Jenny Rose insisted that she wanted to help Alma and get all the blame for the kidnapping. She wanted to admit her participation in the crime, and volunteered the information that she and Alma kidnapped Angela. Atty. Trampe, Jr. wrote a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><sup> </sup>to the Department of Justice requesting for her inclusion in the ongoing preliminary investigation. He believed that it would be more appropriate for the prosecutor handling the case to investigate and determine whether Jenny Rose was the Jane Doe referred to in the complaint. Atty. Trampe, Jr. admitted, however, that aside from the voluntary surrender of Jenny Rose, he did not have any other evidence to include her as one of the suspects in the case. Further, he did not provide a lawyer for Jenny Rose because he did not intend to conduct an exhaustive interrogation, and he knew that even if she admitted her participation, the statement would not be admitted as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Jenny Rose adduced in evidence the letter of Atty. Trampe, Jr. to prove that she voluntarily surrendered and that there was lack of evidence against her.<br><br>On September 16, 1999, the trial court rendered judgment, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the accused ALMA BISDA y GAUPO and GENEROSA BASILAN y PAYAN are hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom penalized under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659 and is sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of DOUBLE DEATH by lethal injection, the two accused having conspired in the commission thereof. They are further ordered to pay solidarily the parents of the victim the amount of P100,000.00 as moral damages, and costs of the suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The assigned errors ascribed by the appellants to the trial court may be synthesized, thus: (a) the trial court erred in convicting the appellants of kidnapping; (b) the trial court erred in sentencing the appellants to double death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Court will delve into and resolve the issues simultaneously.<br><br><i>The prosecution adduced</i><br><i>proof beyond reasonable</i><br><i>doubt that the appellants</i><br><i>kidnapped the victim.</i><br><br>The appellants aver that the prosecution failed to muster proof, beyond reasonable doubt that, they kidnapped and illegally detained Angela. Angela in fact voluntarily went with them, and she was free to roam around the house, and to call her parents through the telephone of their landlady which Angela knew by heart.<br><br>There is no proof beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants conspired to kidnap Angela. Appellant Bisda avers that she is guilty only of slight illegal detention under Article 268 of the Revised Penal Code because (a) Angela stayed in her office for only three days; and (b) the circumstance of a female offender and a female offended party is not one of those included in the definition of kidnapping or serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the RPC.<br><br>The trial court's reliance on Angela's testimony is misplaced because the records do not show that Angela had the capacity to distinguish right from wrong when she testified in open court. The appellants point out that she was merely six years old at the time. Although Angela took an oath before she testified, the trial judge failed to ask any questions to determine whether or not she could distinguish right from wrong, and comprehend the obligation of telling the truth before the court. Hence, one of the standards in determining the credibility of a child witness was not followed. There is, thus, a veritable doubt that Angela told the truth when she testified.<br><br>Moreover, Angela's testimony is, besides being inconsistent on material points, contrary to ordinary human experience. Angela did not shout or cry when she was forced to leave the school premises and brought to the Jollibee Restaurant. Angela could have easily sought help from the security guard at the exit gate of the school and from the customers in the restaurant, or even from the tricycle and taxi drivers; but Angela did not. Angela even admitted that she voluntarily went with the appellants. She did not cry while detained in the office of appellant Bisda, and even admitted that it was only that time when she was rescued that she cried. The conduct of Angela, the appellants insist, is contrary to ordinary human experience, knowledge and observation. By her own admission in her sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><sup> </sup>to the PAOCTF agents, Angela was assisted by her parents while she was giving the said statement. This raised doubts as to the veracity of her testimony.<br><br>The contentions of the appellants are bereft of merit.<br><br>Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 reads:<br><blockquote>ART. 267. <i>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention.-- </i>Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.<br><ol type="1"><li> If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than three days.<br><br></li><li> If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.<br><br></li><li> If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained, or if threats to kill him shall have been made.<br><br></li><li> If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, except when the accused is any of the parents, female or a public officer.</li></ol>The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.<br><br>When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed. (As amended by RA No. 7659).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>For the accused to be convicted of kidnapping or serious illegal detention, the prosecution is burdened to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime, namely, (1) the offender is a private individual; (2) he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (3) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (4) in the commission of the offense any of the following circumstances is present: (a)  the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than three days; (b) it is committed by simulating public authority; (c) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or (d) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><sup> </sup>If the victim of kidnapping and serious illegal detention is a minor, the duration of his detention is immaterial. Likewise, if the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained for the purpose of extorting ransom, the duration of his detention is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><sup> </sup>The word "female" in paragraph 1(4) of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code refers to the gender of the victim and not of the offender.<br><br>The essence of the crime of kidnapping is the actual deprivation of the victim's liberty under any of the above-mentioned circumstances, coupled with indubitable proof of intent of the accused to effect the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> There must be a purposeful or knowing action by the accused to forcibly restrain the victim because taking coupled with intent completes the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Kidnapping which involves the detention of another is by its nature a continuing crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The victim's lack of consent is also a fundamental element of kidnapping. The involuntariness of the seizure and detention is the very essence of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><sup> </sup>The general rule is that the prosecution is burdened to prove lack of consent on the part of the victim. However, where the victim is a minor especially if she is only five years old, lack of consent is presumed. She is incompetent to assent to seizure and illegal detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><sup> </sup>In this case, Angela was merely five years old when she was kidnapped; thus incapable of giving consent. The consent of such child could place the appellants in no better position than if the act had been done against her will. The appellants cannot rely on Angela's initial willingness to go along with them to the restaurant. As Judge Shepherd stated in <i>State v. Chisenhall:</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></i><br><blockquote>It is clear that the consent of the child, obtained by means of persuasion, is no defense, since the result of such persuasion is just as great an evil as if it had been accomplished by other means.</blockquote>A kidnapper should not be rewarded with an acquittal simply because she is ingenious enough to conceal her true motive from her victim until she is able to transport the latter to another place.<br><br>Although Angela was free to roam around in the "dirty house," to draw and to watch television during the entire period of her detention, and was regularly fed and bathed, the appellants are nevertheless guilty of kidnapping and illegally detaining the five-year-old child. As Judge McGill of the United States Court of Appeals said in <i>United States v. McCabe</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></i><i>,</i>"to accept a child's desire for food, comfort as the type of will or consent contemplated in the context of kidnapping would render the concept meaningless."<br><br>In <i>People v. Baldogo,</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></i><i><sup> </sup></i>this Court held that illegal serious detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code as amended, includes not only the imprisonment of a person but also the deprivation of her liberty in whatever form and for whatever length of time. It includes a situation where the victim cannot go out of the place of confinement or detention or is restricted or impeded in his liberty to move.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><sup> </sup>In this case, the door to the office of appellant Bisda was locked while Angela was detained therein. Even if she wanted to escape and go home, Angela, at her age, could not do so all by herself. During the period of her confinement, Angela was under the control of the appellants. The helpless child was waiting and hoping that she would be brought home, or that her parents would come and fetch her.<br><br>The prosecution adduced proof beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants conspired to kidnap and illegally detain Angela. The appellants' testimonies even buttressed the testimonies of both the victim and the other witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br>Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code provides that there is conspiracy when two or more persons agree to commit a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><sup> </sup>In <i>People v.

There was nary a whimper of protest or objection on the part of the appellants to Angela's competence as a witness and the prosecution's failure to propound questions to determine whether Angela understood her obligation and responsibility of telling the truth respecting the matter of her testimony before the court. The appellants did not even bother requesting the trial court for leave to conduct a <i>voir dire </i>examination of Angela. After the prosecution terminated its direct examination, the appellants thereafter cross-examined Angela extensively and intensively on the matter of her testimony on direct examination. It was only in this Court that the appellants raised the matter for the first time, that there was failure on the part of the prosecution to examine Angela on the nature of her oath, and to ascertain whether she had the capacity to distinguish right from wrong.

Angela was barely six years old when she testified. Considering her tender years, innocent and guileless, it is incredible that Angela would testify falsely that the appellants took her from the school through threats and detained her in the "dirty house" for five days. In <i>People v.

At five years old, she could not be expected to act and react to her kidnapping and detention like an adult should. She did not shout and seek help from the school security guards because the appellants told Angela that her parents were waiting for her. Appellant Basilan was the niece of Angela's <i>yaya. </i>She then believed that nothing was amiss.

William Soriano, the victim's father, failed to prove that the appellants or any of them called through the telephone demanding ransom. The collective testimonies of police operatives Tito Tuanggang, Ricardo Dandan and George Torrente were hearsay evidence; hence, barren of probative weight. The trial court likewise failed to take into account the voluntary surrender of appellant Basilan.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General, for its part, posits the view that the prosecution mustered the requisite quantum of evidence to prove that the appellants and no other demanded ransom from the parents of the victim.<br><br>The appellants' contention does not hold water. Admittedly, the prosecution failed to adduce direct evidence that the appellants demanded ransom for the release of the victim. However, the prosecution adduced circumstantial evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants, or at least one of them, demanded ransom from the Soriano spouses for the release of their daughter.<br><br>To warrant the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention for ransom, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt: (a) intent on the part of the accused to deprive the victim of his liberty; (b) actual deprivation of the victim of his liberty; and (c) motive of the accused, which is ransom for the victim or other person for the release of the victim.
