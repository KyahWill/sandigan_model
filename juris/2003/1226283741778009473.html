				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><blockquote> ....&nbsp; It is desirable that criminals should be detected, and to that end that all available evidence should be used.&nbsp; It also is desirable that the government should not itself foster and pay for other crimes, when they are the means by which the evidence is to be obtained.&nbsp; If it pays its officers for having got evidence by crime, I do not see why it may not as well pay them for getting it in the same way, and I can attach no importance to protestations of disapproval if it knowingly accepts and pays and announces that it will pay for the fruits.&nbsp; We have to choose, and for my part I think it a less evil that some criminals should escape than that the government should play an ignoble part.<br></blockquote>So wrote Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in <i>Olmstead v.

The following instances are not deemed "unreasonable" even in the absence of a warrant:<br><blockquote><ol><li><i>Warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest</i>. (Sec. 12, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court and prevailing jurisprudence);<br><br></li><li><i>&nbsp;Search of evidence in "plain view."</i> The elements are: (a) a prior valid intrusion based on the valid warrantless arrest in which the police are legally present in the <i>pursuit</i> of their official duties; (b) the evidence was inadvertently discovered by the police who have the right to be where they are; (c) the evidence must be immediately apparent; (d) "plain view" justified mere seizure of evidence without further search;<br><br></li><li><i>Search of a moving vehicle. </i>Highly regulated by the government, the vehicle's inherent mobility reduces expectation of privacy especially when its transit in public thoroughfares furnishes a highly reasonable suspicion amounting to probable cause that the occupant committed a criminal activity;<br><br></li><li><i>Consented warrantless search</i>;<br><br></li><li><i>Customs search</i>;<br><br></li><li><i>Stop and Frisk; and</i><br><br></li><li><i>Exigent and emergency circumstances</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The RTC justified the warrantless search of appellants' belongings under the first exception, as a search incident to a lawful arrest.&nbsp; It cited as authorities this Court's rulings in <i>People v. Claudio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> <i>People v. Tangliben</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><i> People v. Montilla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and <i>People v. Valdez</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), in arguing for the affirmance of the appealed decision, invokes the cases of <i>People v. Maspil, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> <i>People v. Malmstedt</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and <i>People v. Bagista</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>A search incidental to a lawful arrest is sanctioned by the Rules of Court.&nbsp; Prior to its revision in 2000, Section 12,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Rule 126 of said Rules read as follows:<br><blockquote> SEC. 12. <i> Search incident to lawful arrest. </i>– A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the commission of an offense, without a search warrant.<br><br>Section 5 (a), Rule 113 of the Rules, in turn, allows warrantless arrests:<br><br>SEC. 5.&nbsp; <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful.</i> – A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br>(a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;<br><br>....<br></blockquote>It is significant to note that the search in question preceded the arrest.&nbsp; Recent jurisprudence holds that the arrest must precede the search; the process cannot be reversed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Nevertheless, a search substantially contemporaneous with an arrest can precede the arrest if the police have probable cause to make the arrest at the outset of the search.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The question, therefore, is whether the police in this case had probable cause to arrest appellants.&nbsp; Probable cause has been defined as:<br><blockquote> an actual belief or reasonable grounds of suspicion.&nbsp; The grounds of suspicion are reasonable when, in the absence of actual belief of the arresting officers, the suspicion that the person to be arrested is probably guilty of committing the offense, is based on actual facts, <i>i.e.</i>, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to create the probable cause of guilt of the person to be arrested.&nbsp; A reasonable suspicion therefore must be founded on probable cause, coupled with good faith of the peace officers making the arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote>The long-standing rule in this jurisdiction, applied with a great degree of consistency, is that "reliable information" alone is not sufficient to justify a warrantless arrest under Section 5 (a), Rule 113.&nbsp; The rule requires, in addition, that the accused perform some overt act that would indicate that he "has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense."<br><br>In the leading case of <i>People v. Burgos</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> this Court held that "the officer arresting a person who has just committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense must have <b>personal knowledge </b>of that fact. The offense must also be committed in his presence or within his view."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In <i>Burgos</i>, the authorities obtained information that the accused had forcibly recruited one Cesar Masamlok as member of the New People's Army, threatening the latter with a firearm. Upon finding the accused, the arresting team searched his house and discovered a gun as well as purportedly subversive documents.&nbsp; This Court, in declaring then Section 6 (a), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court inapplicable, ruled that:<br><blockquote> There is no such personal knowledge in this case.&nbsp; Whatever knowledge was possessed by the arresting officers, it came in its entirety from the information furnished by Cesar Masamlok.&nbsp; The location of the firearm was given by the appellant's wife.<br><br>At the time of the appellant's arrest, he was not in actual possession of any firearm or subversive document.&nbsp; Neither was he committing any act which could be described as subversive.&nbsp; He was, in fact, plowing his field at the time of the arrest.<br><br>The right of a person to be secure against any unreasonable seizure of his body and any deprivation of his liberty is a most basic and fundamental one.&nbsp; The statute or rule which allows exceptions to the requirement of warrants of arrest is strictly construed.&nbsp; Any exception must clearly fall within the situations when securing a warrant would be absurd or is manifestly unnecessary as provided by the Rule.&nbsp; We cannot liberally construe the rule on arrests without warrant or extend its application beyond the cases specifically provided by law.&nbsp; To do so would infringe upon personal liberty and set back a basic right so often violated and so deserving of full protection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote>Consequently, the items seized were held inadmissible, having been obtained in violation of the accused's constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br>In <i>People v. Aminnudin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court likewise held the warrantless arrest and subsequent search of appellant therein illegal, given the following circumstances:<br><blockquote> ... the accused-appellant was not, at the moment of his arrest, committing a crime nor was it shown that he was about to do so or that he had just done so.&nbsp; What he was doing was descending the gangplank of the M/V Wilcon 9 and there was no outward indication that he called for his arrest. To all appearances, he was like any of the other passengers innocently disembarking from the vessel.&nbsp; It was only when the informer pointed to him as the carrier of the marijuana that he suddenly became suspect and so subject to apprehension.&nbsp; It was the furtive finger that triggered his arrest.&nbsp; The identification by the informer was the probable cause as determined by the officers (and not a judge) that authorized them to pounce upon Aminnudin and immediately arrest him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></blockquote>Thus, notwithstanding tips from confidential informants and regardless of the fact that the search yielded contraband, the mere act of looking from side to side while holding one's abdomen,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> or of standing on a corner with one's eyes moving very fast, looking at every person who came near,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> does not justify a warrantless arrest under said Section 5 (a).&nbsp; Neither does putting something in one's pocket,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> handing over one's baggage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> riding a motorcycle,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> nor does holding a bag on board a <i>trisikad</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>sanction State intrusion.&nbsp; The same rule applies to crossing the street<i> per se</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Personal knowledge was also required in the case of <i>People v. Doria</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Recently, in <i>People v. Binad Sy Chua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> this Court declared invalid the arrest of the accused, who was walking towards a hotel clutching a sealed Zest-O juice box. For the exception in Section 5 (a), Rule 113 to apply, this Court ruled, two elements must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.&nbsp; Reliable information alone is insufficient.<br><br>In the following cases, the search was held to be incidental to a lawful arrest because of "suspicious" circumstances: <i>People v. Tangliben</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (accused was "acting suspiciously"), <i>People v. Malmstedt</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (a bulge on the accused's waist), and <i>People v. de Guzman</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (likewise a bulge on the waist of the accused, who was wearing tight-fitting clothes).<br><br>There is, however, another set of jurisprudence that deems "reliable information" sufficient to justify a search incident to a warrantless arrest under Section 5 (a), Rule 113, thus deviating from <i>Burgos</i>.&nbsp; To this class of cases belong <i>People v. Maspil, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> <i>People v. Bagista</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> <i>People v. Balingan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> <i>People v. Lising</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> <i>People v. Montilla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> <i>People v. Valdez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> and <i>People v. Gonzales</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> In these cases, the arresting authorities were acting on information regarding an offense but there were no overt acts or suspicious circumstances that would indicate that the accused has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit the same. Significantly, these cases, except the last two, come under some other exception to the rule against warrantless searches.&nbsp; Thus, <i>Maspil, Jr.</i> involved a checkpoint search, <i>Balingan</i> was a search of a moving vehicle, <i>Bagista</i> was both, and <i>Lising</i> and <i>Montilla</i> were consented searches.<br><br>Nevertheless, the great majority of cases conforms to the rule in <i>Burgos</i>, which, in turn, more faithfully adheres to the letter of Section 5(a), Rule 113.&nbsp; Note the phrase "in his presence" therein, connoting personal knowledge on the part of the arresting officer.&nbsp; The right of the accused to be secure against any unreasonable searches on and seizure of his own body and any deprivation of his liberty being a most basic and fundamental one, the statute or rule that allows exception to the requirement of a warrant of arrest is strictly construed.&nbsp; Its application cannot be extended beyond the cases specifically provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>The cases invoked by the RTC and the OSG are, therefore, gravely misplaced.&nbsp; In <i>Claudio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> the accused, who was seated aboard a bus in front of the arresting officer, put her bag behind the latter, thus arousing the latter's suspicion.&nbsp; In <i>Tangliben</i> and <i>Malmstedt</i>, the accused had also acted suspiciously.<br><br>As noted earlier, <i>Maspil, Jr.</i>, <i>Bagista</i> and <i>Montilla </i>were justified by other exceptions to the rule against warrantless searches.&nbsp; <i>Montilla</i>, moreover, was not without its critics.&nbsp; There, majority of the Court held:<br><blockquote> Appellant insists that the mere fact of seeing a person carrying a traveling bag and a carton box should not elicit the slightest suspicion of the commission of any crime since that is normal. But precisely, it is in the ordinary nature of things that drugs being illegally transported are necessarily hidden in containers and concealed from view.&nbsp; Thus, the officers could reasonably assume, and not merely on a hollow suspicion since the informant was by their side and had so informed them, that the drugs were in appellant's luggage.&nbsp; It would obviously have been irresponsible, if now downright absurd under the circumstances, to require the constable to adopt a "wait and see" attitude at the risk of eventually losing the quarry.<br><br>Here, there were sufficient facts antecedent to the search and seizure that, at the point prior to the search were already constitutive of probable cause, and which by themselves could properly create in the minds of the officers a well-grounded and reasonable belief that appellant was in the act of violating the law.&nbsp; The search yielded affirmance both of that probable cause and the actuality that appellant was then actually committing a crime by illegally transporting prohibited drugs.&nbsp; With these attendant facts, it is ineluctable that appellant was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, hence his arrest and the search of his belongings without the requisite warrant were both justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup></blockquote>While concurring with the majority, Mr. Justice Vitug reserved his vote on the discussion on the warrantless search being incidental to a lawful arrest.&nbsp; Mr. Justice Panganiban, joined by Messrs. Justices Melo and Puno, filed a Separate Opinion.<br><br>Although likewise concurring in the majority's ruling that appellant consented to the inspection of his baggage, Justice Panganiban disagreed with the conclusion that the warrantless search was incidental to a lawful arrest.&nbsp; He argued that jurisprudence required personal knowledge on the part of the officers making the <i>in flagrante delicto</i> arrest.&nbsp; In <i>Montilla</i>, the appellant "did not exhibit any overt act or strange conduct that would reasonably arouse in their minds suspicion that he was embarking on some felonious enterprise."<br><blockquote> Law and jurisprudence in fact require stricter grounds for valid arrests and searches without warrant than for the issuance of warrants therefore. In the former, the arresting person must have actually witnessed the crime being committed or attempted by the person sought to be arrested; or he must have personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested perpetrated the crime that had just occurred. In the latter case, the judge simply determines personally from testimonies of witnesses that there exists reasonable grounds to believe that a crime was committed by the accused.<br><br>....<br><br>To say that "reliable tips" constitute probable cause for a warrantless arrest or search is in my opinion, a dangerous precedent and places in great jeopardy the doctrines laid down in many decisions made by this Court, in its effort to zealously guard and protect the sacred constitutional right against unreasonable arrests, searches and seizures.&nbsp; Everyone would be practically at the mercy of so-called informants, reminiscent of the makapilis during the Japanese occupation. Any one whom they point out to a police officer as a possible violator of the law could then be subject to search and possible arrest.&nbsp; This is placing limitless power upon informants who will no longer be required to affirm under oath their accusations, for they can always delay their giving of tips in order to justify warrantless arrests and searches. Even law enforcers can use this as an oppressive tool to conduct searches without warrants, for they can always claim that they received raw intelligence information only on the day or afternoon before. This would clearly be a circumvention of the legal requisites for validly effecting an arrest or conducting a search and seizure. Indeed the majority's ruling would open loopholes that would allow unreasonable arrests, searches and seizures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></blockquote><i>Montilla</i> would shortly find mention in Justice Panganiban's concurring opinion in <i>People v. Doria</i>, <i>supra</i>, where this Court ruled:<br><blockquote> Accused-Appellant Gaddao was arrested <i>solely</i> on the basis of the alleged identification made by her co-accused.&nbsp; PO3 Manlangit, however, declared in his direct examination that appellant Doria named his co-accused in response to his (PO3 Manlangit's) query as to where the marked <i>money</i> was. Appellant Doria did not point to appellant Gaddao as his associate in the drug business, but as the person with whom he left the marked bills. This identification does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that appellant Gaddao conspired with her co-accused in pushing drugs.

Save for accused-appellant Doria's word, the Narcom agents had no showing that the person who affected the warantless arrest had, in his own right, knowledge of facts implicating the person arrested to the perpetration of a criminal offense, the arrest is legally objectionable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> [Italics in the original.]<br></blockquote>Expressing his accord with Mr. Justice Puno's <i>ponencia</i>, Justice Panganiban said that <i>Doria </i>"rightfully brings the Court back to well-settled doctrines on warrantless arrests and searches, which have seemingly been modified through an <i>obiter</i> in <i>People v.

They were brought to the police station where the foregoing incident was recorded in the police blotter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The seized packages of suspected marijuana, weighing 820 grams and 3.2 kilograms, were referred to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Region XI, Davao City, for examination.&nbsp; The forensic result revealed that the dried leaves were indeed marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>For his defense, appellant NOEL TUDTUD testified that in the morning of August 1, 1999, he left for Kabacan, North Cotabato to sell ten pieces of Levis<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>maong</i> pants to students at the University of Southern Mindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He left for Davao City in the afternoon, taking the Weena bus crossing Bayabas and arrived at Toril at about 8:30 p.m., where he alighted before going to his residence at Sapa, Crossing Bayabas, Toril, Davao City.&nbsp; After the bus left, somebody whom he later identified as PO1 Desierto aimed a gun at him and ordered him to open a box, which yielded marijuana leaves.&nbsp; He denied carrying said carton box or knowing its contents but despite his pleas he was handcuffed and brought to the Toril Police Station along with somebody whom he had never met before, herein co-appellant Dindo Bolong,<br><br>In his own testimony, co-appellant DINDO BOLONG likewise denied knowing Noel Tudtud.&nbsp; He too, disclaimed any knowledge of a carton box containing the subject marijuana.&nbsp; He denied having carried said carton box together with his co-appellants.&nbsp; He narrated that on August 1, 1999, he went to Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, to do an errand for his cousin who was about to get married. In the afternoon of that day, he boarded a Weena bus going back to Calinan, Davao City, but decided to drop by at Toril, Davao City, to meet a relative.&nbsp; When he alighted at the crossing of Bayabas and Toril in Davao City, at about 8:30 p.m., he and another man, herein appellant Tudtud, were apprehended by a man who handcuffed them.&nbsp; They were at once brought together to the Toril Police Station.<br><br>In its decision dated March 8, 2000, the trial court disbelieved the version of the defense and gave credence to the testimony of the apprehending officers, as corroborated by the Philippine National Police forensic chemist.&nbsp; The trial court found appellants guilty, as follows:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of prosecution more than sufficient to prove the guilt of both accused of the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt, pursuant to the provision of Sec. 8, Art. 11 of the Republic Act 6575, as amended by Republic Act 7659, Sec. 20 Art. 4, without any aggravating nor mitigating circumstances attendant in the commission of the offense charged, both above-named accused, Noel Tudtud y Paypa and Dindo Bolong y Naret, are sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of reclusion perpetua, together with all accessory penalty as provided for by law and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 in favor of the government.<br><br>The confiscated subject marijuana dried leaves, placed in a carton box with name "King Flakes" marked Exh. "A" and "B" for the prosecution, are ordered confiscated in favor of the government, and are turn-over (sic) to the Office of the Narcotics Command, Davao City, for its immediate destruction through burning, as the circumstances, will warrant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal before us.&nbsp; Appellant Noel Tudtud assigned in his Brief several errors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On July 19, 2001, appellant Dindo Bolong filed a manifestation, adopting appellant Tuftud's brief as his own.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In our view, the resolution of this appeal hinges on the following issues: (1) whether the warrantless arrest, search and seizure effected by the police officer are unlawful; (2) whether the prosecution's evidence suffices to sustain a finding of guilt with moral certainty; and (3) whether the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and the fine of P500,000 imposed on each appellant are proper.<br><br>On the <i>first issue</i>, appellants content that the warrantless arrest of appellants and the search and seizure of the marijuana leaves were irregular, hence, unlawful. They claim that the marijuana allegedly seized from them was a product of an illegal search, hence, inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), however, argues that the findings and conclusions of the trial court should be sustained.&nbsp; According to the OSG, the law permits the warrantless search and seizure of the marijuana as an incident to a lawful arrest.&nbsp; I am squarely in agreement with the OSG's submission.<br><br>The validity of the warrantless arrest and the search made by the police upon the persons of appellants, as well as the seizure of the marijuana leaves, as herein presented, is no longer a matter of first impression.&nbsp; Jurisprudence is replete with cases on this score.<br><br>Section 2, Article III of the Constitution, ordains that a search and seizure must be carried out through or on the strength of a judicial warrant, absent which such search and seizure becomes "unreasonable"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and that evidence secured on the occasion of such an unreasonable search and seizure shall be inadmissible in evidence for any purpose in any proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> But this exclusionary rule is not, however, an absolute and rigid proscription.&nbsp; Section 5(a), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> provides one such exception where a peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person when, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense.&nbsp; In the case at hand, appellants were caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>, since they were carrying marijuana at the time of their arrest. A warrantless arrest, under this circumstance, is legitimate.&nbsp; It also necessarily cloaks the arresting police officer with authority to search and seize from the offender contraband or prohibited material and whatever may be used as proof of the offense being committed.<br><br>However, the instances of permissible arrests set out in Section 5(a) of Rule 113, do not dispense with the requisite probable cause before a warrantless search and seizure can be lawfully conducted.&nbsp; In these cases, probable cause must only be based on reasonable ground of suspicion or belief that a crime has been committed or is about to be committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The required probable cause that will justify a warrantless search and seizure is not determined by a fixed formula but is resolved according to the facts of each case.<br><br>In this case, I note that the arresting officers personally verified the information tipped to them by their civilian informant concerning appellant Tudtud's drug trafficking activities.&nbsp; After receiving this information from Solier, PO1 Desierto and other members of the Intelligence Section of Toril Precinct, conducted surveillance operations on appellants for five (5) days and confirmed the tip.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Having verified Solier's data, the police officers had personal knowledge of the probable cause to believe the subsequent tip-off in the morning of August 1, 1999 that on that day, Tudtud was on another trip to Cotabato to replenish his stocks of marijuana and was expected to arrive in the afternoon of the same day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Further, the informant described in detail the personal circumstances of appellant Tudtud, <i>i.e.</i> that he was short, burly, and usually wore a baseball cap.&nbsp; PO1 Desierto and his team already had leases as to the identity of the person they were looking for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It was indubitable, therefore, that the police team of PO1 Desierto had probable cause to search appellant Tudtud's belongings since he fitted the description given by the civilian asset.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The warrantless search and seizure is further justified by lack of material time to apply for a search warrant.&nbsp; Faced with such on-the-spot information that Tudtud would arrive that same day with the prohibited drugs, the law enforcers had to respond quickly.&nbsp; As often said, it is necessary to adopt a realistic appreciation of the physical and tactical problems of the police, instead of critically viewing them from the placid and clinical environment of judicial chambers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> if courts of justice wish to be of understanding assistance to law enforcement agencies in the fight against crime.<br><br>Moreover, appellants consented to the search in this case.&nbsp; This, to me, is established not merely from the words but the actions taken hereon. When the officers approached appellants, they formally introduced themselves as policemen.&nbsp; They inquired from appellants about the contents of their luggage, and requested appellant Tudtud to open the box.&nbsp; Although trembling, appellant Tuftuf agreed to the request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Neither did appellant Bolong resist the search.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Cuizon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> we held that illegal drugs discovered as a result of consented search is admissible in evidence.&nbsp; And, in <i>People v. Montilla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> when an individual voluntarily submits to a search or consents to have the same conducted upon his person or premises, he is precluded from later complaining thereof.<br><br>Circumstances considered, I believe that there was a valid warrantless search by the police officer. Any evidence obtained during the course of said search is admissible in evidence against appellants.<br><br>On the <i>second issue</i>, I concur in the trial court's conclusion that the prosecution has proved appellant's guilt for violation of Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Dangerous Drugs Act beyond reasonable doubt, for the following reasons:<br><br>The elements of illegal possession of marijuana are: (a) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified to be a prohibited drug; (b) such possession is not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The identity of either appellant as a possessor of the seized marijuana leaves is not at issue.&nbsp; Both were caught <i>in flagrante delicto </i>in a standard police operation.&nbsp; The substance found in appellants' possession was identified after laboratory analysis by Philippine National Police forensic chemist Noemi Austero to be marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Appellants' lack of authority to possess these items was also established.<br><br>Appellants' awareness of the prohibited drug's character is also irrefutable.&nbsp; When stopped by the policemen, appellant Tudtud was holding the plastic bag in one hand and a carton box in his other hand, with appellant Bolong was helping him in carrying said box.&nbsp; Irrefutably, appellants' <i>animus possidendi</i> existed together with the possession or control of said articles.&nbsp; Recently, in <i>People v. Tee</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we held that possession of a prohibited drug <i>per se</i> constitutes <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i> sufficient to convict an accused absent a satisfactory explanation of such possession.&nbsp; In effect, the <i>onus probandi</i> must be shifted to the accused to explain the absence of knowledge or consciousness of the element of possession of the contraband, <i>i.e. </i>his <i>animus possidendi</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Appellants, in this case, have failed to discharge this exculpatory burden.<br><br>The conspiracy to commit the offense between appellants Noel Tudtud and Dindo Bolong clearly appears from the records.&nbsp; They were apprehended at the same time.&nbsp; They alighted together from the bus at the highway corner of Toril, Davao City. Appellant Bolong was helping his co-appellant Tudtud carry the "King Flakes" carton box, which contained what turned out to be a large quantity of dried marijuana leaves covered by dried fish and concealed in plastic and newspaper wrapper.&nbsp; These factors convince me that indeed the two appellants had conspired together and helped each other in the commission of the offense.<br><br>As the trial court explained, the frame-up angle in this case that appellants wish to peddle in their defense does not inspire belief.&nbsp; Like alibi, the defense of frame-up is viewed with disfavor, because it is easily concocted.&nbsp; It is a common and standard line of defense in cases arising from violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Appellant Tudtud's alibi that he came from Kabacan, North Cotabato, where he sold Levis jeans, is uncorroborated.&nbsp; In his memorandum, he referred to Exh. "F," claiming that the apprehending officers had confiscated the six pants then in his possession,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> although Exh. "F" refers to the entry in the police blotter on the arrest of both appellants, with no mention of a plastic bag containing 6 Levis jeans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In the same vein, the defense of appellant Dindo Bolong, that he took the bus from Hagonoy, Davao del Sur, after delivering invitations for his cousin's wedding, remains a bare allegation that is not substantiated.&nbsp; The version of the incident by the police officers, coming as it did from law enforcers presumed to have regularly performed their duty in the absence of proof to the contrary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and accepted as credible by the trial court, has not been discredited at all by appellants who claimed a frame-up without sufficient bases.<br><br>Appellants next assail the credibility of the civilian informant, witness Bobong Solier, on the ground that various informations and complaints had been filed against him in the City Court and Regional Trial Court off Davao City.&nbsp; But it should be stressed that witness Solier's testimony is not essential for the conviction of the appellants.&nbsp; Testimony of the police informant in an illegal drug case is merely cumulative and corroborative of the apprehending officers' eyewitness testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Moreover, Solier's tip-off was not the sole basis for the police operation in this case as there was prior surveillance conducted by the police.&nbsp; As it stands, Solier's testimony merely buttressed the case for the prosecution.<br><br>The investigative including laboratory procedures adopted in this regard by Chief Inspector Noemi Austero are being criticized by appellants.&nbsp; They lament that the Duquenois Levine Test conducted by Austero at the PNP Crime Laboratory on the confiscated leaves was inconclusive in regard to determining whether the confiscated items were indeed marijuana, absent any confirmatory or other tests.&nbsp; However, nothing on record effectively negates the finding of the trial court that the test was regularly performed.&nbsp; The trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal, unless there appears on record some facts of weight and substance that have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied by the trial court.<br><br>The trial court, in my view, did not err in ruling that the prosecution has established the guilt of appellants beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Appellants are guilty of illegal possession of a prohibited drug under Section 8 of Republic Act 6425, which provides:<br><blockquote> SEC. 8. <i>Possession or Use of Prohibited Drugs</i>. - The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death and a fine raging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos shall be imposed upon any person who unless authorized by law, shall possess or use any prohibited drug subject to the provisions of Section 20 hereof.&nbsp; (As amended by Republic Act 7659).<br></blockquote>In sentencing both appellants to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and in imposing a fine of P500,000 upon each of them, the trial court was not in error but only enforcing law and policy on prohibited and dangerous drugs.&nbsp; Under R.A. No. 6425 as amended by R.A. No. 7659, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000) to ten million pesos (10,000,000) shall be imposed if the quantity of marijuana involved in a conviction for possession of marijuana or Indian hemp is 750 grams or more.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Chemistry Report submitted by forensic chemist Noemi Austero states that the subject prohibited drugs were: "(a) Dried suspected Marijuana fruiting tops weighing 3,200 grams contained in a "King Flakes" box, and (b) Dried suspected Marijuana leaves weighing 890.0 grams contained in pink and white plastic bag."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The quantity of the confiscated marijuana as proved by the prosecution weighs more than 4 kilos, much in excess of 750 grams cited by the law as baseline for the penalty involved.&nbsp; In the absence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the lower penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> should be properly imposed, in view of Art. 63 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>To conclude, I am of the considered view that the judgment of the Regional Trial Court convicting the appellants, as well as the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> imposed on them, should be affirmed.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 16-34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Sometimes spelled as "Bulong" in other parts of the records.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Rollo, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, 15 November 1999, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 8, 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> "Villalonja" and "Villalonghan" in other parts of the records.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, 15 November 1999, pp. 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, 16 November 1999, pp. 8-9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> TSN, 15 November 1999, p. 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Supra</i>, note 12; TSN, 16 November 1999, p. 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> TSN, 15 November 1999, pp. 11-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> TSN, 16 November 1999, p. 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> TSN, 15 November 1999, p. 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TSN, 12 November 1999, pp. 5-7; Records, p. 51, Exh.
