The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed the crime of rape and is sentenced to DEATH.<br><br>The accused is further ordered to indemnify the complainant Elma Luna Bacelonia the amount of P75,000.00 plus P50,000.00 for moral damages.<br><br>The accused who is presently detained at the Provincial Jail at Magbay, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, is ordered immediately transferred to the New Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila.<br><br>Costs against said accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u><i>The Charge</i></u></b><br></div><br>Appellant was charged with the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 and Republic Act No. 8353 for raping Elma Luna Bacelonia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> ("Elma Luna"). The Information reads as follows:<br><blockquote> That on or about the 29th day of October 1998, at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening in Barangay San Francisco, Municipality of Sablayan, Province of Occidental Mindoro, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused, with lewd design, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have carnal knowledge of Elma Luna Ba(c)elonia, who is a minor, against her will and consent.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>Arraignment and Plea</i></b></u><br></div><br>When arraigned on 8 January 1999, appellant, with the assistance of counsel, entered a plea of not guilty. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thus, trial ensued.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u><i>The Trial</i></u></b><br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br></div><br>The prosecution presented four witnesses: (1) Elma Luna's mother, Marcelina dela Cruz Bacelonia; (2) Dr. Wilfred Kenept; (3) Elma Luna herself; and (4) Elma Luna's brother, Elvimar Bacelonia.<br><br>In the People's Brief, the Solicitor General summarized the prosecution's version of the incident as follows:<br><blockquote> The offended party was born on May 14, 1989 to Elpidio Bacelonia and Marcelina Bacelonia (Exhibit D, p. 2, TSN, July 7, 1999). After the death of Elpidio, Marcelina cohabited with appellant without the benefit of marriage (pp. 2, 13, TSN, July 7, 1999; p. 4, TSN, March 15, 1999). Appellant, complainant and her children by her former husband, including the offended party, lived in Barangay San Francisco, Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro.<br><br>Around 9:00 o'clock in the evening of October 29, 1998, appellant invited the offended party and her brother Elvimar to fish at a pond about one hundred (100) meters away from their house. Appellant told Elvimar to stay at the road, while he brought the offended party to a place where straws were stacked (dayamihan). He undressed and laid her down and inserted his penis in her vagina. The offended party shouted in pain. Her cries of pain were heard by Elvimar, who remained nearby. After consummating his lust, appellant threatened the offended party that he would kill her if she would tell her mother about the incident (pp. 4-7, TSN, July 7, 1999).<br><br>When the offended party went home, Elvimar informed complainant (their mother, Marcelina) that he heard her sister cry. Complainant asked the offended party what happened. Instead of answering, the offended party just wept. Complainant noticed that her daughter had a "hickee" on her neck. Breaking her silence, the offended party confirmed that she was sexually abused by appellant (pp. 5-7, TSN, March 15, 1999).<br><br>Dr. Wilfred D. Kenept, the Municipal Health Officer of Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro, examined the offended party and found out:<br><blockquote> x x x<br><br>GENITALIA - normal looking external genitalia. Laceration noted in the Lavia<i> </i>Majora 9 o'clock position, laceration noted in the Labia Minora 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock position.<br><br>(Exhibit B, p. 81, Record)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br></div><br>The defense presented three witnesses: (1) appellant himself; (2) Dr. Nuela Manzanida; and (3) Ricardo Aguirre.<br><br>The Public Attorney summarized the defense's version as culled from the testimonies of its witnesses as follows:<br><blockquote> <b>DIONISIO ROTE </b>averred that Elma Luna Bacelonia is his stepdaughter. He denied that he invited Elvimar and Elma Luna to go fishing and that he intentionally left Elvimar by the road before they went fishing; and that he brought Elma Luna to a "dayamihan" and sexually abused her at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening on October 29, 1998. At that time, he was in the place of a certain Dodong Aguirre in Sitio Cabacungan which is about 50 meters away from their house. He, together with Giovanni Flores and Dodong Aguirre had a drinking spree in the said place from 6:00 o'clock in the evening up to 12:00 midnight. After consuming six (6) bottles of gin, he, together with Giovanni Flores went home. When he arrived home, the children (Netnet and Jess) were already sleeping but his common-law wife was still awake. He likewise denied that on October 30, 1998, at around 6:30 o'clock in the morning the complainant (Elma Luna) had reported to her mother that he sexually abused her at the "dayamihan." Apparently, prior to the filing of the criminal complaint against him, he had a quarrel with his common-law wife when he refused to lend money to her eldest daughter (Alma) who was then planning to build a house. In fact, the common-law wife even told him, "bakit paabutin ng umaga, hiwalay kung hiwalay." He replied that if she does not leave the house the next morning, he would be the one to leave. So, she left the house the next morning and went to Sitio Kastila and she never returned. He further denied that he invited Elvimar and Elma Luna to go fishing on October 29, 1998, at around 9:00 o'clock p.m. and that Elvimar heard the cry of Elma Luna when the latter was allegedly sexually molested by him. He was arrested on October 30, 1998. (TSN, November 4, 1999, pp. 2-12)<br><br><b>DR. NUELA C. MANZANIDA</b>, Municipal Health Officer of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, testified that the complainant's hymen could still be intact because Dr. Kenept did not put anything about it in his findings. Based on the Medico Legal Certificate, the lacerations were found only in the labia minora and labia majora which could be caused by other objects aside from the insertion of a human penis. In fact, said lacerations could also be caused by accident. (TSN, February 16, 2000, pp. 2-6)<br><br><b>RICARDO AGUIRRE </b>testified that on October 29, 1998, at around 6:00 o'clock in the evening, while he was sitted (sic) in front of their house, Dionisio Rote and Diovanie (sic) Flores approached him because they were able to buy fish which they later cooked as "pulutan". They had a drinking spree which lasted up to 12:00 o'clock midnight. They were able to consume 3 bottles of gin. During the duration of their drinking spree, there was no occasion that accused Dionisio Rote left the place, In fact, Dionisio went home at around 12:00 o'clock midnight. He knew the complainant (Elma Luna) by face and not by name. At around 7:00 o'clock the following day, he saw the complainant and her mother waiting for a bus going to Sitio Castila, Sablayan. While waiting for the bus, the complainant and her brother alternately rode a bicycle and roamed around their place. The complainant and her mother were able to board the bus at around 8:00 o'clock in the morning. He learned that the accused was charged by his own stepdaughter only on the afternoon of October 30, 1998. (TSN, March 21, 2000, pp. 2-8)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b><i>The Trial Court's Judgment</i></b></u><br></div><br>The trial court did not give credence to appellant's imputation of ill-motive on the part of his common-law wife, Marcelina, in bringing the charges against him. The trial court also disbelieved appellant's defenses of denial and alibi which cannot hold up against Elma Luna's positive identification of appellant as her rapist. The trial court stated that appellant failed to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. In the evening of 29 October 1998, appellant could have gone fishing, carried out his evil deed and then proceeded to Ricardo Aguirre's house for a drinking spree since these locations were well within a hundred meters from each other. Lastly, the trial court pointed out that the fact that Elma Luna's hymen has remained intact does not preclude the finding of rape since mere entrance of the male organ within the labia of the pudendum still constitutes rape.<br><br>Hence, this automatic review.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u><i>Issues</i></u></b><br></div><br>Appellant raises the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The trial court gravely erred in finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 and Republic Act No. 8353;<br><br></li><li>The trial court gravely erred in imposing the capital punishment of death on the assumption that he is guilty of the crime charged.<br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u><i>The Court's Ruling</i></u></b><br></div><br>By the very nature of the crime of rape, conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely on the credibility of the victim's testimony because usually only the participants can testify as to its occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> To exculpate himself, appellant tries to discredit and assail Elma Luna's credibility. However, he does not point to any particular portion of Elma Luna's testimony or any other prosecution evidence which casts doubt on his guilt or evinces the improbability of the commission of the crime charged. The only conclusion is that Elma Luna's credibility is beyond dispute and her testimony is worthy of full faith and credence. Elma Luna recounted her ordeal in the hands of appellant in a straightforward, candid and firm manner thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">On the evening of October 29, 1998, do you remember having invited (sic) by your stepfather to go with your brother Elvimar to go fishing?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Did you in fact went (sic) fishing on that night?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Together with your brother Elvimar?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">How far was that fishing ground away from your house?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">From here up to the plaza.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">FISCAL SALCEDO:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Estimated to be 100 meters.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">After you arrived at the place where you intended to fish with your stepfather Dionisio Rote what did he do to you?

</tbody></table></blockquote>It is improbable that Elma Luna, then only a 9-year old child and not exposed to the ways of the world, would impute a crime as serious as rape to any man if what she claims is not true. It becomes even more improbable if the man she accuses of rape is the common law husband of her mother, unless the man indeed raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Appellant claims that an argument he had with Elma Luna's mother prompted the latter to file the rape case against him. It is highly unlikely that a mother would expose her own daughter to the embarrassment and humiliation as well as to the trouble, ridicule and scandal arising from a public trial involving rape if such was not the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the medical examination conducted on Elma Luna buttressed her testimony that she was raped. Dr. Wilfred Kenept who examined Elma Luna a day after the incident on 30 October 1998, testified that there were fresh lacerations with swelling in Elma Luna's vagina. Although he stated that the hymen might still be intact since he did not see it because of the lacerations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [10]</sup> the rupture of the hymen is not necessary to consummate rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> As correctly held by the trial court, mere touching by the male's organ of the labia of the pudendum of the female's private part is sufficient to consummate rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellant's twin defenses of denial and alibi, already recognized as inherently weak, appear even more feeble and self-serving in the face of Elma Luna's positive and credible testimony.<br><br>Appellant was prosecuted and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and Republic Act No. 8353,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which reads:<br><blockquote> Article 266-A. <i>Rape; When And How Committed. – </i>Rape is Committed -<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="10%">1)</td> <td width="85%"> By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the circumstances:</td> </tr> </tbody></table><div style="margin-left: 40px;"> xxx<br></div><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="10%">d) </td> <td width="85%">When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above is present.</td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">xxx.<br></div><br>Article 266-B.

The prosecution established Elma Luna's minority by presenting her birth certificate which showed her date of birth as 14 May 1989. Hence, when appellant raped Elma Luna on 29 October 1998, she was only 9 years old. Where the girl is below 12 years old, the only subject of inquiry is whether "carnal knowledge" took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Proof of force, intimidation or consent is unnecessary since none of these is an element of statutory rape. There is a conclusive presumption of absence of free consent when the rape victim is below the age of twelve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the death penalty is not the correct penalty for the rape committed by appellant because the information filed against him failed to state his relationship with Elma Luna. To justify imposing the death penalty, the information must specifically allege the qualifying circumstances of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender, and the prosecution must prove during the trial these attendant circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> While the prosecution did prove that appellant was the common-law spouse of Elma Luna's mother, the information failed to allege such fact.
