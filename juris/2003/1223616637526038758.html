				<BR><STRONG>AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On automatic review is the joint decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, Branch 18, in Criminal Cases Nos. CBU-45672 and CBU-45673 finding Romeo H. Lambid guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of qualified rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death for each count.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In her two separate Complaints dated November 4, 1997 and November 5, 1997, complainant Lyzel S. Lambid, accuses Romeo H. Lambid of raping her, as follows:<br><blockquote>In Criminal Case No. CBU-45672:<br><br>The undersigned complainant, LYZEL S. LAMBID, after having been duly sworn to in accordance with law, hereby accuses ROMEO H. LAMBID of the crime of Rape, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 31<sup>st</sup> day of October, 1997, at about 5:00 A.M., and for sometime subsequent thereto, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation upon undersigned complainant to wit, by forcibly placing himself on top of the victim, and at the same time threat her with death if she would shout, then removed her panty, did then and there have carnal knowledge of the undersigned against her will.<br></blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. CBU-45673:<br><br>The undersigned complainant, LYZEL S. LAMBID, after having been duly sworn to in accordance with law, hereby accuses ROMEO H. LAMBID of the crime of Rape, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 1<sup>st</sup> day of November, 1997, at about 5:00 A.M., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation upon undersigned complainant to wit, by forcibly placing himself on top of the victim, and at the same time threat her with death if she would shout, then removed her panty, did then and there have carnal knowledge of the undersigned against her will.<br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Upon his arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges. The cases were consolidated and tried jointly.<br><br>The prosecution presented three witnesses: Lyzel Lambid, the complainant; Mary Ann Lambid, a sister of Lyzel; and Dr. Aster Khosravibabadi, the physician who conducted a physical examination on the complainant.<br><br>The facts established by the prosecution are as follows:<br><br>On October 31, 1997, 14-year old Lyzel was sleeping in their house located at Inayawan, Cebu City together with her father, herein appellant, and two sisters.  Around 5:00 in the morning, she woke up and noticed her father lying beside her.  Then, her father started removing her panty at the same time warning her not to tell her mother what he was doing.  After her father succeeded in removing her panty, he went on top of her and started inserting his penis into her vagina.  She initially tried to resist the sexual advances of her father by kicking him and by moving her body from left to right and vice versa.  She stopped resisting when her father stared hard at her and threatened to kill her (Lyzel).  Her father succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina. The following day, November 1, 1997, she was again roused from her sleep and noticed her father lying beside her. Repeating what he did the previous day, her father removed her panty.  Thereafter, he successfully inserted his penis into her vagina. Lyzel did nothing out of fear. She did not tell anybody about these two incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>However, her sister, Mary Ann, aged 13, witnessed both incidents. She was awakened around 5:00 in the morning of October 31, 1997 when she heard their father say to her sister Lyzel: "Don't tell this to your mother or else I will kill you."  Their father was then lying beside Lyzel. Afterwards, she saw him stand up and go to urinate.  About 5:00 in the morning of the succeeding day, November 1, 1997, she was sleeping beside her sister Lyzel.  She was awakened while their father was pulling her blanket.  Suspicious of their father's actuation, she kicked him.  After kicking him, she laid near the foot of her sister Lyzel. Their father then covered her with a blanket but she peeped through the blanket.  She saw their father who was only wearing an underwear place himself on top of Lyzel.  Her father covered himself and Lyzel with a blanket, after which Mary Ann saw their father's whole body shake and heard him breathing hard.  She again heard their father warn Lyzel not to relate the incident to their mother, otherwise he will kill her (Lyzel).<br><br>On November 2, 1997, Mary Ann informed three of their neighbors about the incidents she witnessed. Their neighbors brought her to the president of their local association for assistance and on that same day their father was arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Dr. Aster Khosravibabadi conducted a physical examination of Lyzel on November 3, 1997 and found that Lyzel's vagina had "new hymenal lacerations with raw edges at 5 o'clock position."  The doctor asserted that Lyzel might have sustained the lacerations within six days prior to her examination.  The test for the presence of spermatozoa yielded negative results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The defense presented appellant as its lone witness.  On the witness stand, when asked about the truth of her daughter's complaint, appellant simply stated that if he had committed the crimes of rape against his daughter, he asks for forgiveness because during that time he was drunk. He asked the court to impose upon him a lesser penalty considering that his children are still under his care.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The trial court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused Romeo H. Lambid guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, defined and penalized by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code and Republic Act No. 7659 known as the Death Penalty Law and sentences him to suffer two supreme penalties of Death for the two (2) crimes of rape committed against her own daughter Lyzel Lambid, with inherent accessory penalties provided by law; to indemnify the victim the sum of P100,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present automatic review pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>Appellant raises the following Assignment of Errors:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED BASED ON REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><center><br>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN IMPOSING THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO ALLEGE THE AGE AND RELATIONSHIP OF THE VICTIM AND THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>At the outset, it is noted that since the crimes were committed on October 31, 1997 and November 1, 1997, the applicable law is R.A. 8353, otherwise known as "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which took effect on October 22, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Under this law, rape has been reclassified from a private crime or crime against chastity into a crime against persons. Consequently, the prosecution for the crime of rape was removed from the ambit of Chapter Five, Title Eleven of the Revised Penal Code and Section 5, Rule 110 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure which required that in crimes against chastity, the complaint must be filed by the offended party, or her parents, godparents or guardian, as the case may be under the law.  Thus, effective October 22, 1997, R.A. No. 8353, it is required that prosecution for the crime of rape, as in any other public crimes, is commenced in court by the filing of an information by the public prosecutor and no longer by a mere complaint filed by the offended party, parents, godparents or guardian.<br><br>In the present cases, the indictments charging appellant with the crimes of rape were each captioned as a "Complaint" signed by Lyzel herself; but, there is a Certification on the second page of each of the complaints by the investigating prosecutor treating the complaint as an information, to wit:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. CBU-45672:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">CERTIFICATION<br></div><br>I hereby certify that the foregoing information is filed pursuant to Sec. 7, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, the accused not having opted to avail of his right to a preliminary investigation and not having executed a waiver pursuant to Art. 125 of the Revised Penal Code.  <b>I further certify that this information is being filed with the prior authority of the City Prosecutor.</b><br><br>Cebu City, Philippines, November 4, 1997.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(signed)<br>JOSE R. PEDROSA<br>Prosecutor II, Cebu City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></div><div style="text-align: center;">(Emphasis supplied)<br></div><br>In Criminal Case No. CBU-45673:<br><center><br>CERTIFICATION<br></center><br>I hereby certify that the foregoing information is filed pursuant to Sec. 7, Rule 112 of the 1985  Rules on  Criminal  Procedure,  as  amended, the accused having opted to avail of his right to a preliminary investigation and having executed a waiver pursuant to Art. 125 of the Revised Penal Code.  <b>I further certify that this information is being filed with the prior authority of the City Prosecutor.</b><br><br>Cebu City, Philippines, November 5, 1997.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(signed)<br>JOSE R. PEDROSA<br>Prosecutor II, Cebu City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></div></blockquote>The apparent defect in the form of indictment, that is by way of a complaint by the offended party, is merely one of form which does not invalidate the proceedings had in the trial court.  The certification converted the complaints into informations filed by the prosecutor.<br><br>Moreover, under Section 8, Rule 117 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the governing law at the time of the filing of the indictments, for his failure to move to quash the same prior to his arraignment, appellant was deemed to have waived his right to question the complaints filed by Lyzel on the ground that it is defective in form per Section 3(d), Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Coming to the merits of the case, appellant, in support of the first assigned error, attacks the credibility of the complainant.  He harps upon the fact that although Lyzel was sure of the dates when appellant raped her, she failed to recall the days of the week upon which these dates fell. Appellant also points out the apparent inconsistency as to the date Lyzel's mother arrived from Leyte and the date she accompanied Lyzel to report the incident to the police authorities.<br><br>We agree with the contention of the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) that the failure of complainant to correctly pinpoint the day of the week when she was raped and to recall the exact date of her mother's arrival from Leyte are inconsequential matters.  It is a settled rule that discrepancies in details which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime, such as the exact time of the commission of the crime, are not grounds for acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> To be material, discrepancies in the testimony of the victim should refer to significant facts which are determinative of the guilt or innocence of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the present case, the mental lapse on the part of Lyzel in failing to accurately recall the exact days of the week when she was raped and the date of her mother's arrival from Leyte does not detract from her credibility.  It only indicates that her account is spontaneous, neither rehearsed nor contrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> What is important is that she was able to clearly recall how she was raped and testify on this matter in a categorical and straightforward manner.<br><br>Moreover, Lyzel's testimony is strongly corroborated by her sister Mary Ann<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and buttressed by physical evidence. The physician's findings on her physical examination conducted on November 3, 1997 indicated the presence of fresh lacerations on her hymen. Laceration of the hymen, whether fresh or healed, is the best physical evidence of defloration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In the present case, the doctor estimated that the lacerations could have been sustained by Lyzel within six days prior to the date of her examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This estimate is consistent with Lyzel's claim that she was raped on October 31, 1997 and November 1, 1997.<br><br>Under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, rape is committed by a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman through fear, threat or intimidation.<br><br>Appellant would have us to believe that if he had carnal knowledge with her daughter Lyzel, it was done without force and intimidation, citing her testimony that she did nothing while she was supposedly being sexually abused by him.<br><br>We are not convinced in the light of Lyzel's testimony, pertinent portions of which we quote verbatim, as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"

When appellant raped her the following day, her fear of her father and of the previous threat that he would kill her still pervaded causing her to do nothing the second time.  Her harrowing experience the day before in the hands of her father coupled with a threat on her life was sufficient to envelop her with fear and paralyze her into submission even if appellant merely stared at her when he raped her again the following morning.  Lyzel's failure to shout or offer tenacious resistance during the second incident does not demolish her claim that she was raped.  As we have held in <i>People vs. Rodriguez</i>:<br><blockquote>The defense argument that the accused has not employed force upon his daughter in order to have sex with him does not at all persuade.  The force or violence necessary in rape is a relative term that depends not only on the age, size, and strength of the persons involved but also on their relationship to each other.  In a rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the former's parental authority and moral ascendancy over the latter substitutes for violence or intimidation who, expectedly, would just cower in fear and resign to the father's wicked deeds.  It would be plain fallacy to say that the failure to shout or to offer tenacious resistance makes voluntary the victim's submission to the criminal act of the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>and in <i>People vs. Flores</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>Intimidation must be viewed in the light of the perception of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime, not by any hard and fast rule; it is therefore enough that it produced fear - fear that if she did not yield to the bestial demands of her revisher, some evil could happen to her at that moment or even thereafter.<br><br>The fact that complainant bore no physical evidence of any force used against her person is of no moment. The absence of any external sign of injury does not necessarily negate the occurrence of rape, proof of injury not being an essential element of the crime.  What is important is that because of force and intimidation, the victim was made to submit to the will of appellant.  As stated in <i>People vs. Maglente</i>, the test is whether the treat or intimidation produces fear in the mind of a reasonable person - that if one resists or does not yield to the desires of the accused, the threat would be carried out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Besides, no less than Lyzel's younger sister Mary Ann positively testified that she heard her father threaten Lyzel's life on both occasions.  Appellant's threat on the life of his 14-year old child and the fear it instilled in her clearly repudiate his claim that there was no force or intimidation employed against her in both occasions.<br><br>Appellant further questions the credibility of Lyzel in enabling him to rape her in two successive days. He contends that after Lyzel was raped for the first time on October 31, 1997, her logical reaction should have been to immediately seek the help of other people; that despite her opportunity to do so, she did not. We are not persuaded.  It is a settled rule that the workings of the human mind under emotional stress are unpredictable and there is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Verily, under emotional stress, the human mind is not expected to follow a predictable path.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Indeed, Lyzel must have been shocked and utterly confused by the fact that her own father, committed such an act of bestiality against her. More importantly, it is established by competent evidence that appellant threatened to kill Lyzel if she told anybody about the rape.  That alone is sufficient explanation why she did not make known to other people the first time that she was raped by her father.<br><br>Appellant raised no defense whatsoever.  He virtually admitted his guilt. A review of the transcript of stenographic notes taken during his direct and cross examinations shows that he never disowned the acts imputed against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Appellant merely claimed that he was drunk and he asked for forgiveness from Lyzel, if he had really raped her and for compassion from the trial court.  In <i>People vs. Alvero</i>, we held that a plea for forgiveness may be considered as analogous to an attempt to compromise and an offer of compromise by the accused may be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, by asking for forgiveness, appellant has admitted his guilt.<br><br>As to the second assigned error, the OSG agrees with appellant. We sustain the arguments of both appellant and the OSG.  The trial court erred in imposing the death penalty.<br><br>Articles 266-A and 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A.

Section 9, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, requires that both qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in the complaint or information.  Existing jurisprudence instructs that the death penalty may be imposed only if the complaint or information has alleged and the evidence has proven both the minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender by the quantum of proof required for conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In the present case, not only were the minority of the complainant and her relationship with appellant not alleged in the two complaints/informations filed against appellant, but, also, the aggravating/qualifying circumstance that the second rape was committed in full view of appellant's daughter. Consequently, appellant may be convicted only of simple rape; hence, the trial court erred in imposing death penalty in both cases.
