				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 31, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 46, Urdaneta, Pangasinan in Criminal Case NO. U-9590, convicting Moreno Ocumen y Mendoza (alias Moring), appellant, of qualified rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death.&nbsp; He was further ordered to pay the victim, Russel Ocumen Rubio, the sum of P50,000 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information filed against appellant reads:<br><blockquote> "That on February 23, 1998, at Barangay Malokiat, Pozorrubio, Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with Russel Rubio y Ocumen, a minor 9 years old, and accused's own niece, or relative within the third civil degree, against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>"CONTRARY to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7679."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Upon arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge.&nbsp; Trial ensued thereafter.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution shows that Russel Ocumen Rubio was born on July 29, 1989 to spouses Rodolfo Rubio and Salvacion Ocumen as shown by the certified true copy of her Certificate of Live Birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> They live in Barangay Malokiat, Pozorrubio, Pangasinan.<br><br>On February 23, 1998, at about 8:00 o'clock in the morning, Russel, then nine (9) years old and a Grade III pupil, attended classes at the Don Benito Elementary School in Pozorrubio, Pangasinan.&nbsp; On her way home at 11:00 o'clock that same morning, she met appellant whom she identified in court as her uncle, he being the brother of her mother.&nbsp; Suddenly, he pulled her towards a forested area.&nbsp; There, he removed her shortpants and panty, after which he likewise removed his longpants and shorts.&nbsp; Then he made her lay on the ground and inserted his penis into her vagina. At the moment she felt pain and cried. Thereafter, she wore her shorts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At about the same time, Juan Flores, appellant's nephew, was walking towards the spring located at the <b>adjoining Barangay</b> <b>of Malokiat,</b> Pozzorubio to take a bath.&nbsp; While passing by the forested area, he saw from a distance of about 10 to 15 meters, the appellant on top of Russel.&nbsp; Flores observed that both were naked and that appellant was having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After the incident, Russel went home and met her grandmother Dominga Rubio, the mother of her father. When Dominga asked Russel where she came from, the latter revealed to her that she was sexually abused (<i>iniyot</i>) by appellant in a forested place near the road.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Immediately Dominga brought her to their barangay captain and reported the matter.&nbsp; They likewise sought assistance from the Police Station at Pozorrubio where they executed their respective sworn statements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> on the incident.<br><br>More than a week thereafter, or on March 6, 1998, Russel was physically examined by Dr. Francisco L. Llamas, chief of the Pozorrubio Community Hospital.&nbsp; He issued a Medical Certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the following findings:<br><blockquote> <table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"1.</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Victim is conscious, coherent, cooperative;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>2. </td> <td><div align="justify">No physical findings in other parts of the body;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>3. </td> <td><div align="justify">There is an <b>old (healed) laceration at 3 o'clock position of the hymen;</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>4.</td> <td> <div align="justify">Unable to insert even the lubricated little finger of the examiner.

(Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Dr. Llamas explained that the laceration of Russel's hymen was <b>more that a week old.</b>&nbsp; When he interviewed her, she disclosed that she was sexually molested by appellant, her own uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Appellant denied having raped Russel, whom he admitted is his own niece, she being the daughter of his sister Salvacion.&nbsp; He declared that on February 23, 1998, he was at home in Don Benito, Pozorrubio with his father, brothers and nephews, making some handicrafts.&nbsp; He claimed that the filing of the rape charge against him was instigated by Rodolfo, Russel's father, who felt slighted after he warned him not to manhandle his wife Salvacion every time they quarrel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Salvacion, Russels' mother, testified for the defense.&nbsp; She declared that appellant is her full-blooded brother.&nbsp; She observed nothing unusual with her daughter when she came home from school at around 11:45 in the morning of February 23, 1998. In fact, she went back to school after taking her lunch.&nbsp; Salvacion believed it was Dominga, her mother-in-law, who instigated the filing of the rape charge against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Segundo Ocumen and Jocelyn Ocumen, appellant's father and sister, respectively, corroborated appellant's claim that on the day in question they were all together in their house making handicrafts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Alfredo Tabor, a resident of Barangay Malokiat, Pozorrubio, Pangasinan, testified that in the morning of February 23, 1998, he was fishing in a spring at Barangay Malokiat, Pozorrubio. There, he saw Julia Rolio who was then washing clothes, and Juan Flores (a witness for the prosecution) about to take a bath.&nbsp; Between 11:00 and 12:00 o'clock noon that same day, he saw Russel Rubio and a classmate passed by. Appellant was not around nor was there an unusual incident that happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The trial court, in its Decision dated July 31, 1998, found appellant guilty of the crime charged and sentenced him to death, thus:<br><br><blockquote> "WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT of <b>CONVICTION</b> beyond reasonable doubt is hereby rendered against MORENO OCUMEN in CRIM. CASE NO. U-9590 of the crime of RAPE aggravated by relationship (between uncle and niece within the 3<sup>rd</sup> degree of consanguinity), and the Court hereby sentences MORENO OCUMEN to suffer the penalty of DEATH to be implemented in the manner as provided for by law.&nbsp; The accused is hereby ordered to pay Russel Rubio the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>Appellant, in his brief, ascribes to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> "I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ORDERING THE APPELLANT TO PAY PRIVATE COMPLAINANT THE SUM OF P50,000.00 AS MORAL DAMAGES AND P20,000.00 AS EXEMPLARY DAMAGES."<br></blockquote>Appellant contends that the prosecution's version of the incident is unworthy of belief.&nbsp; He argues that Salvacions's testimony that her daughter Russel had not shown any strange behavior upon coming home from school that day and that she even returned to school after taking her lunch, has effectively discredited the evidence for the prosecution.&nbsp; That Russel was not also crying, when she revealed the incident to her grandmother Dominga that day, likewise indicates that she was lying.<br><br>We are not impressed.<br><br>Our consistent pronouncement is that where, as here, the issue involves the assessment of credibility of witnesses, the reviewing court will not ordinarily disturb or set aside the findings of the trial court which gave due weight and credence to their testimonies. This is so because the trial court is in a better position to decide such issue, having personally heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.&nbsp; Such findings are accorded finality, unless the trial court has overlooked certain substantial and valuable facts appearing in the record which, if considered, might alter the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After a carefully reviewing the records, we find no cogent reason to disturb the findings and conclusions of the court below.<br><br>In giving full credence to Russel's declaration, it held:<br><blockquote> "The testimony of Russel is not rehearsed or directed.&nbsp; On the contrary, Russel testified in a manner reflective of a 9-year old child. She is positive and categorical, unswerving and sure of what she told the Court that her Uncle Moreno Ocumen pulled her to a forested area and afterwards, Ocumen removed her shortpant and panty.&nbsp; She further testified that Ocumen also removed his long pants and short, thereafter, Ocumen went on top of her. A portion of the penis of Ocumen was inserted to her vagina.&nbsp; The mere knocking at the door of the pudenda is sufficient to consummate the crime of rape (People vs. Abella, 228 SCRA 662 [1993]; <i>People vs. Tismo, 204 SCRA 535 [1991]).</i>&nbsp; It is likewise held that the briefest contact of the penis to the labia is enough to sustain conviction of a consummated rape (People vs. Evangelista, 282 SCRA 37 [1997]).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>"When Russel went home accompanied by Ocumen, she emphatically and immedaitely reported the matter to her grandmother, Dominga Rubio, the she was `<i>iniyot'</i> (sexually abused) by Ocumen.&nbsp; Together with her grandmother (Dominga), they went to the Brgy. Captain and thereafter, to the PNP Pozorrubio where the statements of Russel (Exhibit `E') and Dominga (Exhibit `B') were taken."<br></blockquote>The Trial Court has not overlooked substantial facts which could alter the result of the case.&nbsp; Its findings of fact are supported by evidence. Russel's narration has clearly established the charge that she was sexually ravished by appellant, thus:<br><blockquote> <table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"PROS.

The workings of the human mind under such a situation is unpredictable.&nbsp; Similarly, not every rape victim can be expected to act conformably to the usual expectations of every one â some may shout, some may faint, and some may be shocked into insensibility, while others may openly welcome the intrusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Thus, it is not proper to judge the actions of children who have undergone traumatic experiences by the norms of behavior expected from mature persons under similar circumstances.&nbsp; Indeed, we have not laid down any rule on how a rape victim should behave immediately after she has been abused.&nbsp; This experience is relative and may be dealt with in any way by the victim depending on the circumstances, but her credibility should not be tainted by any modicum of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>What is certain, though, is that Russel's testimony is not contrived, for it has been bolstered by Juan Flores' account of how appellant's lustful bestiality was forced on his helpless 9-year old niece.&nbsp; That her feminity was indeed shattered by appellant is consistent with the medical findings of Dr. Llamas that her hymen has an <b>old-healed laceration</b> at 3:00 o'clock position.<br><br>Appellant could not even explain why the prosecution witnesses testified against him.&nbsp; In any case, motive is never an essential element of a crime.&nbsp; It becomes inconsequential in a case where, as here, there are affirmative, nay, categorical declarations toward the appellant's culpability for the felony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In stark contrast to Russel's convincing recital of facts is appellant's hackneyed defense of denial and alibi.&nbsp; An intrinsically weak defense, denial must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability in order to merit credibility.&nbsp; It is a negative self-serving assertion that deserves no weight in law if unsubstantiated by clear&nbsp; and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Here, such defense cannot stand against the positive testimonies by both Russel and Juan Flores that appellant defiled her womanhood.<br><br>Appellant's claim that he was at home in Barangay Don Benito, Pozorrubio the whole day of February 23, 1998 making some handicrafts does not persuade us.&nbsp; Deeply imbedded in our jurisprudence is the rule that an accused who raises the defense of alibi must not only prove his presence at another place at the time of commission of the crime, he must also establish that it would be <b>physically impossible</b> for him to be at the scene of the crime during the incident.&nbsp; It bears stressing that both Barangays Don Benito and Malokiat <b>adjoin each other</b> and are <b>located within the municipality of Pozorrubio</b>.
