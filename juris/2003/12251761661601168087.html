He merely conducted a superficial examination which showed that four (4) wounds had been inflicted upon Mayor Cortez – one in the vicinity of the left nipple, one on the right axillary region, one on the right knee, and another on the left iliac region.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Building his case on the justifying circumstance of self-defense, petitioner presented a different version.

They were followed by several policemen who were instructed by Mayor Cortez "<i>to prepare for any eventuality</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> He was not able to collect the guns and have them tested by the NBI's ballistic technician because the policemen refused to submit themselves to an investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He recommended that the cases filed against petitioner be reviewed and/or investigated to prevent injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Lazarito Estorque recounted that on January 14, 1990, at about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon, he and Mayor Cortez were having a "drinking session" at the house of his<i> compadre </i>Bong Kadao.&nbsp; Mayor Cortez, together with his three (3) policemen, left Kadao's house at 7:00 o clock in the evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Consequently, two Informations for frustrated murder and murder, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 414 and 415, were filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch VII, Bayugan Agusan del Sur.&nbsp; Pursuant to this Court's Resolution dated August 2, 1990, the venue was transferred to the<b> RTC, Branch V, Butuan City </b>where the cases were docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 4194 and 4195.&nbsp; Before petitioner could be arraigned, the private prosecutor filed with the RTC a motion to refer the cases to the Sandiganbayan but it was denied in an Order dated March 11, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <b>Petitioner was then arraigned and pleaded not guilty to both charges</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The private prosecutor filed with this Court a petition for certiorari questioning the order of the RTC, but the same was dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This time, the public prosecutor filed with the RTC an Omnibus Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.

Indeed, [the accused] had no <i>personal motive to commit the crime and they would not have committed it had they not held their aforesaid offices</i></b>. . . .'"<br></blockquote>The Informations filed with the Sandiganbayan allege that petitioner, then a "public officer," committed the crimes of murder and frustrated murder "in relation to his office," i.e., as "Community Environment and Natural Resources Officer" of the DENR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It is apparent from this allegation that the offenses charged are intimately connected with petitioner's office and were perpetrated while he was in the performance of his official functions. In its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dated August 25, 1992, the Sandiganbayan held that petitioner was "on duty" during the incident; that the DENR Checkpoint "was put up in order to prevent incursions into the forest and wooded area;" and that petitioner, as a guard, was "precisely furnished with a firearm in order to resist entry by force or intimidation."&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, if petitioner was <b>not on duty at the DENR checkpoint on January 14, 1990</b>, he would not have had the bloody encounter with Mayor Cortez and his men.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Thus, based on the allegations in the Informations, the Sandiganbayan correctly assumed jurisdiction over the cases.<br><br>Significantly, while petitioner had already pleaded "not guilty" before the RTC, jeopardy did not attach as it did not acquire jurisdiction.&nbsp; There can be no double jeopardy where the accused entered a plea in court that had no jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>We now go to the substantial merits of the case.<br><br>After considering the records very closely, we are constrained to reject the evidence for the prosecution.

Gatillo in going to the DENR checkpoint. <b> Strangely, their conduct, upon arriving at that place, showed their concern more on the whereabouts of petitioner than whether there was gasoline to spare.</b>&nbsp; Pfc. Gatillo, testifying for the prosecution, admitted during cross-examination that he did not hear Mayor Cortez and Platero ask for gasoline.

Gatillo were looking for petitioner on the night of January 14, 1990? The records bear out that the relationship between Mayor Cortez and petitioner was not friendly.&nbsp; There were several occasions when their interests clashed - Mayor Cortez, as the owner of a sawmill, and petitioner, as a forest law enforcer.&nbsp; In his Sworn Statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> dated March 17, 1990, petitioner declared, among others, that previously, he apprehended the Mayor's men several times for illegally cutting and transporting "flitches" belonging to the Mayor and his family, thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><b>Q </b></td> <td width="5%"><b>20: </b></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"><b>After realizing that Mayor CORTEZ was the one who led the attack of the DENR CENTRO Strike Force Headquarters, what could be the reason why the Mayor and his men attacked your headquarters?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>A</b></td> <td><b>20:</b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>I believe that Mayor CORTEZ became angry with me because of the previous apprehensions of illegally cut and transported flitches which belonged to them, I mean, to that of Mayor CORTEZ family.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>Q</b></td> <td><b>21:</b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>&nbsp;Why, did the then Mayor also engaged (sic) in logging?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>A</b></td> <td><b>21:</b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>In one instance, we apprehended a truckload of illegally transported flitches and the document presented showed that they were consigned to the CORTEZ' sawmill in Bayugan, Agusan del Sur.</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>Q</b></td> <td><b>22:</b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Are there instances also that the mayor intervened in any way in the apprehensions of these illegally cut and transported logs?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><b>A</b></td> <td><b>22:</b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Sometime in September, 1989, when we apprehended a truck load of illegally cut and transported flitches, Mayor CORTEZ requested that the truck carrying the flitches be turned over to his custody which truck was the regular carrier of flitches consigned to their sawmill.

Decasa and Ali C. Vargas found that Mayor Cortez had an "ulterior motive of revenge" against petitioner, thus:<br><blockquote> "x x x<b> The investigating agents are inclined to believe that `the late Mayor Cortez must have some ulterior motive of revenge in going to the headquarters at that late hour of the night, armed with high-powered guns, together with policemen and bodyguards, and under the influence of liquor, especially so that it is of public knowledge that he had been&nbsp; harboring hatred towards ZAPATOS who had exhibited antagonism to his illegal activities.'"</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><b></b></blockquote><i>Third</i>, the account of Pfc. Gatillo and Platero that petitioner suddenly came out of the guardhouse and shot Mayor Cortez "<i>a matter of seconds</i>" after Tan ran towards the place is incredible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> <b>For one, both the prosecution and the defense witnesses testified that petitioner was sleeping inside the guardhouse. For another, Tan did not have the chance to wake petitioner prior to the shoot-out.</b>&nbsp; The prosecution witnesses admitted this fact.<br><br>Even before Tan could enter the guardhouse, he already heard the "burst of gunfire coming from outside of the checkpoint," prompting him to immediately run towards the backside of the guardhouse. <b> Now, to say that petitioner suddenly sprang from his slumber and shot Mayor Cortez without any reason is certainly at odds with common experience</b>.<br><br>Contrary to the findings of the Sandiganbayan, the totality of the contradictions, inconsistencies and flaws in the declarations of Platero and Pfc. Gatillo does not simply refer to minor or inconsequential details which may be justifiably overlooked, nor are they honest lapses which do not affect or impair the intrinsic value of their testimony.&nbsp; They relate instead to points material and essential to establish petitioner's culpability.&nbsp; The obliquity that pervades the prosecution's account of the incident creates the impression that it was rehearsed and concocted.<br><br>In contrast, the consistent testimonies of the defense witnesses, as well as the existing physical evidence, lend strong support to petitioner's plea of self-defense.<br><br>It is basic that for self-defense to prosper, the following requisites must concur:&nbsp; (1) there must be unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) that the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression were reasonable; and (3) that there was lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>All the aforestated requisites are present in this case.&nbsp; That there was unlawful aggression is clearly shown by the bullet-riddled guardhouse.&nbsp; It speaks eloquently than a hundred witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> We are convinced that Mayor Cortez, Platero and Pfc. Gatillo insisted to know petitioner's whereabouts and that upon learning that he was sleeping, executed the tyrannical attack.&nbsp; That they went to the DENR checkpoint with ready police back-up "<i>for any eventuality</i>" was proven not only by Pacheco Tan, but also by Lazarito Estorque and NBI Agent Decasa.&nbsp; Clearly, they proceeded to the checkpoint not on a mission of peace.<br><br>Taking into consideration the number of the aggressors, the nature and quality of their weapons, and the manner of the assault and the fact that petitioner was alone, we believe that petitioner's use of an armalite rifle to defend himself is reasonable.<br><br>Finally, that there was lack of sufficient provocation on petitioner's part is evidenced by the testimonies of the defense witnesses that he was sleeping inside the guardhouse prior to the initial shooting.&nbsp; Significantly, no evidence whatsoever was presented showing that he assaulted or provoked his aggressors into attacking him.<br><br>Petitioner's act of surrendering himself and his weapon to the authorities immediately the day after the incident dissipates any conjecture that he had a criminal mind when he fired his gun upon the victims.&nbsp; His courage to face his accuser, in spite of the opportunity to flee, indicates his innocence.<br><br>Thus, while it is true that the "factual findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and are even conclusive and binding" to this Court, this principle does not apply here.&nbsp; The findings of facts of the Sandiganbayan are not sufficiently established by evidence, leaving serious doubts in our minds regarding the culpability of petitioner.<br><br>In sum, we find that the prosecution failed to prove by evidence beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of herein petitioner for murder and frustrated murder.&nbsp; What is apparent is that Mayor Cortez and his men were the aggressors.&nbsp; Petitioner, who was just awakened by the gunfire, was justified in firing back at them.&nbsp; His act is in accordance with man's natural instinct to save his life from impending danger.&nbsp; We cannot expect him to simply retreat or wait for the bullet to hit and kill him.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated March 27, 2001 of the Sandiganbayan is <b>REVERSED</b> and petitioner is <b>ACQUITTED</b> of the crimes of murder and frustrated murder.<br><br>The Director of Prisons is hereby directed to cause the release of petitioner unless the latter is being lawfully held for another crime and to inform this Court accordingly within ten (10) days from notice.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Panganiban, Corona</i>, and <i>Carpio-Morales, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> "<i>That which anyone should do for the safety of his own person is to be adjudged as having been done justly in his own favor.</i>" See 1 Viada, 172, 5th edition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Justice Nicodemo T.
