Momentarily, a lady informant reported to P/Ins. Alfredo Francisco, the team leader, that a certain Rosdia was selling prohibited drugs at the second floor of Mindpro [Citymall]. P/Ins. Francisco brought the lady informant to PO3 Rivera. P/Ins. Francisco instructed PO3 Rivera to go with the informant and verify the report. And after confirming the report to be true, he should negotiate with the suspect to buy shabu worth <s>P</s>200,000.00. The informant told PO3 Rivera that Rosdia was a big-time pusher.<br><br>“PO3 Rivera and the lady informant proceeded to the second floor of Mindpro [Citymall] to look for Rosdia. After failing to find her at the mall, PO3 Rivera and the lady informant left. They agreed to return to the place the afternoon of the following day.<br><br>“In the afternoon of August 22, 1999, PO3 Rivera and the lady informant went to Mindpro [Citymall] and proceeded to the second floor where they saw Rosdia taking a snack in an eatery. The informant told PO3 Rivera that she alone would approach Rosdia. After talking briefly to Rosdia, the informant waved at PO3 Rivera to join them. The informant introduced Rosdia to PO3 Rivera saying: ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Nelson, si Rosdia, yong sinasabi ko sa iyo</span>.’ PO3 Rivera and Rosdia shook hands. PO3 Rivera introduced himself as Nelson Yap, while Rosdia introduced herself as Rosdia Hajili. Rosdia asked PO3 Rivera if he had money. PO3 Rivera told her that he had <s>P</s>200,000.00 which he left at the hotel. Rosdia told him that the amount was just equivalent to five (5) lowest. One (1) lowest is a pack of shabu weighing more or less 50 grams. PO3 Rivera agreed to buy five (5) lowest. They agreed to meet again at 11 o’clock the following morning at the same place. Rosdia told PO3 Rivera to bring the money. Thereafter, PO3 Rivera and the informant left. They agreed to meet at the gate of the puericulture center fronting the Mindpro [Citymall] between 10:00 to 10:30 in the morning of the following day.<br><br>“SPO3 Rivera returned to headquarters and reported what transpired to P/Insp. Francisco. They withdrew the amount of <s>P</s>200,000.00 from the Finance Section of the police. P/Insp. Francisco got a bag, put the money inside, and brought it to the office of Task Force Tumba Droga. P/Insp. Francisco conducted a short briefing on the planned buy-bust operation. The target of the buy-bust operation was a certain Rosdia Hajili who was frequently seen at Mindpro [Citymall]. PO3 Rivera was designated poseur-buyer while PO3 Alfredo S. Trumata would act as Rivera’s back-up. The other members of the team were assigned as perimeter guards. It was agreed that when PO3 Rivera remove[s] his bull cap, it would mean that the deal was consummated. The members of Task Force Tumba Droga Team present at the briefing were P/Insp. Alfredo Francisco, PO3 Enrique Rivera, SPO1 Eduardo Bernardo, SPO1 Amado Mirasol, SPO1 Marcelino Herbano, PO3 Alfredo Trumata, PO3 Renato dela Peña, PO3 Allan Obut, PO1 Yasser Salonga and PO1 Hilda Montuno.<br><br>“The next day, August 23, 1999, about 9 o’clock in the morning, PO3 Rivera and the rest of the members of the team were at the office of Task Force Tumba Droga. P/Insp. Francisco again conducted a short briefing. He reminded the members of the team to deploy themselves in strategic positions at the [Citymall] where they could not be seen. P/Insp. Francisco would post himself near the toilet where he could see PO3 Rivera. P/Ins Francisco handed over to PO3 Rivera the bag containing <s>P</s>200,000.00 in bundles of <s>P</s>10,000.00 each. The members of the team then proceeded to Mindpro [Citymall]. SPO3 Rivera boarded his motorcycle followed by the other members.<br><br>“About an hour later, SPO3 Rivera and the informant met. They proceeded to the second floor of Mindpro [Citymall] where they waited for Rosdia Hajili. Moments later, Rosdia arrived and approached PO3 Rivera and the lady informant. She asked SPO3 Rivera if he had the money with him. PO3 Rivera opened the bag and showed the contents to her. PO3 Rivera counted one bundle amounting to <s>P</s>10,000.00 in the presence of Rosdia. He took a <s>P</s>100.00 bill and gave it to the lady informant. He told the informant to buy snacks for them. After Rosdia was convinced, she told PO3 Rivera to come back at 2 o’clock in the afternoon in the same place to finalize their transaction.<br><br>“At 1:30 in the afternoon, after a short briefing in their office, PO3 Rivera and the other members of the Task Force Tumba Droga Team returned to Mindpro [Citymall]. He brought the black bag containing marked money in the lesser amount of <s>P</s>6,000.00 and crumpled bond paper. Rosdia arrived at 2 o’clock in the afternoon accompanied by a man and a woman. Rosdia told PO3 Rivera that they would finalize the transaction at Baliwasan Chico, Sampaloc Drive. At first, PO3 Rivera expressed apprehension in bringing a big amount of money in that critical place. Rosdia, however, told him not to worry as she was from that place. PO3 Rivera excused himself. He went to the comfort room. He was followed inside by P/Insp. Francisco. PO3 Rivera informed Francisco that the transaction would be finalized in Baliwasan Chico, at Sampaloc Drive. P/Insp. Francisco told PO3 Rivera to go ahead because members of the team would be there. PO3 Rivera returned to their table. Rosdia Hajili and her two companions went down and boarded a tricycle. PO3 Rivera and the lady informant followed in another tricycle. The two tricycles headed towards Baliwasan Chico. P/Insp. Francisco and his team members furtively followed the two tricycles.<br><br>“The group arrived at Baliwasan Chico about 2:45 in the afternoon. Rosdia and her companions, together with PO3 Rivera and the lady informant, passed through a blue steel gate and into a bungalow house. Rosdia talked to one of its occupants. PO3 Rivera, the lady informant and Rosdia’s two companions were left waiting at the terrace. Rosdia returned to the terrace and told PO3 Rivera and the lady informant that the house belonged to her friend. Rosdia instructed her companions to summon a certain Normina. Rosdia’s companions left and proceeded to the interior portion of Sapang Palay. After a few minutes, Rosdia’s companions returned with Normina Unday. Rosdia’s companions then left the house. Rosdia instructed Normina to get the shabu. Normina also went out and headed for Sapang Palay.<br><br>“A few minutes later, Normina Unday returned bringing with her a folded white plastic bag clasped under her armpit. She gave it to Rosdia Hajili. Rosdia inspected the contents of the white plastic bag and handed it over to PO3 Rivera. She told PO3 Rivera: ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Lima yan</span>.’ PO3 Rivera inspected the white plastic bag with the label TONG’S, containing five (5) transparent plastic packs of crystalline substance. PO3 Rivera then gave the pre-arranged signal to the buy-bust team members by removing his bull cap. Rosdia Hajili asked PO3 Rivera, ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Yung pera?</span>’ PO3 Rivera pretended to open the bag he was carrying. At that juncture, PO3 Rivera noticed the group of P/Sr. Insp. Francisco and PO3 Trumata entering the gate. PO3 Rivera identified himself as a policeman. He told Rosdia Hajili and Normina Unday that they were both under arrest. Normina Unday attempted to run but PO3 Rivera grabbed hold of her wrist and made her sit on the bench. Rosdia Hajili remained seated on the bench and did not offer any resistance.<br><br>“PO3 Alfredo Trumata placed Rosdia Hajili under arrest. He confiscated from her a brown shoulder bag with brand name BON containing a medium size transparent plastic pack of suspected shabu.<br><br>“PO3 Rivera turned over to the investigator, PO3 Dela Peña, the white plastic bag, marked TONG’S, containing five (5) big transparent plastic packs which contained white crystalline substance and the marked money in <s>P</s>100.00 bills amounting to <s>P</s>6,000.00 placed in two (2) brown mailing envelopes which were, in turn, placed inside a black bag. PO3 Trumata turned over a brown shoulder bag with brand name ‘BON’ which he confiscated from Rosdia Hajili. Inside, PO3 Trumata found a medium[-sized] heat-sealed transparent plastic pack containing suspected shabu.<br><br>“After their arrest, Rosdia Hajili and Normina Unday were brought to the police station. PO3 Rivera placed his markings ‘ECR’ (Enrique Climaco Rivera) on the confiscated items at the Office of Task Force Tumba Droga, particularly on the white plastic bag with the label TONG’S and on the five (5) big transparent plastic packs containing suspected shabu.<br><br>“P/Sr. Insp. Mercedes Delfin-Diestro, Forensic Chemist, PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office 9, conducted laboratory tests on the five (5) big transparent plastic packs containing white crystalline substance with a total weight of 241.6338 grams and one (1) medium-sized transparent plastic pack containing white crystalline substance, weighing 4.0889 grams. The specimens submitted proved POSITIVE for METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (shabu), a regulated drug.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Version of the Defense</span></span><br></div><br>Denying the charges and claiming to be victims of a police frame-up, appellants present their version of the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>“x x x. Rosdia Hajili y Jayadi, testified that x x x [s]he was previously arrested by the police and charged in court in connection with the violation of the Anti-Fencing Law, wherein she was detained and later acquitted. Among the arresting policemen was PO3 Trumata. On the day in question, August 22, 1999, she denies being at the Mindpro [Citymall] in the afternoon of the said date, since it was a Sunday, and that on the afternoon she had attended a wedding at the Garden Orchids Hotel together with Evangeline Asmad y Ayani who testified she met her neighbor, Appellant Rosdia Hajili. They even had their picture at the wedding taken together with Helen Sakkam. Appellant Hajili further aver x x x that she never went to Mindpro Citymall on that fateful day. As she was feeling ill and so much so that she had to go see a quack doctor (‘<span style="font-style: italic;">tawal-tawal</span>’) for her fever at the house of Hadja Fatima in Baliwasan Chico. While she was being treated by Delma Abubakar, the quack doctor, policemen suddenly entered the house, among one of them was whom she recognized as PO3 Rivera in connection with her case for violation of the Anti-Fencing Law. She further declared before August 21, 22 and 23, 1999 she knew Rivera was a Police Officer.<br><br>“On the other hand, Accused-Appellant x x x Normina Unday y Aloh, testified that x x x [s]he came to Zamboanga City for the first time on August 14, 1999 with her sister who was leaving for Saudi Arabia. They stayed at the house of Hadja Fatima who is the friend of her sister. When her sister left for Saudi Arabia, she was employed as a house helper of Hadja Fatima. She further avers that on the afternoon of August 23, 1999, she was inside the bathroom of Hadja Fatima’s house taking a bath and washing clothes when suddenly there was a knock at the door. Upon opening it she was confronted by a policeman holding a pistol by the door who brought her to the sala where x x x other policemen [were] gathered. At that time she was still wet. The policeman talked to them nicely that they will bring her and Rosdia Hajili to the police station and afterwards they will bring them back home. They were then taken to the police station at Sta. Barbara. After being searched they were then brought to the police station at Divisoria [where] they stayed for two nights, after which they were then brought to the city jail. Accused-Appellant Unday further x x x denies that she brought shabu upon the instruction of Accused-Appellant Rosdia Hajili to the house of Hadja Fatima. She said that she has not sold shabu to anyone at any time.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>The trial court gave credence to the evidence of the prosecution and found the buy-bust operation lawful. It held that the apprehending police officers could not have merely concocted the facts, which they had clearly and convincingly narrated in their respective testimonies. Thus, it upheld the presumption that they had performed their duties in a regular manner, since no evidence to the contrary had been presented.<br><br>Moreover, the trial court rejected appellants’ defense of frame-up, because it found the testimonies of the accused and their witnesses to be dubious and unconvincing. It declared as suspicious the statement that the police officers had simply barged into the house and escorted both of the accused to the police station without any explanation. It was convinced that the policemen had been led to the house by the accused Hajili in connection with a drug transaction she had previously arranged with PO3 Rivera.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In their Brief, appellants raise the following assignment of errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">“I<br></div><br>That the court a quo erred when it did not dismiss the charges against both appellants on the ground that their guilt was not prove[n] beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“II<br></div><br>The trial court erred when it held there was conspiracy between the two appellants.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">“III<br></div><br>The trial court erred when it resolved the case against both appellants because public officers have in their favor the presumption that they did their job regularly in the performance of their duties.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>In short, appellants are questioning (1) the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and (2) the regularity of the conduct of the buy-bust operation.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">First Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</span></span><br></div><br>In a prosecution for illegal <span style="font-style: italic;">sale</span> of dangerous drugs, the following elements must first be established: (1) proof that the transaction or sale took place and (2) the presentation in court of the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> or the illicit drug as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in a prosecution for illegal <span style="font-style: italic;">possession</span> of a dangerous drug, it must be shown that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>A review of the records and the transcripts of stenographic notes of these cases reveals that the prosecution has proven the presence of these elements.<br><br>Prosecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation. Furthermore, this Court is guided by the entrenched rule that the assessment of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court, which had the opportunity to observe the demeanor, conduct or attitude of the witnesses. The findings of the lower court on this point are accorded great respect and will not be reversed on appeal, unless it overlooked substantial facts and circumstances which, if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>PO3 Enrique Rivera, the poseur-buyer in the buy-bust operation, positively identified Hajili and Unday as the peddlers of the confiscated shabu.

The allegation that Appellant Hajili knew the poseur-buyer to be a policeman is not a ground for inferring that she could not have sold the illegal drugs to him. Such sales to police officers do take place nowadays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the prosecution was able to establish that the substance obtained from appellants was shabu. Physical Sciences Report No. D-531-99<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> states: “Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimen gave POSITIVE result to the tests for the presence of METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (shabu), a regulated drug.”<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Conspiracy</span></span><br><br>We are not persuaded by the argument of appellants that conspiracy was not duly proven. Their behavior during the entrapment shows that there was conspiracy between them. Direct proof is not essential to the establishment of conspiracy, as it may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime. All such acts imply conspiracy when they indubitably point to or indicate a joint purpose, a concert of action and a community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Defense of Frame-up or Hulidap</span></span><br></div><br>Appellants contend that they are victims of a police frame-up or <span style="font-style: italic;">hulidap</span>. They assert that without any authority, permission or search warrant, the police officers suddenly barged into the house where they were staying and demanded money from its occupants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>We are not convinced. Once the elements of a crime have been established, the defense of frame-up or <span style="font-style: italic;">hulidap</span> must be clearly proven by the defense. This defense is difficult to substantiate, as we have held in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Chen Tiz Chang</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>“Courts generally view with disfavor this defense commonly raised in drug cases, for it is easy to concoct and difficult to prove. Moreover, there is a presumption that public officers, including the arresting officers, regularly perform their official duties. In the present case, the defense failed to overcome this presumption to present clear and convincing evidence to prove ‘hulidap.’”<br></blockquote>In the cases at bar, the defense failed to support its allegations. The testimonies of appellants and other defense witnesses are silent on the claim that the apprehending policemen demanded hush money. Also, as aptly observed by the trial court, assuming that appellants had been brought to the police station and detained without any explanation, they could have filed charges -- administrative or criminal -- against the policemen. No complaints, however, were ever reported.<br><br>Likewise, we find no merit in appellants’ claim that the Zamboanga City policemen’s use of the same method in conducting buy-bust operations is a reflection of the irregularity of the procedure. It must be noted that there is no rigid or textbook method of conducting buy-bust operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The choice of effective ways to apprehend drug dealers is within the ambit of police authority. Police officers have the expertise to determine which specific approaches are necessary to enforce their entrapment operations. The courts’ duty in these cases is to ensure that the rights of the accused have not been violated during buy-bust operations.<br><br>Finally, the reliance of appellants on <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.
