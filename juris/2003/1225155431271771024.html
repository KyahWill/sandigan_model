				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. ZALDY LABIANO Y PAGTAN, APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Zaldy Labiano was charged with rape under an accusatory Information that read:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned 3<sup>rd</sup> Asst. City Prosecutor hereby accuses ZALDY LABIANO Y PAGTAN, of the crime of RAPE, at the instance, relation and the written sworn complaint of SOLEDAD DILEM Y CAGUITE.&nbsp; Copies of her statement are hereto attached, incorporated and made an integral part of this Information, committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about the 18<sup>th</sup> day of December, 1994 in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously and by means of force and intimidation, have carnal knowledge of the said complainant, SOLEDAD DILEM Y CAGUITE, against </blockquote>her will and consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>At his arraignment, Zaldy Labiano entered a plea of "not guilty."&nbsp; The trial ensued with the prosecution first presenting its case and the defense following shortly thereafter.<br><br>On the witness stand, 21-year old Soledad Dilem-Pacada narrated that, on the early morning of 18 December 1994, she was in a rented room in the house of a certain Mrs. Aydoc at Sanitary Camp, Baguio City.&nbsp; She was all alone as the two other occupants of the house were not yet home.&nbsp; The light cast by the incandescent full moon that shone through the glass-windows illuminated the small room.&nbsp; She was awakened, about two o'clock, from sleep when the plastic curtain rustled on her window.&nbsp; She saw a man who immediately held her hands.&nbsp; She asked, "<i>mama, sino ka ba?&nbsp; bakit ka nandito?</i>"&nbsp; He told her "<i>sorry ka na lang,</i>" and he poked a knife at her neck.&nbsp; Soon, the stranger removed her shorts and sleeveless top with his right hand while his left hand held on to the knife.&nbsp; She tried to push him away but he threatened her with death if she were to resist him.&nbsp; She was so frightened that she did not move.&nbsp; With his feet, he completely pulled down her shorts and panties below her knees.&nbsp; He then unbuttoned his pants and pushed it down with his right hand.&nbsp; Lying fearfully silent on the bed, Soledad could only watch as the stranger inserted his penis into her.&nbsp; She tried to move her buttocks to avoid the thrusts but he simply pounded his weight on her.&nbsp; The man stayed on her for about ten minutes while she looked at his face intently.&nbsp; She recognized him to be Zaldy Labiano, a resident of Sanitary Camp.&nbsp; When he ejaculated, he retrieved his pants and told her not to report what had just transpired to anybody or he would come back and kill her.&nbsp; She asked for his name, and he said, "Ricardo."&nbsp; When he had left, she cried and thought that she would be unable to face her parents, relatives, friends and her boyfriend.<br><br>Later, about six o'clock of the same day, she went to her friend Flordeliza Tigwa and told her what had happened just a few hours before.&nbsp; Flordeliza advised her to report the incident to the <i>Barangay</i> Captain who then accompanied them to the police station.&nbsp; Soledad was later brought to the Baguio General Hospital for medical examination.&nbsp; Dr. Susan Chungalao who performed the examination testified that she found an old healed laceration at the hymen but sperm cells were present in Soledad's vagina which could indicate that she had a recent sexual contact. <br><br>Zaldy Labiano denied the accusation.&nbsp; He claimed that he was at home taking care of his children during the time the alleged rape took place. According to him, he only learned that he was being accused of rape in the afternoon of 18 December 1994.&nbsp; With his father, he went to the police station only to inquire about the reported complaint filed by Soledad but, to his dismay, a certain SPO4 Romulo Danglose forced him to admit his complicity to the crime.<br><br><i>Barangay </i>Captain Esteban Rifani testified that Soledad came to see him on 17 December 1994, not on 18 December 1994, to report the rape incident.&nbsp; Soledad could not, at the time, identify her assailant, and he thus merely entered the complaint in the <i>Barangay</i> Logbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rosario Colantes, a boarder at Mrs. Aydoc's house, stated that on 17 December 1994 Soledad had asked whether she knew anyone by the name of "Ricardo."&nbsp; Mrs. Aydoc informed her that Soledad was raped. Corazon Manuel Gumnad, the live-in partner of Labiano, declared that the latter was with her, and that he never left their house on 17 December 1994.<br><br>When the trial concluded, the court <i>a quo </i>convicted Zaldy Labiano of the crime for which he was indicted.&nbsp; The trial court held that Soledad's positive identification of her defiler, with whom she had come face to face, deserved credence.&nbsp; It also opined that the sperm cells found in Soledad's vagina bolstered her claim of sexual abuse.&nbsp; The dispositive portions of the decision read:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered convicting the accused Zaldy Labiano of the crime of rape as charged and hereby sentences him after taking into consideration Art. 63 of the Revised Penal Code to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua.<br><br>"With respect to the civil aspect, the accused is hereby ordered to indemnify private complainant Soledad [Dilem] in the amount of P75,000.00 and further to pay said private complainant the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>The convicted accused, now appellant, seeks the reversal of his conviction.&nbsp; He raises two simple issues: (a) whether or not he is guilty of the crime charged, and (b) whether or not he is liable for damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Appellant argues that the trial court has erred in appreciating the testimony of Soledad.<br><br>As has so often been stated by this Court, the issue of credibility is a matter best addressed by the trial court which gets a good chance, unlike that of an appellate court, to observe the demeanor of the declarant at the witness stand, and that, in the absence of any fact or circumstance of substance that has apparently been overlooked, its findings on the reliability of the testimony given before it are not thus disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The records in this case yield no evident trace that any such significant fact or circumstance has been missed out. Soledad has testified thusly:nona<br><blockquote><blockqoute><table Â ="" border="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td scope="row" valign="top" width="6%"><div align="left">"Q </div></td> <td
