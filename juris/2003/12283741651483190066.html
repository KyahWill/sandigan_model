After the bail hearing, the respective counsel for the different parties manifested their agreement that the case be decided on the merits since they had presented all their witnesses. The trial court thus considered the case submitted for decision.<br><br><center><i>The Prosecution’s Evidence</i><br></center><br><b>Romeo Barsaga</b>, a mat vendor and a resident of Bacacay, Albay, testified that on October 5, 1997, he was in the house of the victim Juanito Bongon, Sr. in Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, bringing with him mats for sale. Juanito Bongon, Sr. was in charge of delivering the mats. Barsaga had been in Siba-o several times for the same purpose and would stay in the residence of Juanito Bongon, Sr. for about three days until he received the proceeds of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At around 6:00 o’ clock in the evening of the said date, Barsaga went out to buy cigarettes at the store near the house of Floserfida “Puring” Fabricante. Before he could reach the store, he saw, at a distance of seven (7) meters, three (3) persons hitting Juanito Bongon, Sr. on the head with pieces of wood and a bolo. He recognized the faces of the assailants, but did not know their names. Nevertheless, in court, Barsaga pointed at the man whom he saw strike the victim with a bolo who identified himself as Bonifacio Aliben. Barsaga also pointed at the two persons whom he saw hit the victim with pieces of wood and they identified themselves as Ronnie Nicolas and Diosdado Nicolas. Barsaga declared that he recognized the faces of the assailants becaused he saw them often at the store whenever he was in Siba-o.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Barsaga watched the incident for about four (4) minutes. While Aliben was hacking the victim, Diosdado Nicolas and Ronnie Nicolas were at the back of the victim. The witness demonstrated the position of the victim while he was being attacked by appellants by bowing his head, bending his body towards the ground with his two hands in front of his chest. Barsaga could not remember how many times Aliben hacked the victim and did not see which part of the victim’s body was hit. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Barsaga further testified that he got scared after witnessing the incident, so he returned to the house of the victim. He narrated what he witnessed to the mother of the victim and a child who were the only ones present during that time. The following day, he went home to Bacacay because his mats were already sold. He learned that Juanito Bongon, Sr. was already dead from the relatives of the victim in Bacacay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b>Floserfida Fabricante</b>, sister of the victim, testified that at around 6:00 o’ clock in the evening of October 5, 1997, she was in her residence. She heard a noise that sounded as though someone was being mauled. She went outside the house and saw Bonifacio “Pacio” Aliben hacking a person with a bolo, while Diosdado “Dado” Nicolas and Ronnie Nicolas were also hitting the same person with a piece of wood many times. She saw Aliben hack the victim once on the upper right side of the head, just above the forehead. She did not recognize the victim because he was already lying down. She was about ten (10) meters away from the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After witnessing the incident, Fabricante went inside her house and drank water because she was scared. After a while, Josefa Bongon arrived and asked Fabricante if she knew the whereabouts of her husband Juanito Bongon, Sr. Fabricante replied that she did not know. She informed Josefa Bongon that a person was mauled outside her house and told her to inquire about it. Josefa Bongon and her son went to the place of the incident. Afterwards, Fabricante heard Josefa shouting for help. The following day, October 6, 1997, Fabricante learned that Juanito Bongon, Sr. was already dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b>Juanito Bongon, Jr.</b>, the victim’s son and a <i>padyak</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (tricycle) driver, testified that at around 6:00 o’ clock in the evening of October 5, 1997, he was in Siba-o, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, driving his <i>padyak</i>. He was taking two passengers, Raquel Seguenza and Dalia Requinta, to their respective residences in Siba-o. After his two passengers had alighted from the <i>padyak</i>, Bongon, Jr. made a U-turn to proceed to the town proper of Siba-o at which instance he saw appellant Bonifacio Aliben holding a 24-inch-bolo stained with blood. Rommel Cabiles then approached Bongon, Jr. and told him that a person was mauled. Wanting to help the victim, Bongon, Jr. drove to the place of the incident, which was about five (5) meters away from the house of Ester Nicolas in Siba-o. Bongon, Jr. saw the victim lying with his face down on the ground, still moaning. He carried the victim and placed him inside his <i>padyak</i>. After he turned on the motor and the lights of the <i>padyak</i>, he recognized the victim to be his father, Juanito Bongon, Sr. He immediately asked his father who mauled him. His father answered Dado and Ronnie, and was about to say more, but his serious physical condition prevented him from doing so. By this time, the mother and brother of Bongon, Jr. had arrived. They rushed the victim to the Bicol Regional Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><b>Josefa Bongon </b>(“Josefa” for brevity), wife of the victim, testified that at around 6:00 o’ clock in the evening of October 5, 1997, she left the house leaving behind her mother-in-law, her youngest son and Romeo Barsaga. On her way to their other house in Siba-o, she saw people running around. She was not able to reach their other house because Dado Nicolas suddenly appeared and was about to bump her. Dado Nicolas was running fast, away from the direction where the incident happened. Josefa was then looking for her husband. She saw Pepito Seguenza who told her that he did not see her husband. She immediately proceeded back to their house. While she was about three arms length away from their house, she saw her son carrying the body of her husband, which he placed inside his <i>padyak</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Josefa testified that while her husband was on board the <i>padyak</i>, her son Jojo asked her husband who mauled him. Her husband uttered the names Dado and Ronnie, and was about to say something more, but he was already choking. The only persons she knew in their barangay with the names Dado and Ronnie were Dado Nicolas and Ronnie Nicolas. They brought her husband to the Regional Hospital, but her husband was already dead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Josefa testified that they spent P13,000.00 for the funeral services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She borrowed money from the cooperative to defray the funeral expenses of her husband.

As Raquel Seguenza was about to alight, the <i>padyak</i> slowly turned to the right and its headlight focused on the hand of appellant Bonifacio Aliben who was holding a 17-inch-bolo stained with blood. Aliben was one (1) meter away from the <i>padyak</i> and was walking toward the direction of his residence. She knew the appellants because they resided in the same barangay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>Pepito Seguenza</b> corroborated the testimony of Dalia Requinta. He testified that at around 6:00 o’ clock in the evening of October 5, 1997, he was in his house drinking with a visitor. While drinking, he noticed that there was a commotion outside his house. He went out and while going outside their front yard, he saw appellant Bonifacio Aliben walking fast with a bloodstained bolo in his hand. He saw that Aliben’s bolo was bloody because the headlight of a “motor” lighted Aliben’s hand. Aliben was walking toward the direction of his residence. Seguenza went to the road, and after a while, Mrs. Bongon and her son, Juanito Bongon, Jr. arrived riding in a <i>padyak</i>. Mrs. Bongon was shouting for help, so Seguenza boarded the <i>padyak</i> and went with them to bring the victim Juanito Bongon, Sr. to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>Dr. Rey Millena</b>, municipal health officer of Calabanga, Camarines Sur, conducted the autopsy of the body of the victim.

He explained that “comminuted fracture” means splintering or fragmentation of the skull bone. Fragmentation of the bone was concentrated at the right frontal of the right side of the forehead. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The second internal finding showed that the victim sustained “comminuted fractures left parietal bone, near the vertex.” Dr. Millena explained that the parietal bone was near the vertex or top of the skull.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The third internal finding showed that the meninges or the protective covering of the brain was lacerated and the anterior brain tissues were crushed and displaced posteriorly.

He also found an incised wound, seven (7) centimeters long, at the right side of the victim’s head, which may have been caused by a sharp-edged instrument. Hence, Dr. Millena concluded that more than one instrument was used in inflicting the injuries sustained by the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Dr. Millena declared that the injuries sustained by the victim were fatal injuries. The injuries immediately caused cardio-respiratory arrest due to comminuted skull fractures which caused the victim’s death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Dr. Millena testified that the most fatal injuries sustained by the victim were those on the right side of his forehead corresponding to the first internal finding.

The court also admitted in evidence the dying declaration of the victim Juanito Bongon, Sr. naming Dado and Ronnie as his assailants.

The court ruled that the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses prevailed over the denial and alibi of appellants Diosdado Nicolas and Bonifacio Aliben.<br><br>The trial court rejected the theory of self-defense of appellant Ronnie Nicolas because the latter continued hitting the victim after he had immobilized him by hitting him on the head.

First, Barsaga was just seven (7) meters away from the place of the incident, but he did nothing except watch his friend being beaten up. Second, Barsaga neither shouted nor sought assistance. Third, he did not report the incident to any member of the family except to the victim’s mother and a Grade One boy who were not capable of responding to the incident. Barsaga could not even name the victim’s mother and the boy although he had stayed in the victim’s house on several occasions. Fourth, Barsaga went home to Bacacay, Albay after the incident instead of rendering assistance to the victim’s family or inquiring about the condition of his friend.<br><br>Appellants’ contention is not tenable.<br><br>Different people react differently to an unusual event, and there is no standard form of behavior when an individual witnesses something so shocking or gruesome as murder especially if the assailant is near.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Reluctance to get involved in the criminal incident is not an unnatural reaction of some individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Barsaga testified that he got scared after witnessing appellants attack the victim, Juanito Bongon, Sr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, he returned to the victim’s house where he was then staying and immediately informed the victim’s mother and a certain boy about what he had witnessed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The wife and children of the victim were not around then and he later learned that they brought the victim to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The reaction of Barsaga upon witnessing the incident and Barsaga’s failure to state the names of the victim’s mother and the boy to whom he narrated the incident pertain to collateral matters, which do not touch upon the commission of the crime itself and do not detract from the positive identification of appellants as the assailants, and therefore do not affect the substance, veracity or weight of his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The fact that Barsaga went home the day after the incident, knowing that the victim was already in the hospital, in no way impairs his credibility.<br><br>Appellants further question the credibility of Barsaga because he testified that the victim was repeatedly hacked by appellant Bonifacio Aliben with a bolo, but could not tell how many times the victim was hacked and which part his body was hit.

They insist that the normal tendency of attackers is to hit the victim in whatever part of the body is exposed to them. Hence, it was unthinkable that Ronnie Nicolas and Diosdado Nicolas would be hitting the head of the victim with a piece of wood simultaneously, while Aliben was likewise hacking the head of the victim.<br><br>The Solicitor General correctly countered that there is no such “normal tendency” in attacking a victim, as a malefactor could attack his victim in any part of the body he chooses and in any manner he pleases. There is no standard manner or form of executing a criminal design. Significantly, Dr. Rey Millena, who autopsied the body of the victim, testified that he found no sign of physical injuries at the upper and lower extremities of the victim’s body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> He found that the injuries were more or less concentrated on the head and face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Dr. Millena’s findings, therefore, supported the testimony of Fabricante that the appellants concentrated their attack on the victim’s head.<br><br>Appellants also point out the alleged inconsistent testimonies of Barsaga and Fabricante. Barsaga allegedly testified that he was going to the store of Puring to buy cigarettes when he saw the incident, while Fabricante, whose nickname was Puring, testified that she was not operating a store.<br><br>We found no inconsistency in their statements.

They point to the contradictory testimonies of Juanito Bongon, Jr. and Josefa Bongon as to the exact instance when the victim gave his dying declaration and on the manner the victim was retrieved from the place of the incident.<br><br>Appellants contend that Juanito Bongon, Jr. testified that it was only <i>after</i> he started the engine of the motorized <i>padyak </i>which turned on its lights that he was able to recognize that the victim he placed on his <i>padyak</i> was his father. It was at this juncture when he asked his father who his assailants were and that his father answered Dado and Ronnie. Appellants argue that Juanito Bongon, Jr. never testified that the dying declaration of his father was made in the presence of his mother Josefa Bongon. However, Josefa Bongon testified that she was present and heard the dying declaration of her husband. Josefa Bongon also declared that her husband gave his dying declaration to her son <i>before</i> the motorized <i>padyak</i> was started, which is inconsistent with the testimony of Juanito Bongon, Jr.<br><br>The transcript of stenographic notes shows otherwise. Juanito Bongon, Jr. testified on cross-examination that his mother Josefa Bongon and his brother arrived when he placed the body of his father inside his <i>padyak.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> This was before he turned on the motor and the lights of his <i>padyak</i>, which enabled him to recognize the victim to be his father. It was only when Bongon, Jr. recognized that the victim was his father that he elicited his father’s dying declaration. Hence, the testimonies of Juanito Bongon, Jr. and Josefa Bongon were consistent on her presence when the victim gave his dying declaration.<br><br>Although Josefa Bongon testified that her son Juanito Bongon, Jr. asked his father who mauled him <i>before</i> he started his <i>padyak</i>, which differs from her son’s testimony, said inconsistency refers to a minor detail which does not impair the essential integrity of the prosecution’s evidence as a whole or detract from the witnesses’ testimonies that the victim gave a dying declaration naming Dado and Ronnie as his assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> On the contrary, said inconsistency tends to strengthen the credibility of the prosecution witnesses because it erases the suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The allegations of appellants that there were inconsistencies in the testimonies of Fabricante and Josefa Bongon regarding the manner the victim was retrieved from the place of the incident likewise refer to minor details and collateral matters, which do not touch upon the commission of the crime itself or detract from the positive identification of the appellants as the assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Therefore, the alleged inconsistencies do not affect the substance of the prosecution witnesses’ declarations, their veracity, or the weight of their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Appellants also contend that based on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the victim was already dead when he was found, so he could not have uttered his dying declaration. This conclusion was allegedly supported by Dr. Rey Millena who testified that based on the fatal injuries sustained by the victim, there was no possibility for the victim to talk because his injuries would cause his immediate death. Hence, appellants insist that it was error for the trial court to consider the alleged dying declaration of the victim.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>According to the trial court, although the doctor testified that based on his post-mortem examination, the victim could have died immediately after sustaining the injuries on the right side of his head, Josefa Bongon and Juanito Bongon, Jr. however testified that the victim remained alive for a few seconds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Bongon, Jr. testified that when he saw the victim, he was still alive, moaning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> After he carried the victim to his <i>padyak</i>, the victim was able to reply to his question as to the identity of his assailants by uttering the names Dado and Ronnie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The victim was about to say more but his serious physical condition prevented him from doing so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>We agree with the Solicitor General that there is no evidence or any indication showing that a dubious reason or improper motive impelled Juanito Bongon, Jr. to make a false testimony; thus, his testimony deserves full faith and credence. It would be unnatural for the victim’s relatives to commit an injustice by taking the witness stand and imputing the crime to innocent persons and not to those who were actually responsible therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Hence, the trial court did not err when it believed the testimonies of Josefa Bongon and Juanito Bongon, Jr. that Juanito Bongon, Sr. was able to name his assailants before he died.<br><br>For a dying declaration to be admissible in evidence, the following requisites must concur: (1) the dying declaration must concern the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant’s death; (2) at the time of making his declaration, the declarant was under a consciousness of impending death; (3) the declarant must have been competent to testify as a witness; and (4) the declaration was offered in a criminal case for homicide, murder or parricide in which the declarant was the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>These requisites are present in the case at bar. The injuries sustained by the victim were serious enough to make the declarant conscious of impending death, which in fact occurred even before he reached the hospital. His declaration, which identified his assailants, referred to the cause of his death. The declarant was competent to testify as a witness if he had been called upon to give testimony in court. The declarant’s dying declaration was offered in this case wherein he is the victim. Having satisfied all the aforementioned requisites, the trial court did not err in admitting in evidence the victim’s dying declaration. A dying declaration is an exception to the hearsay rule, because of its necessity and trustworthiness:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Necessity, because the declarant’s death makes it impossible for him to take the witness stand; and trustworthiness, because when a person is at the point of death, every motive for falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by the most powerful consideration to speak the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br><center><i>Third Issue: The number of weapons used to commit the crime</i><br></center><br>Appellants next contend that the trial court erred in ruling that more than one instrument was used in attacking the victim.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Dr. Millena, who conducted the autopsy of the body of the victim, testified that the victim’s internal injuries, consisting of fractures on the head and the face, were caused by a blunt instrument, while the incised wound on the right side of the victim’s head may have been caused by a sharp-edged instrument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Hence, the trial court correctly ruled that more than one instrument was used in inflicting the injuries sustained by the victim, which was supported by the findings of Dr. Millena.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><center><i>Fourth Issue: Presence of Conspiracy</i><br></center><br>Appellants also contend that the trial court erred in ruling that there was conspiracy among them in the commission of the crime.<br><br>The contention is without merit.<br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In the absence of direct proof of conspiracy, it may be deduced from the mode, method and manner by which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused themselves when such acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, prosecution eyewitnesses Barsaga and Fabricante testified that they saw appellants help each other in attacking the victim.

As noted by the Solicitor General, not one of the three appellants prevented the attack on the victim nor did any of them do anything to discontinue the commission of the crime. The trial court also noted that prior to the incident, appellants admitted that they were together inside the store of Ester Nicolas. Considering these circumstances, the trial court correctly ruled that there was conspiracy among the appellants. Where conspiracy is established, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> All the conspirators are liable as co-principals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Appellants further contend that the testimonies of Requinta and Seguenza that they saw Aliben carrying a bloodstained bolo was contrary to human experience. The normal actuation of an assailant, they argue, is to hide his weapon and not brandish the same before the public.

The trial court held that it was impossible to believe that while they were at the store, they had no knowledge of what was going on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Appellants Diosdado Nicolas and Bonifacio Aliben failed to satisfy the requirement of alibi that it was physically impossible for them to be present at the scene of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<br><br>Furthermore, it is well settled that positive identification, where categorical and consistent and not attended by any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitnesses testifying on the matter, prevails over alibi and denial which, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are negative and self-serving evidence undeserving weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Hence, the defense of denial and alibi cannot prosper in the light of the positive identification by eyewitnesses Ramon Barsaga and Floserfida Fabricante that appellants were the perpetrators of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><br><center><i>Taking advantage of superior strength</i><br></center><br>We agree with the trial court that the killing was attended by the aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength which was alleged in the Information. Superiority in number does not necessarily amount to the aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> It is necessary to show that the aggressors cooperated in such a way as to secure advantage from their superiority in strength.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> There must be proof of the relative physical strength of the aggressors and the assaulted party or proof that the accused simultaneously assaulted the deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> The circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength depends on the age, size and strength of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> It is considered whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assessing a superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor which is selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly ruled that taking advantage of superior strength was present, thus:<br><blockquote> In the instant case, the 3 accused were all armed. Ronnie Nicolas and Diodado Nicolas were armed with a piece of wood while Bonifacio Aliben was armed with a bolo and they helped one another in assaulting the victim who was alone. Furthermore, the victim at the time of his death was 52 years old while appellant Ronnie Nicolas at the time of the incident was 23 years old; Diosdado Nicolas was 29 years old and Bonifacio Aliben was 41 years old. There is a wide gap of the age between the victim and the accused, showing that the victim was much older than the three (3) accused who are younger and physically stronger.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br></blockquote>The attendant circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength qualifies the killing to murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:<br><blockquote> ART. 248. <i>Murder.</i>-- Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua to death, if committed with any of the following circumstances: <ol><li>With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity. x x x<br></li></ol></blockquote><center><i>The Penalty</i><br></center><br>Murder is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. The voluntary surrender of Ronnie Nicolas to the barangay captain immediately after the incident is a mitigating circumstance. Under Article 63 (3) of the Revised Penal Code, when the commission of the act is attended by some mitigating circumstances and there is no aggravating circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be applied. On the other hand, no mitigating or aggravating circumstance may be considered against appellants Bonifacio Aliben and Diosdado Nicolas. Under Article 63 (2) of the Revised Penal Code, when there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br><br>Hence, the trial court correctly imposed upon the appellants the lesser penalty for the offense, which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><center><i>Damages</i><br></center><br>The trial court correctly awarded to the heirs of the victim actual damages in the amount of Eighteen Thousand Nine Hundred Eighteen Pesos and Five Centavos (P18,918.05), which was supported by receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup><br><br>The trial court also correctly awarded to the heirs of the victim civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00, which needs no proof other than that of the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br>Finally, the trial court correctly awarded moral damages to the heirs of the victim as the victim’s wife testified that she suffered mental anguish as a result of her husband’s death. However, the amount of P30,000.00 it awarded should be increased to P50,000.00, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> An award of P25,000.00 for exemplary damages should also be added.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 63, Calabanga, Camarines Sur, in Criminal Case No. RTC ‘98-236 (Cal), finding appellants Ronnie Nicolas, Diosdado Nicolas and Bonifacio Aliben <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.
