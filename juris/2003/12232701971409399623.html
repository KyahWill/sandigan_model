Madera</b>, a <b>14 year old girl</b>, against her will and without her consent and of which carnal knowledge resulted in the pregnancy of the latter to her damage and prejudice in such amount as shall be proven in court.<br><br>Acts contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The prosecution established the following facts:<br><br>The victim, Jonalyn, the seventh of ten children of appellant and his wife Dominga Madera, was born on February 10, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At around 8:00 p.m. of May 8, 1998, the eve of the barangay fiesta at Dalipay, Milaor, Camarines Sur, appellant, after drinking liquor with his friends in the porch of his three-bedroom<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> house at said barangay, repaired to his bedroom. He thereupon summoned the then more than 13 years old Jonalyn, who obliged and went to his room upon which "he closed the door but there is a small opening."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On appellant's request, Jonalyn massaged him in the course of which he took off her shorts and panty, after which he also took off his shorts and brief, and laid down on top of her, spread her thighs and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She felt pain but was too afraid to complain or ask why he was doing that to her because he threatened to kill all of them in the family if she shouted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and she feared he would do it as he had often maltreated her and her siblings as well as her mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On June 1, 1998, at around 3:00 p.m., while Jonalyn's mother was in the fields and her brothers and sisters were playing at a chapel some 150 meters away from their house, appellant entered Jonalyn's room as she was about to sleep on a mat placed on the cemented floor.  Again appellant had sexual intercourse with Jonalyn,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> without her shouting for help because he told her that he would kill all of them if she shouted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>More than three months after the June 1, 1998 sexual intercourse, or on September 27, 1998, Jonalyn related to her sister Josephine the two sexual molestations committed on her by appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The following day or on September 28, 1998, Dr. Ma. Linda Llaguno, Municipal Health Officer of Milaor, Camarines Sur, examined Jonalyn and found her to be pregnant.<br><br>More than seven months after the sexual molestation committed on May 8, 1998, or on December 25<i>, </i>1998, Jonalyn gave birth to a baby girl.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Appellant, the sole witness for the defense, denied the charges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and gave the following version:<br><br>On May 8, 1998, he was cooking food for the fiesta to be celebrated on the next day. With him were his wife's relatives who were there for the next day's festivities. His older children Joseph, Jobert, Juvy and Jonalyn had gone to the dance hall, while his younger children stayed at home. He finished cooking at 10:00 p.m., and at around 10:30 p.m., he went with his brothers-in-law Dante and Roger to the dance hall but he did not see Jonalyn there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On June 1, 2002, he and his son Jobert harrowed the more than 2-hectare field of one Cipriano San Felipe, some 200 meters away from his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He started working at 8:00 a.m. and stopped at 4:00 p.m., and neither he nor his son went home for lunch as they partook of it at the house of Cipriano's son-in-law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> After working in the fields, he pastured his carabao and returned home only at 6:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>He did not know why his wife and Jonalyn, whom he suspected has a boyfriend named Boboy, would charge him with rape, except perhaps because he and his wife were always quarreling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The trial court, finding for the prosecution, convicted appellant of two counts of rape by the decision on review, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this court finds the accused ROBERTO MADERA y AGRAVANTE <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of the crime of <b>RAPE</b>, defined and penalized under Article 355<i> </i>of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act Nos. 7659 and 8353 in Criminal Cases Nos. 98-7309 and 98-7310 and hereby sentences the said accused to suffer the penalty of <b>DEATH</b> for each of the offense committed. Accused Roberto Madera y Agravante is hereby ordered to pay the victim Jonalyn Cadores Madera the amount of <u>P50,000.00 for each offense by way of moral damages</u> and to serve as a deterrent and warning to fathers who may have bestial desire against their daughter, said accused is also ordered to pay the sum of <u>P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.</u>  For having impregnated his own daughter resulting to giving birth to a child who is facing an unsecured future and for the traumatic experience suffered by the victim, the accused is further ordered to pay <u>P100,000.00 by way of consequential damages</u> and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>SO ORDERED. (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In his brief, appellant raises the following assigned errors, quoted <i>verbatim:</i><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO THE <u>INCREDIBLE, UNRELIABLE AND UNWORTHY</u> STANCE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT ANENT THE ALLEGED SEXUAL ACTS COMPLAINED OF<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN <u>NOT CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT PROSECUTION WITNESS DOMINGA MADERA WAS ACTUATED BY ILL WILL IN TESTIFYING AGAINST ACCUSED-APPELLANT</u><br><br><center>III</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN <u>NOT GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY ACCUSED-APPELLANT</u><br><br><center>IV</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF TWO (2) COUNTS OF RAPE DESPITE THE FACT THAT <u>HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</u><br></blockquote>The settled rule is that when the issue involves the credibility of a witness, the trial court's assessment is entitled to great weight, even finality, unless it is shown that it was tainted with arbitrariness or there was an oversight of some fact or circumstance of weight and influence. The reason is obvious - the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the witness firsthand and note his or her demeanor and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The trial court found Jonalyn a credible witness and appreciated her clear and convincing testimony on how the rapes were committed. Thus, after identifying her father in open court by pointing to him during which she was crying,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> she, a month and 14 years of age when she testified on March 4, 1999, declared as follows, quoted <i>verbatim:</i><br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Pros.

Lust is no respecter of time, place or kinship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Given the sound and the attention the television drew from the viewers, and the location of the door which was ajar, as reflected in Jonalyn's sketch - Exhibit "H"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which shows such door to be <u>along the same side where the television was mounted,</u> the viewers could not have been aware of, seen or sensed what was happening inside the room where the molestation took place.<br><br>Had the charge for the May 8, 1998 incident been concocted, Jonalyn could just have tailored her account by, e. g., omitting that portion of her testimony regarding the presence of family members at the time of the incident and about the door being left ajar. Or she could have inputed some details that could render her account more in accordance with common experience, like appellant kissing her on parts of her body before having an intercourse.

For given that distance between the place where he was, and the scene of the crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it was not physically impossible for him to be at the latter. That neither his son nor farm owner San Felipe came forward to corroborate his alibi all the more renders his alibi weak.<br><br>While, as reflected in Jonalyn's testimony she offered no physical resistance nor attempted to shout, she explained that she was intimidated and threatened into silence, appellant having readily instilled fear in her when he threatened "that all of us would be killed" if she shouted.<br><br>Intimidation must be viewed in light of the victim's perception and judgment at the time of the commission of the crime and not by any hard and fast rule.
