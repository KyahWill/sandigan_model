				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us for automatic review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the consolidated decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of 24 June 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 13, Ligao, Albay, in Criminal Cases Nos. 3680-3687, finding appellant Nelson Esperanza guilty beyond reasonable doubt of eight counts of rape committed against his 12-year-old niece Irma P. Esperanza and sentencing him in each count to suffer the penalty of <i>death</i> and to pay the amount of P50,000 for the "civil aspect" of the case.<br><br>The information in Criminal Case No. 3680<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> alleges that Nelson committed the crime of rape as follows:<br><blockquote>That on June 16, 1997, at about 4:00 o'clock in the morning, at Brgy. Balinad, Municipality of Polangui, Province of Albay, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, thru force and intimidation, and with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with his niece, IRMA P. ESPERANZA, who is of tender age, she being only 13-years old, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>ALL ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>The accusatory portions in the informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 3681,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 3682,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 3683,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 3684,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 3685,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 3686,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and 3687<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> are similarly worded as that in Criminal Case No. 3680 except as to the dates of the commission of the rapes which are, respectively, (a) 17 June 1997; (b) 18 June 1997; (c) 19 June 1997; (d) 20 June 1997; (e) 21 June 1997; (f) 22 June 1997; and (g) 23 June 1997.<br><br>The informations were based on the complaint subscribed and sworn to by Irma and her father Avelino Esperanza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The cases were consolidated. After Nelson entered a plea of not guilty in each case during his arraignment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> joint trial ensued. <br><br>The witnesses presented by the prosecution were Irma, Mary Jeynor Martinez, Teodora S. Salcedo, Ruben Brondial, Dr. Vivian Bustamante, and Avelino Esperanza.<br><br>Irma testified that she was born on 29 November 1985 to spouses Avelino Esperanza and Susan Pelonia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> When her parents separated, she was entrusted to appellant Nelson, Avelino's full-blood brother, so that Irma could continue her studies at the Balinad Elementary School.&nbsp; Irma started living with appellant's family at <i>Barangay</i> Balinad, Polangui, Albay, on 2 June 1997.&nbsp; She slept at the only bedroom of the house with Jenelle, Nelson's only child; while Nelson and his wife Gina slept at the sala.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <br><br>On 14 June 1997, Gina left for Manila to attend to some business.&nbsp; After Gina left, Irma observed that although Nelson slept in the sala when she and Jenelle were about to sleep, she would later found him sleeping between her and Jenelle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <br><br>At about 4:00 a.m. of 16 June 1997, Irma was awakened by the feeling that her breasts were being mashed and that something was being inserted into her vagina. Irma recognized that it was Nelson who was inserting his finger into her vagina.&nbsp; Irma struggled, removed his hands, and turned her back against Nelson.&nbsp; Nelson, however, turned her back to her original position.&nbsp; He then laid on top of her, undressed her, and forcefully inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; Blood oozed from her private part.&nbsp; Nelson warned her not to tell anybody; otherwise, he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>For seven successive days thereafter, or from 17 to 23 June 1997, at almost the same time, 4:00 a.m., Irma was awakened by Nelson's sexual advances, which culminated in sexual intercourse.&nbsp; In all those times, Irma could feel burning pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>It was only on 24 June 1997, when Gina arrived from Manila, that Irma found the courage to leave Nelson's house.&nbsp; Gina asked Irma why she was leaving.&nbsp; With Nelson's threat etched on her mind, Irma feigned the reason that she no longer wanted to go to school. Gina accompanied Irma to the house of Irma's father in San Agustin, Libon, Albay.&nbsp; Irma was unable to tell her father about Nelson's abuses.&nbsp; The next day, she left for Balinad at about 9:00 a.m. and stayed with her aunt Ester and continued her studies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Mary Jeynor Martinez, 12 years old, testified that she is Irma's friend and former classmate.&nbsp; Sometime in February 1998, Irma revealed to her that Nelson fondled her breast, touched and fingered her vagina, and raped her. She advised Irma to seek the assistance of their teacher Mrs. Teodora Salcedo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br>Teodora Sarcia Salcedo, Irma's teacher, testified that on 10 March 1998 she called Irma's attention regarding her failure to pay her graduation fees.&nbsp; On that occasion, Irma told her that she was no longer staying with Nelson, but with her aunt Ester, because Nelson had been holding her private parts and kissing her lips.&nbsp; Mrs. Salcedo got shocked.&nbsp; As it was almost lunchtime, Mrs. Salcedo put temporarily the matter aside and dismissed her class.&nbsp; After lunch, Irma narrated to Mrs. Salcedo, in the presence of her other teachers and classmates, her horrifying experience at the hands of Nelson.&nbsp; Mrs. Salcedo referred the matter to their Barangay Captain, Ruben Brondial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <br><br>Ruben Brondial testified that he came to know of the case of Irma when the latter, accompanied by Mrs. Salcedo, came to his office to report the abuses committed by Nelson against her. In the course of his investigation, he learned that Irma had been sexually abused by Nelson eight times. He then left for San Agustin, Libon, Albay, to inform Irma's father, Avelino, of what Nelson did to her.&nbsp; He and Avelino forthwith went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development and then to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <br><br>Avelino, father of Irma, testified that Nelson is his brother.&nbsp; He had entrusted the custody of Irma to Nelson.&nbsp; When he came to know of his brother's bestial acts through Irma's teacherÂ¸ he filed a complaint for rape.&nbsp; He felt deeply hurt and humiliated by Nelson's odious deed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Dr. Vivian Bustamante, the Municipal Health Officer of Polangui, Albay, who examined Irma on 16 March 1998, testified that she found in Irma's hymen old healed lacerations at 7 and 8 o'clock positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> She opined that those lacerations could have been caused by the insertion of a male organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <br><br>The first witness for the defense was Emeteria Esperanza, Nelson's mother.&nbsp; The announced purpose of her testimony was to establish that contrary to Irma's claim, it was Avelino who raped Irma.&nbsp; However, Emeteria had to be withdrawn from the witness stand during her open court testimony, as she could hardly speak and breathe. Emeteria was not recalled anymore to the witness stand.<br><br>For his part, Nelson denied the accusations against him, but admitted&nbsp; that sometime in the month of May 1997, Irma was entrusted to him by his brother Avelino.&nbsp; He accepted Irma because he thought that she could be a good companion of Jenelle, his only child.&nbsp; On 10 June 1997, he went to Barangay Bay, Ligao, Albay, to tend to his ducks.&nbsp; Barangay Bay could be reached from Barangay Banilad by a 45-minute bicycle ride.&nbsp; Irma was left to the care of either his wife Gina or his mother Emeteria.&nbsp; Whenever Gina would left for Manila,&nbsp; Nelson would fetch Emeteria to watch over Jenelle and Irma.&nbsp; Nelson pointed to the ongoing rift between his wife Gina and his sister Ester as the motive for the filing of the instant cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Testifying on rebuttal, Irma branded as a lie Nelson's claim that he was at Barangay Bay, Ligao, Albay, from 16 to 23 June 1997&nbsp; tending his ducks.&nbsp; His ducks were raised at a nearby ricefield in Balinad about twelve meters away from his house.&nbsp; She likewise refuted his claim that he never molested her and that Emeteria stayed with them at his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The trial court gave full faith and credence to Irma's testimony.&nbsp; It declared that Irma's inability to prevent the appellant from committing the crime by shouting or forcibly resisting could not be taken against her.&nbsp; Nelson, being her uncle, definitely exercised moral and physical ascendancy over her, which could be sufficient to cow her into submission to his bestial desire.&nbsp; It disregarded Nelson's defense of denial and alibi not only for being self-serving, but also for lack of proof of physical impossibility for him to be at the <i>locus criminis </i>at the time of its commission.&nbsp; It then convicted Nelson of eight counts of rape and imposed upon him the death penalty for each count, considering the relationship of Nelson as uncle within the third civil degree of consanguinity and the fact that Irma was only 12 years old at the time the rapes were committed. &nbsp;<br><br>In his Appellant's Brief, Nelson attributes to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE OBVIOUSLY REHEARSED AND EQUALLY INCONSISTENT TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT ANENT THE CRIMES CHARGED.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF EIGHT (8) COUNTS OF RAPE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>III</center><br>&nbsp;ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING HIM LIABLE FOR THE LESSER OFFENSE OF ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>ON THE ASSUMPTION FURTHER THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY AS CHARGED, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT IMPOSING UPON HIM THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA IN CRIMINAL CASE NOS. 3680 TO 3687.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>In support thereof, Nelson argues that Irma's testimony should not be given weight for being obviously rehearsed, as shown by her identical answers as to the time, place, and manner the rapes were committed.&nbsp; He also asserts that Irma's testimony bore several inconsistencies.&nbsp; Irma flip-flopped as to (a) when she left his house; (b) whether he raped her on 17 June 1997; and (c) whether he did insert his penis into her, considering her admission that the room was dimly lit and he had previously inserted his finger into her private part.<br><br>Finally, Nelson asserts that granting without admitting that he did commit the alleged rapes, the trial court erred in imposing the supreme penalty of death. While the informations alleged that Irma was 13 years old at the time the rapes were committed, they did not allege that Nelson is a relative of Irma within the third civil degree of consanguinity.&nbsp; With this infirmity, Nelson should have been meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. <br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) maintains that the trial court did not err in giving credence to the testimony of Irma.&nbsp; Her testimony established beyond reasonable doubt that from 16 to 23 June 1997, Nelson, her paternal uncle, had carnal knowledge of her.&nbsp; As for the identical manner of the commission of the eight counts of rape, the OSG argues that a series of rapes committed in almost the same manner is nothing extraordinary and does not necessarily render the complainant's testimony incredible.&nbsp; The OSG further argues that the lapses in the testimony of Irma were inconsequential and do not affect her credibility. &nbsp;<br><br>The OSG adds that the alibi posed by Nelson cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of Irma, who had no ill-motive against him.&nbsp; Moreover, Nelson did not prove that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission. &nbsp;<br><br>As to the penalty, the OSG maintains that the trial court correctly imposed the death penalty. All the eight informations contain the description that Nelson is Irma's paternal uncle.&nbsp; However, the OSG prays that the indemnity be increased from P50,000 to P75,000 in line with prevailing jurisprudence and that Nelson be ordered to pay for each&nbsp; count of rape moral damages of P50,000 and exemplary damages of P25,000. <br><br>We affirm Nelson's conviction.<br><br>Time and again we have held that the factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of witnesses, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> This rule, however, admits of exceptions such as where there exists a fact or circumstance of weight and influence which has been ignored or misconstrued by the court, or where the trial court has acted arbitrarily in its appreciation of the facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the cases at bar, we give full weight to the trial court's finding that Irma was sexually ravished by Nelson.&nbsp; This Court, however, finds that the prosecution was able to prove only seven counts of rape: <br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><b>1.

In the cases at bar, considering the age of the victim, it is unlikely that her narration is merely the product of a scheming and malicious mind.&nbsp; No woman would openly admit that she was raped and consequently subject herself to an examination of her private parts, undergo the trauma and humiliation of a public trial, and embarrass herself with the need to narrate in detail how she was raped, if she was not raped at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This ruling especially holds true where the complainant is a minor, whose testimony deserves full credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> And such credibility is definitely enhanced when the accusing words, as in the instant cases, are directed against a close relative, like an uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It is thus unthinkable, if not completely preposterous, for Irma to falsely accuse her own uncle in wanton disregard of the unspeakable trauma and social stigma it may generate on her and the entire family.&nbsp;

The absence of any detail on how the crime of rape was committed bars conviction for such crime. Thus, in the absence of any evidence showing that Nelson had carnal knowledge of Irma, aside from his mashing of Irma's breasts and vagina, the crime committed is merely acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, which reads:<br><blockquote>Article 336. <i>Acts of lasciviousness</i> â Any person who shall commit any act of lasciviousness upon other persons of either sex under any of the circumstances mentioned in the preceding article shall be punished by <i>prision correccional</i>.</blockquote> Nelson could be convicted of acts of lasciviousness because the latter is necessarily included in the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Section 4, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <i>Judgment in case of variance between allegation and proof</i>. â When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information, and that proved or established by the evidence, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved included in that which is charged, or of the offense charged included in that which is proved.</blockquote>The inconsistencies in the testimony of Irma pointed out by Nelson are inconsequential. Minor lapses in the memory of a rape victim can be expected. It is an understandable human frailty not to be able to recount with facility all the details of a dreadful and harrowing experience. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, the failure of Irma to respond properly to some questions propounded to her does not put to naught her reliability and sincerity. &nbsp;<br><br>We cannot yield to the contention of Nelson that the darkness of the room made it impossible for Irma to declare with certainty that sexual intercourse took place, as she could not have been sure that it was his penis that penetrated her and not his finger. Irma categorically declared that Nelson inserted his penis after he inserted his finger into her vagina. &nbsp;<br><br>The imputation by Nelson of ill-motive on Ester hardly merits consideration.&nbsp; It is difficult to accept his claim that Ester manipulated Irma into filing the present case because of the on-going rift between her and Gina.&nbsp; No member of a rape victim's family would dare encourage the victim to publicly expose the dishonor of the family, more specifically if such accusation is against a member of the family, unless the crime was in fact committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <br><br>In light of the positive testimony of Irma showing beyond doubt Nelson's accountability, the latter's bare denial and alibi must fail.&nbsp; As between a categorical testimony that rings of truth on one hand, and a bare denial on the other, the former is generally held to prevail. A mere denial, like alibi, is inherently a weak defense and constitutes self-serving negative evidence, which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <br><br>Having found that the appellant committed rape in Criminal Cases Nos. 3680 and 3682-3687, and acts of lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. 3681, we shall proceed to determine the penalties to be imposed on him.<br><br>With respect to Criminal Cases Nos. 3680 and 3682-3687, we cannot impose the penalty of death.&nbsp; Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, which is the law applicable in these cases, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the death penalty shall be imposed if the rape victim is under eighteen years of age and the offender is a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree. <br><br>Each of the informations charges Nelson with the crime of simple rape only because while it alleges that the victim was only 13 years of age at the time of the incident, there is no allegation that Nelson is her relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree.<br><br>The twin circumstances of minority and relationship under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, are in the nature of qualifying circumstances because they alter the nature of the crime of rape and increase the penalty.&nbsp; As special qualifying circumstances they must be specifically pleaded or alleged with certainty in the information; otherwise, the death penalty cannot be imposed.&nbsp; In these cases, the allegation that Irma is Nelson's niece is not specific enough to satisfy the special qualifying circumstance of relationship. If the offender is merely a relation - not a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, or common law spouse of the mother of the victim â the specific relationship must be alleged in the information, <i>i.e.</i>, that he is "a relative by consanguinity or affinity [as the case may be] within the third civil degree."&nbsp; The informations in these cases merely allege that Irma is the "niece" of Nelson.&nbsp; She could be a niece beyond the third civil degree either of consanguinity or affinity. Hence, the informations are fatally defective in this respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> <br><br>And even granting that the relationship within the third civil degree either of consanguinity or affinity was duly proved during the trial, still such proof cannot be appreciated against Nelson to justify the imposition of the death penalty because he would thereby be denied of his constitutional and statutory right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.&nbsp; Nelson cannot be charged with committing the crime of rape in its simple form and then be tried and convicted of rape in its qualified form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We also take note of the fact that while the informations allege that Irma was 13 years old at the time she was raped, her birth certificate reveals that she was only 11 years old at the time, having been born on 29 November 1985.&nbsp; Thus, these cases could have been cases of statutory rape.&nbsp; But, Nelson cannot be convicted of statutory rapes. In <i>People vs. Moreno</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> reiterated in <i>People v. Capinpin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we ruled that an accused cannot be convicted under paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code in an information charging him with rape under paragraph 1 (by using force or intimidation) because none of these modes of committing rape (i.e., when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the woman is under twelve years of age) were alleged in the information.&nbsp; The rationale for this rule is that "[t]o convict him under either of these statutory provisions is to deprive him of the constitutional right to be informed of the accusation against him." Section 14 (2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused...shall enjoy the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him." &nbsp;<br><br>However, conformably with <i>People v. Bayya</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and <i>People v. EscaÃÅo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> we may appreciate as an aggravating circumstance the victim's minority, which was&nbsp; pleaded in the informations and proved by her birth certificate. In those cases, we held that when either one of the twin special qualifying circumstances of relationship and minority is omitted or lacking, that which is pleaded in the information and proved by the evidence, like the complainant's minority in these cases, may be considered as an aggravating circumstance. Nonetheless, the presence of an aggravating circumstance cannot serve to raise the penalty to be imposed on Nelson. Since simple rape is punishable by the single indivisible penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, that penalty shall, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, be imposed regardless of any modifying circumstance that might have attended the commission of the crime. <br><br>For the crime of acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code, Nelson may be sentenced to suffer <i>prision correccional</i> in its medium period, there being no modifying circumstance that attended the commission thereof.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he may be meted an indeterminate penalty of three months of arresto mayor as minimum to three years of <i>prision correccional</i> as maximum.<br><br>On the civil liability of Nelson, we note that the trial court merely ordered the payment of civil indemnity in the sum of P50,000 in each case.&nbsp; It failed to award moral damages, which is mandatory upon a finding of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, consistent with the current case law, moral damages in the amount of P50,000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> is awarded in Criminal Cases Nos. 3680 and 3682-3687. Likewise, moral damages in the amount of P30,000 is proper in Criminal Case No. 3681 pursuant to Article 2219 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; In view of the presence of one aggravating circumstance, we award exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000 for each count of rape in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Ligao, Albay, Branch 13, in Criminal Cases Nos. 3680-3687, inclusive, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATIONS</b>. <br><br>In Criminal Cases Nos. 3680 and 3682-3687, appellant NELSON ESPERANZA is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of simple rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in each case.&nbsp; He is also ordered in each case to pay the victim Irma P.
