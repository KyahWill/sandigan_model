R. No. 122841.<br><br>By Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of December 13, 1995, the Third Division of this Court referred G. R. No. 122841 to the Court of Appeals, following the case of <i>Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><i> </i>holding that decisions or awards of a voluntary arbitrator or panel of arbitrators in labor cases are reviewable by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, finding that the option of petitioner not to subject the dispute to the grievance machinery provided for in the CBA was tantamount to relinquishing her right to avail of the aid of a voluntary arbitrator in settling the dispute which "likewise converted an unresolved grievance into a resolved one," held that the voluntary arbitrator did not have jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint and accordingly nullified and set aside, by Decision of October 30, 1998, the voluntary arbitration award.<br><br>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the Court of Appeals Decision having been denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of February 26, 1999, the present petition was filed which raises the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol>1. Whether or not the Voluntary Arbitrator had jurisdiction over petitioner's complaint, and<br><br>2. Whether or not respondents are guilty of estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></ol></blockquote>Petitioner, citing Article 262 of the Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended which reads:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 262.&nbsp; JURISDICTION OVER OTHER LABOR DISPUTES.&nbsp; The Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, <b><u>upon agreement of the parties, shall hear and decide all other labor disputes</u></b> including unfair labor practices and bargaining deadlocks.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),</blockquote>contends that her option not to subject the dispute to the grievance machinery of RPN did not amount to her relinquishing of her right to avail of voluntary arbitration as a mode of settling it for she and respondents in fact agreed to have the dispute settled by a voluntary arbitrator when they freely executed the above-said Submission Agreement.&nbsp; She thus concludes that the voluntary arbitrator has jurisdiction over the controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner contends in any event that even assuming that the voluntary arbitrator had no jurisdiction over the case, it would not be in keeping with settled jurisprudence to allow a losing party to question the authority of the voluntary arbitrator after it had freely submitted itself to its authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>The above-quoted Article 262 of the Labor Code provides that <b>upon agreement of the parties</b>, the voluntary arbitrator can hear and decide all other labor disputes.<br><br>Contrary to the finding of the Court of Appeals, voluntary arbitration as a mode of settling the dispute <b>was not forced upon respondents</b>. Both parties indeed agreed to submit the issue of validity of the dismissal of petitioner to the jurisdiction of the voluntary arbitrator by the Submission Agreement duly signed by their respective counsels.<br><br>As the voluntary arbitrator had jurisdiction over the parties' controversy, discussion of the second issue is no longer necessary.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals Decision of October 30, 1998 is hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b> and the voluntary arbitration Award of October 18, 1995 is hereby <b>REINSTATED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, Acting C.J., (Chairman)</i>, and <i>Panganiban, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Corona, JJ</i>., on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 169-180.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 190.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 73.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 74-77.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 103-117.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 81-98.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 25-31.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 151-152.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id. </i>at 153.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> G.
