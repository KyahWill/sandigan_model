				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 66, Makati City, finding appellant Arturo Nicolas y Ringor guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder for the killing of Delbie Bermejo (the victim) and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the heirs of the victim the amount of P127,500.00 as liquidated damages and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>In an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated January 5, 1998, appellant was indicted as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 1<sup>st</sup> day of January, 1998, in the City of Makati, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a gun, with intent to kill and by means of treachery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot one DELBIE BERMEJO y VELASCO hitting him on his neck and breast, thereby inflicting serious and mortal wounds upon the latter which directly caused his death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>Upon arraignment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on February 5, 1998, appellant, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of not guilty. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>Culled from the records of the case are the following facts established by the prosecution:<br><br>On January 1, 1998, at about 1:30 a.m., the victim, his two children Ruby and Rodel and nephew Ariel Bermejo were walking along a small alley in Makati City after attending a New Year’s party at a relative’s house. Behind them was appellant Arturo Nicolas, a dismissed Army Sergeant, who greeted the victim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and his nephew Ariel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The victim, in turn, greeted appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Suddenly, a gunshot was heard by the victim’s companions and on turning around to see what had happened, they saw him falling to the ground as appellant was pointing a gun at him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Terrified at what she saw, Ruby ran and went home to engage the help of others to aid her in bringing her father to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In the meantime, as Ariel remained where he was, he saw appellant shoot the victim, prompting him to run and report the incident to a relative, Ernesto Suante.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The victim was brought to the Makati Medical Center where he was pronounced dead on arrival.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The postmortem examination conducted by Dr. Tomas Suguitan of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory, Medico Legal Division, in Camp Crame, Quezon City showed that the victim sustained two gunshot wounds, one at the left side of his nape and the other at the left side of his chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It also showed that he had four abrasions on his knees, forehead and shoulder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which Dr. Suguitan surmised were caused by the victim’s fall when he was shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The doctor concluded that the cause of the victim’s death was hemorrhage as a result of gunshot wounds of his neck and trunk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Finding for the prosecution, the trial court found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder by Decision of February 10, 1999, the dispositive portion of which is quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Arturo Nicolas y Ringor guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder with the qualifying circumstance of treachery and the Court hereby sentences him to suffer, taking into consideration the absence of aggravating and mitigating circumstance, the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the heirs of Delbie Bermejo the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages and the sum of P127,500.00 as liquidated damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal anchored on the following assigned errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE ACCUSED IS [NOT] ENTITLED TO AN ACQUITTAL BASED ON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:<br><ol type="1"><br><li> NO MOTIVE FOR THE KILLING WAS ESTABLISHED;<br></li><li> THE GUN WHERE THE BULLETS WERE FIRED WAS NOT RECOVERED NOR PRESENTED;<br></li><li> THE BALLISTIC REPORT ON THE THIRD SNUG (sic) ALLEGEDLY SURRENDERED BY THE ACCUSED WAS NOT PRESENTED;<br></li><li> THE RESULT OF THE PARAFFIN TEST CONDUCTED ON THE ACCUSED WAS NOT PRESENTED.<br></li></ol><br></li><li> THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT ACCUSED WAS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Appellant argues that as the prosecution failed to establish any motive for the killing of the victim with whom he was not acquainted, he had no reason for killing him. He also argues that the failure of the prosecution to present any witness who could testify that he owned a .9 mm pistol, the type of firearm from which the slugs recovered from the crime scene were fired, infirms the evidence against him as does the failure to recover or present to the court the gun used in the perpetration of the crime.<br><br>Appellant then zeroes in on the failure of the prosecution to present the ballistic examination report on the empty shell of a .9 mm pistol forwarded to the Crime Laboratory which SPO2 Nestor Valenzuela claimed in the Final Investigation Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> was surrendered by him (appellant). To appellant, such failure likewise infirms the evidence for the prosecution.<br><br>Finally, appellant asserts that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are replete with inconsistencies which warrant his acquittal.<br><br>Upon the other hand, appellant harps on alibi to exculpate him from any liability, he claiming that at the time of the incident, he was at home celebrating the New Year with his wife and three children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The appeal is bereft of merit.<br><br>Appellant was positively identified as <b>the</b> assailant by two credible eyewitnesses.

In fact, relationship could even strengthen the witnesses’ credibility, it being unnatural for aggrieved relatives to falsely accuse someone other than the actual culprit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> for their natural interest in securing the conviction of the guilty would deter them from implicating any other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>As for the prosecution’s failure to prove appellant’s motive for the killing, motive is not an element of the crime of murder, hence, it does not have to be proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It becomes material only when the evidence is circumstantial or inconclusive, and there is doubt whether a crime has been committed or whether the accused has committed it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Ample direct evidence having been presented through the testimonies of Ruby and Ariel who identified appellant as the perpetrator, appellant’s motive is immaterial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>With respect to the instrument used in the killing of the victim, its presentation is not indispensable in the prosecution of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The weapon used in the killing, after all, is also not an element of the crime of murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thus, this Court held in <i>People v. Bello</i>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><blockquote>For purposes of conviction, it is enough that the prosecution establishes by proof beyond reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and the accused is the author thereof. <u>The production of the weapon used in the commission of the crime is not a condition <i>sine qua non</i> for the discharge of such burden, for the same may not have been recovered at all from the assailant.</u> (Underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Neither is the presentation of a witness to testify that appellant owned or was in possession of a .9 mm pistol. Besides, it is not for the courts, much more the defense, to dictate what evidence to present or who should take the witness stand at the trial of a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As this Court held in <i>People v. Bulfango</i>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><blockquote>The prosecution has the exclusive prerogative to determine whom to present as witnesses. The prosecution need not present each and every witness but only as may be needed to meet the quantum of proof necessary to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br></blockquote>As for appellant’s insistence on his innocence in view of the absence of the results of the paraffin test he undertook, the same is unavailing. Suffice it to state that even negative findings of a paraffin test do not conclusively show that a person did not discharge a firearm at the time the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> For absence of nitrates is possible if a person discharged a firearm with gloves on, or if he thoroughly washed his hands thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Unavailing too is appellant’s argument that the presentation of the ballistic report on the third slug allegedly surrendered by him is “very vital for the Prosecution since if the Ballistic Report will show that this shell was fired from the same gun where the other slugs recovered came from, then there is a strong possibility that the accused was indeed the same person who killed the victim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> For, even without the ballistic report, the positive identification by prosecution witnesses Ariel and Ruby of appellant as the assailant is more than sufficient to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Appellant next focuses on the prosecution witnesses’ claim that the victim was twice shot from behind which is belied, so he claims, by the finding of Dr. Suguitan that <u>the point of entry of the second shot was at the victim’s left chest</u>. Appellant does not dispute, however, that <u>the point of entry of the first shot was at the left portion of the victim’s nape</u>. Given these, the plausible explanation is that the victim was initially shot from behind, hitting the left portion of his neck, after which he turned towards appellant at which instant he was shot again, this time hitting his chest. Appellant’s proposition that had the trial court not overlooked such “discrepancy,” his acquittal would have been in order does not thus lie.<br><br>The alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of Ariel with respect to the position of the victim when the second shot was fired are just minor and collateral matters which do not affect the substance, veracity or weight of the witness’ testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Appellant’s alibi thus fails vis-à-vis the positive and categorical assertion of prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It is worthless, considered with suspicion and always received with caution not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because it is easily fabricated and concocted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Being negative in nature and self-serving, it cannot secure worthiness more than that placed upon the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify on clear and positive evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In any event, for the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not enough to show that the accused was somewhere else when the crime was committed. He must further demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Appellant glaringly failed in this regard. As correctly found by the trial court, the evidence shows that the residence of the accused at 47 Gladiola Street, Zone 8, Barangay Rizal, Makati City, where he claimed to be with his family when the crime was perpetrated is only about 300 meters away from the <i>locus criminis</i> at Blueberry Street, Aranay Village, Barangay Rizal, Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As for the presence of treachery in the killing, the trial court correctly appreciated the same. The victim was caught defenseless when appellant suddenly shot him from behind as he was walking along an alley. The attack was so swift and unexpected that the victim who was unarmed could not have resisted. Whereas, on the other hand, appellant was not thereby exposed to any danger.<br><br>Appellant is thus guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. There being no other modifying circumstance, the lesser penalty shall be imposed, pursuant to Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>As to the civil aspect of the case, in line with prevailing jurisprudence, the award of indemnity to the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 is affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>As for the award of the amount of P127,500.00 as actual damages, the same appears to have been based on the claim of the victim’s sister Lilia Santilloza that the heirs incurred funeral, burial and miscellaneous expenses. She, however, merely presented two sheets of yellow pad containing a list<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the expenses allegedly incurred which cannot be considered as competent proof and cannot replace the probative value of official receipts to justify the award of actual damages. Article 2199 of the Civil Code explicitly requires that, except as provided by law or stipulation, one is entitled to an adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss suffered by him as he has duly proved. Only substantiated and proven expenses, or those that appear to have been genuinely incurred in connection with the death, wake or burial of the victim will be recognized in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The award of actual damages is thus deleted for lack of factual and legal basis. Nonetheless, accused-appellant should pay the heirs of the victim temperate damages under Article 2224 of the Civil Code in the amount of P10,000.00.<br><br>The award of moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Additionally, given the attendance of the qualifying circumstance of treachery, the award to the heirs of the victim exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> in accordance with Article 2230 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 66, finding appellant <b>ARTURO NICOLAS y RINGOR</b> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder is hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b> The civil aspect of the case is <b>MODIFIED</b> to read: Accused-appellant is hereby ORDERED to pay the heirs of Delbie Bermejo the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for his death, P10,000.00 as temperate damages, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>Costs against appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Panganiban, Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Corona, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 15-18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Records at 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1998 at 40.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Records at 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1998 at 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 25 and 40.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 41.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Records at 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1998 at 12-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 18.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Records at 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 3-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Exhibit “I”, Records at 60-61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> TSN, November 12, 1998 at 6-7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1998 at 24-29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 37-41.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> TSN, November 12, 1998 at 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>People v.
