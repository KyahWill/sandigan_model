Nineteen witnesses were presented by the prosecution.<br><br>Witness Nelson Nialla ("Nialla"), the security guard on duty at Victoria's Supermart, narrated that on May 28, 1993, at about 11:00 in the morning, accused-appellants, along with several others, barged into the supermarket and announced a hold-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Accused Jorge Bolinget slipped behind cashier Gemma Gabuat, poked a gun at her right side, ordered her to open the cash register and scooped all the money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> His testimony was corroborated by Carina Sernadilla, the cashier manning the counter beside Gemma's.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Nialla also testified that the appellants, Paleyan and Domacyong, pointed their guns at him and ordered him to squat. Paleyan fired at the display and then took the money from the cash registers, while Domacyong entered the room of Tony Ang ("Ang"), the store owner. Nialla also noticed a man in civilian clothes outside the supermarket.&nbsp; He was peeping inside the supermarket and was in the act of drawing something from his front waistline.&nbsp; At about the same time that the malefactors exited the building, he heard a gunshot and saw the man in civilian clothes fall to the ground.&nbsp; He also saw a man being lifted to a taxi. Later, he learned that two persons, both CIS members, died as a result of the robbery.&nbsp; The two were Cesar Reyes and Nestor Visitacion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Albert Lorenzana testified that he was a bagger at Victoria's Supermart.&nbsp; During the incident, he was at the bodega to get some goods.&nbsp; Returning to the supermarket, he met the appellant Domacyong, carrying a black bag on his shoulder on his way to Ang's office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He heard someone shout "hold-up." He turned his head towards the voice and saw accused Bolinget pointing a gun at cashier Gemma Gabuat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Bolinget then took the money from the cash register.<br><br>Tony Ang, Victoria's Supermart owner, testified that he was inside his office attending to a customer when a man barged in, and at gunpoint, announced a hold-up. He was ordered not to look up and to hand over the money. The gunman placed the money inside a bag and rushed outside. The money totaled&nbsp; P140,000.00, more or less.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Chief Inspector Avelino Edralin ("Inspector Edralin"), then the Assistant Chief of Police of Baguio, heard at their radio room one of their policemen asking for help as there was an on-going robbery at Session Road. Together with SPO1 Leonardo Gomez, he boarded their mobile car and drove to Session Road. Taking Calderon Street, they passed by SPO1 Hidalgo and told him to join them in the mobile. They saw appellant Domacyong running with a gun at Kisad Road. Inspector Edralin shouted at the man to stop and raise his hands. He and SPO1 Juanito Kimay ("SPO1 Kimay") approached Domacyong, while Hidalgo and Gomez acted as back-ups. They arrested him, confiscated his gun and brought him to the police station. The gun was a .45 caliber pistol<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> without a magazine but with one live bullet inside the chamber.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Kimay testified that at the time of the incident, he was shopping with his wife at 456 Department Store along Session Road. Hearing gunshots, he went out of the store and met SPO1 Reynaldo Soria ("SPO1 Soria"). SPO1 Soria told him there was a robbery and the robbers were escaping towards Calderon Street on board a taxi. They exchanged fire with the robbers and tailed their taxicab towards Harrison Road. Due to heavy traffic near Land Bank, the robbers alighted from their taxicab and scurried in different directions towards Burnham Park. Kimay followed one of them up to Kisad Road near Cholo's Restaurant. While he was approaching the man, Inspector Edralin arrived together with Gomez and Hidalgo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They arrested the man who turned out to be appellant Domacyong.&nbsp; They confiscated his firearm, a .45 caliber pistol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Soria and SPO1 Federico Leyba testified that at the time of the robbery, they were routing traffic at the intersection of Harrison Road and Magsaysay Avenue. They received a radio message about a robbery at Victoria's Supermart. They drove their motorcycles to the supermarket.&nbsp; At the Mabini and Session Road intersection, they encountered the robbers who fired at them. They got off their motorcycles and gave chase to one of the suspects on foot.&nbsp; They caught up with the suspect and arrested him at the Burnham Lake Drive.&nbsp; The suspect is accused Bolinget.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> They confiscated from him a .38 caliber revolver<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and some money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>SPO2 Rey Ekid, a member of the Baguio Police Station, narrated how he assisted in pursuing the robbers of Victoria's Supermart. He boarded their mobile car together with Sgt. Ruben Gomez and PO1 Eduardo Cocal and rushed to the place. Upon learning that the armed robbers fled towards Burnham Park, he and PO1 Copal alighted from their mobile and walked until they reached Cholo's Restaurant along Kisad Road. They saw four persons scaling the walls of the Athletic Bowl, and fired warning shots.&nbsp; The men did not stop and upon reaching the other side of the wall, scampered in different directions.&nbsp; One of them ran to the middle of the Athletic Bowl and Ekid was able to arrest him. He identified him as appellant Paleyan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Appellant Paleyan surrendered a .45 cal. firearm<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which he threw to the ground in the course of his arrest.<br><br>Inspector Oasan, then the Chief of the Investigation Section of the Baguio City Police Station, likewise testified about his role in the Victoria's Supermart robbery. Upon knowing of the incident, he summoned Sgt. Elmer Cruz and PO3 Romeo Agngaray and proceeded to the place on board Cruz' private car.&nbsp; Along the way, they were informed that the robbers fled to Burnham Park. Oasan alighted and went on foot towards Mabini Street while his companions proceeded by car towards Calderon Street. Upon reaching Burnham Lake Drive, he met several policemen, including SPO1 Leyba, who had arrested a person who was turned over to him.&nbsp; He identified the person as accused Bolinget.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> SPO1 Leyba and SPO1 Soria also handed to him some money which they recovered from Bolinget.&nbsp; They executed a joint affidavit on the turn-over of the cash amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Oasan then returned the money amounting to P16,460.50 to Ang, the owner of Victoria's Supermart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Inspector Oasan also testified that SPO1 Ekid turned over a firearm of .45 cal. to him along with a magazine containing five (5) ammunitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He likewise received a .38 cal. revolver from Mr. Rabang, the security officer of Burnham Park.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Lilian Lauron, Records Officer III of the Records Legal &amp; Research Branch, Firearms and Explosives Office of Camp Crame, and SPO3 Elpidio Agngarayngay, records verifier of the Records Branch of Camp Crame's Firearms and Explosives Office, also took the witness stand.

Roque, Senior Inspector of the PNP and Chief, Records Br., FEO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>A forensic chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation, Maria Carina Madrigal-Javier, testified that she conducted a chemistry examination on the paraffin cast done by their laboratory technician on the hands of appellants Domacyong and Paleyan and accused Bolinget. The results of her tests showed the presence of nitrates on the hands of accused Bolinget<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and appellant Domacyong,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> but none on the hands of appellant Paleyan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Dr. Jose Bugayong, Jr. conducted the medical examination of Cesar Reyes ("Reyes") at the St. Louis University Hospital.&nbsp; He testified that Reyes was still conscious but bleeding profusely from sustained gunshot wounds which affected his vital organs at the time he was brought to the hospital.&nbsp; He operated on the victim with the help of Senior Resident, Dr. Paul Etiket. Unfortunately, Reyes died after twenty hours due to massive and extensive bleeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Dr. Tedler Depaynos examined Nestor Sabandal Visitacion at the St. Louis University Hospital.&nbsp; He testified that the gunshot wound sustained by Visitacion was fatal as it damaged his vital organs.&nbsp; He died after three days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> executed by appellant Domacyong and accused Rey Buyagan were identified in court by NBI agent George Jularbal.

He was treated at the Baguio General Hospital for his injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Imelda Reyes testified on the funeral expenses they incurred in the amount of P32,579.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> She likewise declared that they spent P17,300.00 as hospitalization expenses.&nbsp; The expenses were not contested by the defense.<br><br>The accused waived presentation of evidence in their behalf and manifested that they were submitting the case for decision. They were convicted by the trial court in a Judgment, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered as follows:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 11445-R</u><br></div><br>The court finds the accused Esteban Domacyong y Paksay guilty of illegal possession of a .45 caliber pistol; applying R.A. 8294 which amended PD 1866, sentences him to 7 years 4 months and 1 day of prision mayor to 8 years of prision mayor and to pay a fine of P30,000.00.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 11446-R</u><br></div><br>The court finds the accused Erick Lumas-e y Kimongo (Richard Paleyan) guilty of illegal possession of 1 caliber .45 pistol with 6 live ammunition; applying R.A. 8294 which amended PD 1866, sentences him to 7 years 4 months and 1 day of prision mayor to 8 years of prision mayor and to pay a fine of P30,000.00.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 11443-R</u><br></div><br>The court acquits Rey Buyagan y Geneyen and Francis Kilongan for insufficiency of evidence, but finds the accused George "Jorge" Bolinget y Bagtang, Esteban Domacyong y Paksay and Richard Paleyan (aka Erick Lumas-e) y Kimongo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide as penalized in paragraph 1, Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code aggravated by use of unlicensed firearms (<i>sic</i>), hereby sentences George "Jorge" Bolinget, Esteban Domacyong and Richard Paleyan (aka Erick Lumas-e) to Reclusion Perpetua and to pay jointly and severally the:<br><blockquote> Heirs of Cesar Reyes the amount of P50,000.00 by way of indemnification for his death; P72,599.00 for hospitalization and funeral expenses; P200,000.00 by way of moral damages;<br><br>Heirs of Nestor Visitacion the amount of P50,000.00 by way of indemnification for his death; P88,096.65 for actual expenses; P200,000.00 by way of moral damages;<br><br>Domingo Santiago the amount of P1,000.00 for actual expenses.<br></blockquote>and to pay costs.<br><br>Let a warrant of arrest issue for George "Jorge" Bolinget, who had escaped from detention, for the service of his sentence as hereinbefore set forth.<br><br>Send the records of Criminal Case No. 11443-R to the Archives pending the apprehension of accused Bong Patas, Thompson Gadgadan, Daniel Licdeman, Gerry Baloyo, and Sicnud (FNU), for whom a warrant of arrest is ordered to issue.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>Appellants Domacyong and Paleyan raise in this appeal, the lone error that "the Regional Trial Court erred in finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of robbery with homicide without stating the facts and the law on which it was based. There were no clear and convincing evidence whatsoever to show and prove that the accused were the ones who were responsible for the death of the two persons when the alleged robbery was committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> They contend that there was no proof presented by the prosecution on the manner surrounding the death of, and the identity of, the person(s) who shot the victims during the robbery. They submit that the crime of homicide not having been proven, it cannot be complexed with robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>We uphold the ruling of the trial court.<br><br>Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><blockquote> ART. 294. <i>Robbery with violence or intimidation of persons – Penalties. – </i>Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or any person shall suffer: <ol> <li>The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death,<b> when by reason or on occasion of such robbery,</b> the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></li></ol><br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x. (<i>emphasis supplied</i>)<br></blockquote>The crime of robbery with homicide requires proof of the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking was done with <i>animo lucrandi</i>; and (4) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, homicide was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Well-entrenched in jurisprudence is the doctrine that when homicide takes place as a consequence or on the occasion of a robbery, all those who took part in the robbery are guilty as principals in the complex crime of robbery with homicide, even if they did not actually take part in the homicide. The exception is when it is clearly shown that the accused endeavored to prevent the unlawful killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the lack of direct evidence on how the homicides were committed matters little. The circumstantial evidence leaves scant doubt on the part and participation of the appellants.<br><br>Witness Nialla saw the victim Cesar Reyes, a CIS agent, standing outside the supermart while the robbery was ongoing. He was peeping inside the supermarket and his hand was holding something in his waist. After the robbery and while the malefactors were running out of the supermarket, Nialla heard a gunshot and saw Reyes slump to the ground.

The violation was also appreciated by the trial court to aggravate their penalty in the crime of robbery with homicide. We note that counsel for appellants included in their notice of appeal their conviction for illegal possession of firearms. Nonetheless, said counsel did not assail the said judgment with any particular assignment of error.<br><br>Republic Act No. 8294 provides that "if homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We have consistently ruled that if an unlicensed firearm is used in the commission of any other crime, there can be no separate offense of simple illegal possession of firearms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, in <b>People vs. Ladjaalam,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote> . . . A simple reading thereof (R.A. No. 8294) shows that if an unlicensed firearm is used in the commission of any crime, there can be no separate offense of simple illegal possession of firearms. Hence, if the "other crime" is murder or homicide, illegal possession of firearms becomes merely an aggravating circumstance, not a separate offense. . . .<br><br>Moreover, penal laws are construed liberally in favor of the accused. In this case, the plain meaning of RA 8294's simple language is most favorable to herein appellant. Verily, no other interpretation is justified, for the language of the new law demonstrates the legislative intent to favor the accused.<br></blockquote>In the cases at bar, the crime of robbery with homicide with the use of unlicensed firearms was committed by appellants. In line with law and jurisprudence, the use of unlicensed firearms merely aggravates the crime of robbery with homicide. It does not constitute a separate crime. Necessarily, the conviction of appellants for illegal possession of firearms has to be set aside.<br><br>Under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, a person guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide shall suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. There being an aggravating circumstance, the penalty of death is imposable in the case at bar. However, Republic Act No. 7659 (Death Penalty Law) was approved only on December 13, 1993.&nbsp; The penalty of death being disadvantageous to the appellants, the law cannot be given any retroactive effect.
