				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 143, finding appellant Romeo Mole y Santos guilty of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the victim P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> charged appellant as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 13<sup>th</sup> day of April, 1997 in the City of Makati, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one EMERITA REYES Y TAMAYO, against her will and consent.<br></blockquote>On motion of the prosecution, the accusatory portion was later amended to read:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 13<sup>th</sup> day of April, 1997 in the City of Makati, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one EMERITA REYES Y TAMAYO, against her will and consent<i>, while dizzy or otherwise unconscious.</i> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Culled from the documentary and the testimonial evidence for the prosecution consisting of the testimonies of the following witnesses, <i>to wit</i>: private complainant Emerita Reyes (Emerita);  Aurea Villena, the Medico- Legal Officer from the National Bureau of Investigation; SPO4 Lilia R. Hogar, the police investigator; and Wildredo Reyes, the husband of Emerita, are the following:<br><br>On April 11, 1997, the then 34-year old Emerita, her husband Wilfredo and their three children consulted appellant, Romeo Mole, an <i>albularyo</i> (quack doctor), in the latter's house, they having been experiencing itchiness all over their bodies.  Appellant, diagnosing the Reyeses to be victims of <i> kulam</i><i> </i>(witchcraft), asked for and was given P935.00 for the purchase of 17 black candles which he needed to insulate them from the spell.  Appellant asked them to return the next day for treatment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>As advised, the Reyeses returned to appellant's house the next day, April 12, 1997.  On appellant's instructions, the Reyeses removed their clothes upon which appellant massaged their bodies one at a time with cotton dipped in oil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>After the "treatment," the Reyeses repaired home, accompanied by appellant who brought with him two black candles. Upon reaching the Reyeses' house, appellant lit the candles and placed one at the main door and another near the door of the kitchen.  He then invited Emerita's husband Wilfredo to drink gin while waiting for the candles to burn out. After three shots, Wilfredo became dizzy and passed out. Appellant thereupon brought Wilfredo to the only bedroom of the house and blew something on his (Wilfredo's) chest. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At about 11:00 p.m., appellant left the Reyeses' residence after asking for and receiving the amount of P350.00 representing payment for his services. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Emerita then went to sleep.  At about 12:00 midnight, however, she heard someone knock at the main door. Clad in a <i>duster</i>, she opened the door and saw appellant who was looking for her youngest son, he saying that "the sorcerer will take and kill him" and to save him (the son), appellant needed P2,500.00. Panicky and crying, Emerita immediately gave the said amount to appellant who thereafter went to the bedroom and sprinkled a pungent liquid on Wilfredo and their three children. Appellant also sprinkled the same liquid on Emerita, blew something on her chest and, while looking at her eyes, mumbled as if in prayer at which point Emerita instantly felt weak and dizzy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant then dragged Emerita to the kitchen, laid her on the floor and removed her underwear. She felt appellant, who was naked from the waist down, lie on top of her. While she wanted to resist she was too weak and dizzy and eventually lost consciousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Before losing consciousness, however, Emerita felt something heavy on her breast as appellant lay on top of her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>When Emerita regained consciousness, appellant had left and her entire body, including her vagina, was aching. She was later to declare in the course of her testimony in court, when asked why her vagina was aching, that appellant "raped" her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The next morning, or on April 13, 1997, Emerita, without the knowledge of her husband, reported her experience to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Her husband, however, was informed by a neighbor that Emerita went to the police station, prompting him to follow her. On arrival at the police station, he was unable to talk to his wife, and it was only on her return home at around 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. of that day that Emerita related to him the incidents that occurred the night before, albeit he could not remember if Emerita ever mentioned to him that she became unconscious, because there have been a lot of things which then occupied his mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On April 14, 1997, Emerita was physically examined by Dr. Aurea Villena who found multiple lacerations on her hymen which are secondary to child birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and noted the following:<br><ol> <li>No extragenital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of the examination.<br><br></li><li>Hymen, reduced to myrtiformis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></li></ol>At the witness stand, the doctor disclosed that the seminology examination conducted on Emerita yielded negative result, and that there was no medical basis to conclude that she had been subjected to sexual abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>From the Final Investigation Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of SPO4 Lilia Hogar to whom the case was referred for investigation, the following <i>datum </i>appears:<br><blockquote><center>x x x</center><br>07. Suspect ROMEO MOLE when apprised of his constitutional rights admitted raping EMERITA and also told the same admission to the PRESS people who interviewed him.<br></blockquote><center>x x x</center><br>SPO4 Hogar's testimony in court was dispensed with after the prosecution stipulated that appellant was investigated and "gave the statement to her." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Appellant on the other hand denied the accusation.  He claims that it was his wife Adoracion Mole, not him, who treated Emerita;  that both Emerita and Wilfredo were awake when he returned to their house on the night of April 13, 1997; that he merely fell asleep on the Reyeses' sofa in the living room; and that when he awoke at around 8:00 the following morning, Wilfredo even offered him breakfast which he turned down as it was already late. He, however, admitted that there is no reason why Emerita would file a complaint for rape against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Appellant's testimony was corroborated by his wife Adoracion Mole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Giving weight to the testimony of Emerita and relying on Romeo's verbal admission to SPO4 Hogar of having raped the victim, as reflected in the aforementioned <i>datum </i>in the Final Investigation Report, the trial court convicted appellant of rape by the assailed decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds Romeo Mole y Santos GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape. Accordingly, accused Romeo Mole y Santos is hereby sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA and to INDEMNIFY private complainant Emerita Reyes y Tamayo in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>In his brief, appellant assigns the following errors to the trial court:<br><ol> <li>.  . . .  In deciding the case by mere confusion or supposition, and in failing to consider certain unrebutted substantial matters of facts tending to show the non-occurrence or at least a doubtful occurrence of rape.<br><br></li><li>.  . . . In failing to apply the rule that in case of doubt, the same must be resolved in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [21]</sup><br></li></ol>In rape cases, it is the primordial duty of the prosecution to present its case with clarity and persuasion to the end that conviction becomes the only logical and inevitable conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [22]</sup><br><br>And the credibility of the private complainant is of vital importance for, in view of the peculiar nature of rape, conviction or acquittal rests entirely upon her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It has thus become doctrine that the accused may be convicted even solely on the basis of the victim's testimony provided that the testimony is clear, credible, convincing, unshaken by rigid cross-examination and unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Although the findings of trial courts are normally respected and not disturbed on appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> inconsistencies in the testimony of Emerita put serious doubts on her claim of rape, compelling this Court to reverse appellant's conviction.<br><br>Thus, on direct examination, she related that appellant, who was naked from waist down, lay on top of her after removing her underwear, whereupon she lost consciousness; and that after she regained consciousness, her entire body, including her vagina, was aching.  She thus concluded that she was raped:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You mean Madam Witness that after your panty was removed and accused was able to l[ay] you down [o]n the floor you lost consciousness and you don't remember anything?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Q</b></div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Prior [to] you[r] los[s of] consciousness, what was the accused doing [to] you that you could remember?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>A</b></div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I just felt that there was something heavy on my breast, sir.</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was the condition of your body when you regained consciousness?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I felt pain all over my body, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q</div> </td> <td> <div align="justify">What particular portion of your body was aching or suffering from pain?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A</div> </td> <td> <div align="justify">My whole body and also my vagina, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"> </div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know of any reason why your vagina is aching?</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"> </div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What was that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He raped me, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>On cross-examination, Emerita gave the following account:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.
