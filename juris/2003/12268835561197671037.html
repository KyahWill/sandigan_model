Morales (Melanie) was on her way home to Bitan-agan, Butuan City from the creek after washing clothes, she saw x x x Danilo Andrade (appellant), a neighbor, seated under a [star apple] tree.&nbsp; Melanie did not pay attention to him and proceeded to walk home.&nbsp; As she walked past him, appellant pulled her left hand and dragged her towards the bushes.&nbsp; Melanie was 13 years old at that time.<br><br>"Melanie shouted for help but appellant covered her mouth and pointed a bolo at her, with a warning not to make any noise.&nbsp; Melanie struggled (`kisi-kisi') in vain.&nbsp; Appellant was able to push her down.&nbsp; While lying down, appellant remove[d] her pants and her panty.&nbsp; All the while, Melanie struggled to free herself but her strength was no match to that of appellant.&nbsp; She was trying to close her thighs but he was able to keep her legs apart.&nbsp; He removed his pants, placed himself on top of Melanie and inserted his penis into her vagina.&nbsp; Melanie felt pain in her organ. She told him to stop because she felt pain but appellant continued, making push and pull movements, until he was satisfied.&nbsp; Appellant then stood up, put on his clothes and warned Melanie not to tell anyone, otherwise he would kill her.&nbsp; Upon reaching home, Melanie immediately told her mother, Nena Morales, about the rape because it was the second time that she was sexually abused by appellant.<br><br>"About noontime of the same day, while Maria Estrada was on her way to the house of Nena Morales to get the bathrobe the latter borrowed from her, Estrada saw appellant running downhill going towards the barangay proper.&nbsp; As Estrada reached Nena's house, she learned about the rape incident.&nbsp; Forthwith, Melanie, her mother and Estrada went to the barangay captain but the latter was not in, so they went home.<br><br>"On their way back, Melanie, Nena and Estrada passed by the house of appellant, which was along the way to Nena's house.&nbsp; Nena talked to Mayeth, appellant's wife.&nbsp; Nena told her about the incident.&nbsp; Mayeth went to fetch appellant in the field.&nbsp; When appellant and Mayeth came back, Nena confronted him but he denied, saying he did not rape Melanie but he only hugged and kissed her.&nbsp; Mayeth was enraged and hit appellant.&nbsp; Afterwards, appellant apologized to Nena and Melanie and asked for forgiveness.&nbsp; Mayeth then said that it would be better for her and appellant to leave the place because of the scandal that he did.&nbsp; Estrada, however, commented that they should not leave if appellant had not done anything wrong.&nbsp; However, Nena, just to prevent the couple from leaving the place, pretended by saying that she would no longer bring the matter to the barangay captain.&nbsp; Nena, Melanie and Estrada then went home.<br><br>"On the following morning, December 29, 1996, Melanie and Nena went to the office of the Barangay Captain and reported the matter to Barangay Kagawad Angeles Apatan, who accompanied them to the police station at Barangay Amparo.&nbsp; Thereat, Melanie executed her affidavit and a complaint for rape against appellant was filed, after which appellant was arrested.&nbsp; Melanie and Nena then proceeded to the City General Hospital at Languihan, Butuan City for medical examination.<br><br>"In the afternoon of December 29, 1996, Melanie was examined by Dr. Rhodora Gliceria Monton-Anino, medical officer of City General Hospital, Languihan, Butuan City, who thereafter issued a medical certificate (Exhibit `B').&nbsp; Dr. Anino found an old hymeneal laceration at 3, 5, 8 o'clock positions; fourchette intact, round in contour; the introitus admitted easily a vaginal speculum; erosions at the anterior lip of the cervix; negative for spermatozoa. Dr. Anino later testified and explained that the normal form of fourchette is V-shape while the contour is rounded if there is a stretch on it, and that based on her examination, the cervical erosions could be caused by an infection or force applied on it such as constant rubbing of the penis to the cervix."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><i><u><b>Version of the Defense</b></u></i><br></div><br>On the other hand, the defense, in its Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> narrates its version of the facts in this wise:<br><blockquote> "Accused Danilo Andrade denied having anything to do with the crime ascribed against him as he was then working in the farm of Elit Obungen at Nocnocan.&nbsp; In refuting the charge against him, he testified that the private complainant's mother, Nena Morales, is his paramour.&nbsp; The illicit relationship started in 1992 when Nena Morales used to tempt him by going to his farm house to borrow soap and fetch water. On several occasions, Nena Morales used to wear shorts.&nbsp; In 1995, he got married.&nbsp; But this did not stop Nena Morales from seeing him in Bitan-agan.&nbsp; After arriving from Cagayan de Oro, he proceeded to his farm and later to the house of his sister.&nbsp; Nena Morales followed him.&nbsp; Thereat, Nena Morales told him that he would not be able to see her anymore because she would be floating in [the] Agusan River.&nbsp; Nena Morales also told him that he will not have peace in his family as she is going to make trouble.&nbsp; After telling him that she would commit suicide, Nena Morales went to his house many times drunk.&nbsp; As he kept on avoiding her, he later learned that Nena Morales slashed herself.&nbsp; When Nena Morales recovered, she went to his house and created trouble.&nbsp; As proof that he and Nena Morales were lovers, they used to check in at a hotel. They also had sexual intercourse in the farm several times.<br><br>"Mayet Andrade corroborated the foregoing testimony of the accused.&nbsp; She testified that it is not true that they asked forgiveness from Nena Morales about the incident.&nbsp; Instead, she only confronted Nena Morales why she filed a case against the accused. Nena Morales told her that she was only filing the case against the accused because she wanted to take revenge. In her conversation with the private complainant, the latter told her that she was not raped by the accused.<br><br>"SPO2 Teofilo Maquilling Pame identified the police blotter and the entries made therein on December 30, 1996 regarding the complaint of the victim, Melanie Morales for x x x attempted rape, which allegedly happed on December 28, 1996 at Purok 4, Bitan-agan, Butuan City."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>Weighing the merits of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, the court <i>a quo </i>held that the sole testimony of the victim was sufficient to convict appellant of rape.<br><br>The trial court rejected the "hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned" defense proffered by appellant.&nbsp; According to him, in order to take revenge for his refusal to continue their sexual relations, complainant's mother convinced her daughter to file the Complaint against him.&nbsp; In dismissing this argument, the trial court held that just to assuage her own hurt feelings, no mother would stoop so low as to subject her daughter to the hardship and the shame concomitant with a rape prosecution.&nbsp; It would be quite unnatural for a parent to use her offspring as a means to sow malice, especially if the latter would be subjected to embarrassment and lifelong stigma in the process.&nbsp; Moreover, it found that the alleged illicit relationship between appellant and complainant's mother had not been substantiated.<br><br>The lower court likewise rejected the defense of alibi.&nbsp; The claim of appellant that he was working in Nocnocan when the crime occurred in Bitan-agan cannot exculpate him.&nbsp; The two towns were shown to be only three kilometers away from each other.&nbsp; In fact, it was in his house in Bitan-agan where he was arrested by the police the next day.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues</span><br></div><br>In his Brief, appellant raises the following alleged errors for our consideration:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> "I<br></div><br>The trial court erred in not rejecting the highly implausible and conflicting testimony of the private complainant anent the crime charged.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>The trial court erred in convicting the accused-appellant of rape considering that the private complainant did not offer any tenacious resistance.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III<br></div><br>The trial court erred in not giving full faith and credence to the evidence proffered by the defense.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"IV<br></div><br>The trial court erred in rendering a verdict of conviction despite the failure of the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>First and Fourth Issues:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</i></u></b><br></div><br>Rape is committed, <i>inter alia,</i> when a man has carnal knowledge of the victim with the use of force and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In this case, the victim is a 13-year-old girl from Butuan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> To demonstrate how clearly and convincingly she narrated her defilement, we extensively quote her testimony as follows:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"PROSECUTOR GUIRITAN:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">And, how far were you to Danilo when you saw him seated for the first time under the star apple tree?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">He was also about five (5) brazas from where I was.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q </td> <td><div align="justify">When you saw him, what did you do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">I did not pay attention to him.

The defense failed to cast doubts on her credibility, as she stuck to her story during the cross-examination.&nbsp; Moreover, her claims were supported by the medical report of Dr. Rhodora Gliceria Monton-Anino, who had examined her the day after the rape incident.<br><br>We thus find no reason to doubt the victim.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that a young girl would cry rape, allow an examination of her private parts, undergo the trouble and the humiliation of public and open trial, and put herself and her family under public scrutiny, if she were not motivated to bring to justice the person who had defiled her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It is highly unlikely for a young Filipina of decent repute to admit publicly that she was raped, unless that statement is the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In this case, since the testimony of the victim was straightforward and candid, unshaken by rigid cross-examination, and unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points, it must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Second Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>The Victim's Credibililty</i></u></b><br></div><br>In attacking the credibility of the victim, appellant argues that complainant reported only the second, but not the first, alleged rape incident.&nbsp; He argues that even if the frequency of commission is not an element of the crime, the fact that she did not bother to take steps to put her supposed rapist behind bars after he had ravished her the first time militates against her reliability.<br><br>We clarify.&nbsp; In general, delay in reporting rape does not imply that the charge is not true, as the victim usually prefers to bear the ignominy of pain silently, rather than to reveal her harrowing experience and expose her shame to the world.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It is understandable for a victim to take some time to come to terms with the rape and muster enough courage to bring her defiler to justice.&nbsp; Such delay is not unusual, especially when the victim is a minor.<br><br>In this case, however, there was no delay in reporting the rape.&nbsp; Complainant told her mother about it the same day it occurred.&nbsp; They then filed a Complaint against appellant the next day.&nbsp; Complainant's failure to report the alleged first rape does not belie her narration of the supposedly second incident that occurred on December 28, 1996.&nbsp; Evidence of the first occurrence of rape is not a requirement for proving the second one.<br><br>Appellant contends that the testimony of the victim is riddled with inconsistencies.&nbsp; According to him, a proof that her testimony is not credible is the fact that she initially testified that the rape had taken place on August 17, 1995, a Saturday, only to retract her claim when she was shown a 1995 calendar showing that the date fell on a Thursday.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; The exact day of the week when rape was committed is not required in proving it; neither is the precise time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Besides, the determination of which day of the week August 17, 1995 fell pertains to the alleged first rape, which is not the subject of the Complaint.<br><br>Appellant further argues that the actuations of complainant were not typical of a rape victim.&nbsp; She testified that she became afraid of appellant after he had raped her on August 17, 1995.&nbsp; But upon the invitation of appellant's wife, complainant still took her lunch at his house several times from January to March 1996.<br><br>The first rape is not an issue here.&nbsp; That the wife of appellant is a trusted friend of complainant does not disprove the occurrence of the rape. The point is that the latter never ate lunch at his house when she knew she would be alone with him; she was always with his wife, Mayeth.&nbsp; Otherwise, serious doubts would have indeed been cast on the claim of complainant that she had resisted the rape or that it had ever occurred at all.<br><br>The defense insists that complainant did not vigorously reject the sexual advances of appellant. Otherwise, she would have been able to escape from his hold when he was no longer pointing his bolo at her.<br><br>Force and intimidation need not be overwhelming to constitute rape.&nbsp; It is not essential for the victim to have resisted her assailant to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Physical resistance need not be established when threats and intimidation were employed and the victim submitted herself to the rapist because of fear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues that the testimony of the victim is not supported by the physical evidence on record. According to him, although she concluded that he had ejaculated inside her vagina because she allegedly felt something warm inside, the doctor reported that she did not find any spermatozoa during the medical examination.<br><br>The absence of spermatozoa does not disprove rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In this case, the examination made by Dr. Monton-Anino sufficiently supports penetration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> A careful reading of the medical certificate she issued would reveal that it does not contradict complainant's claim.<br><br>The time-tested rule is that the evaluation of the credibility of a witness by the trial court is given great weight and respect by appellate courts, unless it is shown to have overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In this case, we do not find any reason to deviate from this general rule.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Third Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Evidence for the Defense</i></u></b><br></div><br>Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overlooking the fact that after the incident was recorded on the police blotter on December 30, 1996, no succeeding entry was made for the next three months.&nbsp; The police blotter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> indicated that appellant had merely held the hand of complainant and attempted to kiss her.&nbsp; There was no mention of rape.&nbsp; According to appellant, the blotter shows that the rape charge against him was a mere afterthought.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; A police blotter, like any other extrajudicial statement, cannot prevail over testimony in open court.&nbsp; The declaration of a child-victim during an initial investigation cannot be expected to be completely coherent with her testimony taken in much greater detail during the trial of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Because of the rapist's threats on her life, her fear of public humiliation or simply lack of courage, it would not be uncommon for a young, immature girl to conceal for a time the rape perpetrated on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby <b><i>DENIED, </i></b>and the assailed Decision <b><i>AFFIRMED.</i></b><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez</i>, and <i>Carpio-Morales, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Corona, J.</i>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Cipriano B.
