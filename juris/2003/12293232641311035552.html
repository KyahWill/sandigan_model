				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before this Court is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals Decision of May 31, 1996 and Resolution of December 9, 1996.<br><br>On February 7, 1990, herein petitioner-appellant Felicito G. Sanson (Sanson), in his capacity as creditor, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City a petition, docketed as Special Proceedings No. 4497, for the settlement of the estate of Juan Bon Fing Sy (the deceased) who died on January 10, 1990. Sanson claimed that the deceased was indebted to him in the amount of P603,000.00 and to his sister Celedonia Sanson-Saquin (Celedonia) in the amount of P360,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioners-appellants Eduardo Montinola, Jr. and his mother Angeles Montinola (Angeles) later filed separate claims against the estate, alleging that the deceased owed them P50,000.00 and P150,000.00, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>By Order of February 12, 1991, Branch 28 of the Iloilo RTC to which the petition was raffled, appointed Melecia T. Sy, surviving spouse of the deceased, as administratrix of his estate, following which she was issued letters of administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>During the hearing of the claims against the estate, Sanson, Celedonia, and Jade Montinola, wife of claimant Eduardo Montinola, Jr., testified on the transactions that gave rise thereto, over the objection of the administratrix who invoked Section 23, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court otherwise known as the Dead Man’s Statute which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 23. <i>Disqualification by reason of death or insanity of adverse party</i>.—Parties or assignors of parties to a case, or persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted, against an executor or administrator or other representative of a deceased person, or against a person of unsound mind, upon a claim or demand against the estate of such deceased person or against such person of unsound mind, <b>cannot testify</b> as to any matter of fact occurring before the death of such deceased person or before such person became of unsound mind. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Sanson, in support of the claim of his sister Celedonia, testified that she had a transaction with the deceased which is evidenced by six checks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> issued by him before his death; before the deceased died, Celedonia tried to enforce settlement of the checks from his (the deceased’s) son Jerry who told her that his father would settle them once he got well but he never did; and after the death of the deceased, Celedonia presented the checks to the bank for payment but were dishonored<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> due to the closure of his account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Celedonia, in support of the claim of her brother Sanson, testified that she knew that the deceased issued five checks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to Sanson in settlement of a debt; and after the death of the deceased, Sanson presented the checks to the bank for payment but were returned due to the closure of his account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Jade, in support of the claims of her husband Eduardo Montinola, Jr. and mother-in-law Angeles, testified that on separate occasions, the deceased borrowed P50,000 and P150,000 from her husband and mother-in-law, respectively, as shown by three checks issued by the deceased,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> two to Angeles and the other<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to Eduardo Montinola, Jr.; before the deceased died or sometime in August 1989, they advised him that they would be depositing the checks, but he told them not to as he would pay them cash, but he never did; and after the deceased died on January 10, 1990, they deposited the checks but were dishonored as the account against which they were drawn was closed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> hence, their legal counsel sent a demand letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated February 6, 1990 addressed to the deceased’s heirs Melicia, James, Mini and Jerry Sy, and Symmels I &amp; II but the checks have remained unsettled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The administratrix, denying having any knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the claims, nevertheless alleged that if they ever existed, they had been paid and extinguished, are usurious and illegal and are, in any event, barred by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> And she objected to the admission of the checks and check return slips-exhibits offered in evidence by the claimants upon the ground that the witnesses who testified thereon are disqualified under the Dead Man’s Statute.<br><br>Specifically with respect to the checks-exhibits identified by Jade, the administratrix asserted that they are inadmissible because Jade is the daughter-in-law of claimant Angeles and wife of claimant Eduardo Montinola, Jr., hence, she is covered by the above-said rule on disqualification.<br><br>At all events, the administratrix denied that the checks-exhibits were issued by the deceased and that the return slips were issued by the depository/clearing bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After the claimants rested their case, the administratrix filed four separate manifestations informing the trial court that <u>she was dispensing with the presentation of evidence against their claims</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Finding that the Dead Man’s Statute does not apply to the witnesses who testified in support of the subject claims against the estate, the trial court issued an Order of December 8, 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, Judicial Administratrix Melecia T.

(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The claimants’ Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the Court of Appeals decision having been denied by Resolution of December 9, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> they filed the present petition anchored on the following assigned errors:<br><blockquote><u><center>FIRST ASSIGNED ERROR</center></u><br>RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS, 4<sup>TH</sup> DIVISION, ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF JADE MONTINOLA IS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE CLAIMS OF CLAIMANTS ANGELES A. MONTINOLA AND EDUARDO A. MONTINOLA, JR..<br><center><br><u>SECOND ASSIGNED ERROR</u></center><br>RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS, 4<sup>TH</sup> DIVISION, ERRED IN FINDING THAT CLAIMANT FELICITO G. SANSON IS DISQUALIFIED TO TESTIFY [ON] THE CLAIM OF CELEDONIA SANSON-SA[Q]UIN AND VI[C]E VERSA. (Underscoring in the original)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>With respect to the first assigned error, petitioners argue that since the administratrix did not deny the testimony of Jade nor present any evidence to controvert it, and neither did she deny the execution and genuineness of the checks issued by the deceased (as well as the check return slips issued by the clearing bank), it was error for the Court of Appeals to find the evidence of the Montinolas insufficient to prove their claims.<br><br>The administratrix counters that the due execution and authenticity of the checks-exhibits of the Montinolas were not duly proven since Jade did not categorically state that she saw the filling up and signing of the checks by the deceased, hence, her testimony is self-serving; besides, as Jade had identical and unitary interest with her husband and mother-in-law, her testimony was a circumvention of the Dead Man’s Statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The administratrix’s counter-argument does not lie. Relationship to a party has never been recognized as an adverse factor in determining either the credibility of the witness or—subject only to well recognized exceptions none of which is here present—the admissibility of the testimony. At most, closeness of relationship to a party, or bias, may indicate the need for a little more caution in the assessment of a witness’ testimony but is not necessarily a negative element which should be taken as diminishing the credit otherwise accorded to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Jade’s testimony on the genuineness of the deceased’s signature on the checks-exhibits of the Montinolas is clear:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td colspan="2" valign="CENTER">x x x</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td colspan="2"> <br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td valign="top">Q:</td><td width="85%">Showing to you this check dated July 16, 1989, Far East Bank and Trust Company Check No. 84262, in the amount of P100,000.00, is this the check you are referring to?</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td colspan="2"> <br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>A:</td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td colspan="2"> <br></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td valign="top">Q:</td><td>There appears a signature in the face of the check.

The rule renders incompetent: <b>1) parties to a case; 2) their assignors; or 3) persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted.</b><br><blockquote><center>x x x</center><br>The rule is exclusive and cannot be construed to extend its scope by implication so as to disqualify persons not mentioned therein. <u>Mere witnesses who are not included in the above enumeration are not prohibited from testifying as to a conversation or transaction between the deceased and a third person, if he took no active part therein</u>.<br><center><br>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></center></blockquote>Jade is not a party to the case. Neither is she an assignor nor a person in whose behalf the case is being prosecuted. She testified as a witness to the transaction. In transactions similar to those involved in the case at bar, the witnesses are commonly family members or relatives of the parties. Should their testimonies be excluded due to their apparent interest as a result of their relationship to the parties, there would be a dearth of evidence to prove the transactions. In any event, as will be discussed later, independently of the testimony of Jade, the claims of the Montinolas would still prosper on the basis of their documentary evidence—the checks.<br><br>As to the second assigned error, petitioners argue that the testimonies of Sanson and Celedonia as witnesses to each other’s claim against the deceased are not covered by the Dead Man’s Statute;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> besides, the administratrix waived the application of the law when she cross-examined them.<br><br>The administratrix, on the other hand, cites the ruling of the Court of Appeals in its decision on review, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>The more logical interpretation is to prohibit <u>parties to a case</u>, <b>with like interest,</b> from testifying in each other’s favor as to acts occurring prior to the death of the deceased.<br><br>Since the law disqualifies parties to a case or assignors to a case without distinguishing between testimony in his own behalf and that in behalf of others, he should be disqualified from testifying for his co-parties. The law speaks of “<u>parties or assignors of parties to a case.</u>” Apparently, the testimonies of Sanson and Saquin on each other’s behalf, as co-parties to the same case, falls under the prohibition. (Citation omitted; underscoring in the original and emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>But Sanson’s and Celedonia’s claims against the same estate arose from separate transactions. Sanson is a third party with respect to Celedonia’s claim. And Celedonia is a third party with respect to Sanson’s claim. One is not thus disqualified to testify on the other’s transaction.<br><br>In any event, what the Dead Man’s Statute proscribes is the admission of <u>testimonial</u> evidence upon a claim which arose before the death of the deceased. The incompetency is confined to the <u>giving of testimony</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Since the separate claims of Sanson and Celedonia are supported by checks-<u>documentary</u> evidence, their claims can be prosecuted on the bases of said checks.<br><br>This brings this Court to the matter of the authenticity of the signature of the deceased appearing on the checks issued to Sanson and Celedonia.
