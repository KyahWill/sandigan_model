Vallejo, Darwin O. Llarenas, Romeo Q. Tipasi, Jr. and Arnold A. Camo, appellants, guilty of robbery with homicide and imposing upon them the supreme penalty of death.<br><br>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed against appellants reads:<br><blockquote>"That on or about April 3, 1994, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused conspiring and confederating together with others whose true names, identities and present whereabouts are still unknown, and helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to gain and by means of force, violence and intimidation, to wit: by barging inside Bell All Sales Corporation while armed with firearms, and once inside, take, rob and carry away cash money amounting to approximately P63,000.00 and other personal properties, belonging to SANTOS DELOS SANTOS Y CHUA, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the aforesaid amount of P63,000.00, Philippine currency; that in the commission of the said offense, the said accused in pursuance of their conspiracy and by reason of the aforesaid robbery, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill, attack, assault and use personal violence upon said Santos delos Santos y Chua by shooting the latter on the left portion of his back with a .380 caliber, thereby inflicting upon him mortal gunshot wound which was the direct and immediate cause of his death thereafter.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<br></blockquote>Upon arraignment on June 16, 1994, appellants, assisted by their respective counsel, pleaded "not guilty"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [3]</sup> to the charge.  Thereafter, trial ensued.  The prosecution presented eight witnesses, namely: PO3 Ramon Torrefiel, Armando Opeña, Vilma Nobleza, Rita Delos Santos (the victim's wife), PO3 Erlindo Lomboy, Arthur Portalla, Chua Yu Chun, and Dr. Marcial Lagonera.   Their testimonies established the following:<br><br>Santos Delos Santos Chua was the General Manager of Bell All Sales Corporation (BASC) located at 2867 Lamayan Street, Sta. Ana, Manila. Its compound has two gates.  The big gate is for incoming and outgoing vehicles and can be opened and closed manually.   The small gate can be opened only by a remote electronic control situated inside the office of Chua.<br><br>On April 3, 1994 at around 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, while Armando Opeña, driver of BASC, was cleaning a car in the garage situated two meters away from Chua's office, he overheard somebody talking through the intercom. Then the lock inside the small gate was released and he saw appellant Dindo Vallejo entering the compound through this gate. Vallejo was a former live-in employee of the corporation and oftentimes recommended to Chua applicants for employment.  Vallejo then approached the big gate and tried to open it. Armando stopped him, instructing him to ask Chua's permission.  So Armando accompanied Vallejo to Chua's office.  Upon seeing Vallejo, Chua asked him about the person he was recommending for work.  Vallejo replied that he was recommending a utility boy. Meanwhile, Armando left and resumed cleaning the car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Moments later, Vallejo rushed back to the big gate and opened it. Several persons entered. Appellants Romeo Tipasi and Arnold Camo poked their guns at Armando and ordered him to lie down on the back seat of the car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Appellants Vallejo and Darwin Llarenas went inside Chua's office, while the other two proceeded to the adjacent room where Vilma Nobleza, a checker of the corporation, was supervising employees repacking sugar.  Appellants' other companions stood as look-out while the heist was going on.<br><br>Armando, then being guarded by two persons, heard a commotion inside Chua's office.  Chua was shouting.   Shortly thereafter, Armando heard gun shots.<br><br>Armando, Vilma and Rita de los Santos (Chua's wife) saw the bloodied Chua being carried by three persons to the warehouse adjacent to the garage. While he was lying face down, appellant Darwin Llarenas shot him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> At that instance, Armando heard someone shouting "<i>takbo Na</i>!"  All the assailants fled.   Arthur Portalla, victim's neighbor, saw them escaped through a yellow taxi with Plate No. NYT 417 proceeding towards Panaderos Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Immediately, Armando and Rita brought Chua to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Sta. Mesa, Manila.  He died three hours later.  Armando returned to the compound and found Yu Chun taking pictures, identified and marked during the hearing as Exhibits "P" - "P-20".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>PO3 Torrefiel, SPO1 Efren Cruz and SPO1 Julius Bustamante, of the Western Police District (WPD), conducted an investigation.  They proceeded to the crime scene at Sta. Ana, Manila and found the victim's office in complete disarray.   All the drawers of the tables were forcibly opened. Broken bottles were scattered on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> They recovered the following items: a ball cap with the markings "Toronto Blue Jays", marked as Exhibit "A"; a broken telephone receiver with blood stains, marked as Exhibit "B"; a broken Seiko watch with blood stains, marked as Exhibit "C"; two live bullets of a .380 caliber revolver with dot in the primer, marked as Exhibits "D" &amp; "D-1"; an empty shell of the same caliber, marked as Exhibit "D-2"; and a gun holster marked as Exhibit "E".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [10] </sup> Later, the police took Armando's sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> identifying all the appellants as the malefactors.<br><br>On April 4, 1994, upon the order of the Chief of Homicide Division, WPD, PO3 Lomboy, SPO1 William Gondranios, SPO1 Eduardo Liwanagan and SPO1 Norberto Panlilio arrested the appellants in their respective houses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> without warrants of arrest.  They recovered from appellant Darwin Llarenas an Omega wrist watch, marked as Exhibit "I"; from appellant Romeo Tipasi, a gold Cross ballpen with the engraved name of the victim, marked as Exhibit "H"; and a black wallet, marked as Exhibit "G".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13] </sup> All these items belonged to the victim. Then the appellants were placed in a police line-up and were identified by Armando.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Vilma and Rita corroborated the testimony of Armando and positively identified the appellants as the perpetrators of the crime.<br><br>Rita testified that it was appellant Darwin Llarenas who shot her husband. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He was 47 years old and was earning P50,000.00 a month when he died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> She enumerated some of his personal belongings taken by the appellants, such as:  one Omega wrist watch valued at P70,000.00; one black wallet; one gold Cross ballpen worth P1,000.00; and P63,000.00 she placed in the drawer of her husband's office table intended for the salaries of the employees.  She incurred P500,000.00 for his funeral expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Dr. Lagonera, Medico-Legal Officer of the WPD who conducted the post- mortem examination of Chua, submitted a Report with the following findings:<br><ol> "External Findings:<br><br><li>Lacerated wound, left parietal region, measuring 1x0.3 cm.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, stellate in shape, left frontal region, measuring 0.4x0.4 cm.<br><br></li><li>Contusso-abrasion, right forehead, measuring 9x3 cms.<br><br></li><li>Abrasion, right zygomatic region, measuring 2x2 cms.<br><br></li><li>Abrasion, bridge of the nose, measuring 6x2 cms.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, left zygomatic region, measuring 1x0.2 cms.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, left parietal region, measuring 3x0.4 cms.<br><br></li><li>Lacerated wound, mid-occipital region, measuring 0.5x0.2 cm <br><br></li><li>Abrasion, left infra-clavicular region, measuring 2x0.3 cms.<br><br></li><li>Abrasion, left posterior shoulder, measuring 2x1 cms.<br><br></li><li>Gunshot wound, with the point of entry at the left posterior lumbar region, 37 inches from heel, 9 cms.

A copper coated slug was extracted in the sub-cutaneous tissue in the right iliac region, 35 inches from heel and 8 cms. from anterior midline.</li></ol><u></u><ol><u> "Internal findings:<br></u><br><li>Injuries to organs and tissues as indicated in the internal extension of the gunshot wound, with massive bleeding in the pelvic cavity.<br><br></li><li>The rest of the internal organs were pale.<br><br></li><li>Small amount of partially digested rice meal with meaty materials and without alcoholic odor was recovered from the stomach."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></li></ol>All the appellants raised the defenses of denial and <i>alibi.</i>   They denied connivance in the commission of the crime. According to them, they did not know each other prior to their arrest.<br><br>Appellant Dindo Vallejo declared on the witness stand that at the time of the incident, he was in his brother's house at 65 V. Luna, Quezon City where he has been residing for about a year.  He could not go out of the house as he was sick with pulmonary tuberculosis and was vomiting blood.  In fact, he was hospitalized at the Quezon Institute from March 20-26, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> His sister-in-law, Rose Vallejo, corroborated his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup><br><br>Appellant Darwin Llarenas, a dried shrimps vendor, testified that on April 3, 1994, which was Easter Sunday, he and his wife and their two children attended mass at the Sta. Mesa Parish Church. They returned home at 392 Parcel Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila at around 10:00 o'clock in the morning. He cooked lunch as they were preparing a small gathering for his brother coming from the province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup>  Before lunchtime, he went to the house of Cristina Latine and invited her.  After lunch, they had a drinking spree with the visitors. Meantime, he repacked dried shrimps and gave them to Adela Editha Jameliano.  Both Editha and Cristina left late in the afternoon. The party ended at almost 7:00 o'clock in the evening and, thereafter, he went to bed. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Cristina and Editha, as well as his mother and wife, corroborated his testimony.<br><br>Appellant Arnold Camo, a barbeque vendor, testified that on April 3, 1994, he was in his house at 361 Parcel Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila because he was ill.  Two weeks prior to that date, he was already sick and bedridden. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> His left ear was swollen and he had fever. He could hardly move because of so much pain. Dr. Ramos attended to him.  Several members of his family corroborated his testimony.<br><br>Appellant Romeo Tipasi gave the following version:  On April 3, 1994, at 10:30 in the morning, spouses Valentin and Patrocinia Leyte fetched him from his house at 295 Parcel Street, Sta.Mesa, Manila to stand as sponsor in the christening of their child.  They stayed in the church until past noon. Then he attended the reception held in the couple's house at 385 Parcel Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila until about past 6:00 o'clock in the evening. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Patrocinia Leyte corroborated his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [25]</sup><br><br>On May 16, 1996, the trial court rendered its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this court finds all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide with the aggravating circumstances of abused of superior strength and craft, without any mitigating circumstance, this court hereby imposes the penalty of DEATH in accordance with Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in relation to Article 63 of the same code and for the accused to indemnify the heirs of the victim jointly and solidarily the following:<br><blockquote>(a)     P50,000.00 for the death of the victim;<br><br>(b)     P156,000.00 as actual damages;<br><br>(c)     P6,072,000.00 as unrealized earnings of the victim;<br><br>(d)     P1,000.00 as moral damages;<br><br>(e)     P500,000.00 as exemplary damages; and<br><br>(f)      To pay the cost.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.  Quoted below are the assignments of error being ascribed to the trial court by the appellants:<br><br>By appellant Darwin Llarenas:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE AND IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO INDEMNIFY THE HEIRS OF VICTIM SOLIDARILY, THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS: P50,000.00 FOR THE DEATH OF VICTIM; P156,000.00 AS ACTUAL DAMAGES; P6,072,000.00 AS UNREALIZED EARNINGS OF THE VICTIM; P1,000.00 AS MORAL DAMAGES; P500,000.00 AS EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, AND; TO PAY THE COSTS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>By appellants Arnold Camo and Romeo Tipasi:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANTS ARNOLD CAMO AND ROMEO TIPASI, JR., ACTED IN CONSPIRACY WITH THE OTHER ACCUSED IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS TO SOLIDARILY PAY THE HEIRS OF THE VICTIM THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS: P50,000.00 FOR THE DEATH OF VICTIM; P156,000.00 AS ACTUAL DAMAGES; P6,072,000.00 AS UNREALIZED EARNINGS OF THE VICTIM; P1,000.00 AS MORAL DAMGES; P500,000.00 AS EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, AND; TO PAY THE COSTS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>By appellant Dindo Vallejo:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT ACTED IN CONSPIRACY WITH THE OTHER ACCUSED IN KILLING THE VICTIM.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE.<br><br><center>"III</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO SOLIDARILY PAY THE HEIRS OF THE VICTIM THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS: P50,000.00 FOR THE DEATH OF VICTIM; P156,000.00 AS ACTUAL DAMAGES; P6,072,000.00 AS UNREALIZED EARNINGS OF THE VICTIM; P1,000.00 AS MORAL DAMAGES; P500,000.00 AS EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, AND; TO PAY THE COSTS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The Solicitor General counters that the guilt of the appellants who acted in conspiracy, was established by evidence beyond reasonable doubt.  They were positively identified by the prosecution witnesses.   While there may be inconsistencies in their testimonies, the same do not affect their credibility. Moreover, appellants failed to prove by convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.   Lastly, there is no merit in their contention that their arrest without warrants is unconstitutional.   Any infirmity attending one's arrest is cured when the accused filed a petition for bail<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and/or when he entered a plea when arraigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>After a thorough review of the evidence on record, we affirm the conviction of all the appellants.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A. The arrest of the appellants</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">without warrants is</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> constitutional.</span><br><br>We have consistently held that any objection by the accused to an arrest without a warrant must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32] </sup> We have also ruled that an accused may be estopped from assailing the illegality of his arrest if he fails to move for the quashing of the information against him before his arraignment. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> And since the legality of an arrest affects only the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the accused, any defect in his arrest may be deemed cured when he voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as what was done by the appellants in the instant case.  Not only did they enter their pleas during arraignment, but they also actively participated during the trial which constitutes a waiver of any irregularity in their arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">B.        The appellants were</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">positively identified by the</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">prosecution witnesses.</span><br><br>Even if the warrantless arrest was unlawful and the evidence obtained inadmissible, the conviction of the appellants would still be in order because they were positively identified by eyewitnesses.   Verily, such identification is a vital and decisive evidence which virtually sealed appellants' culpability.<br><br>Appellants, however, contend that the prosecution witnesses could not possibly identify them.  Armando was lying face down during the commission of the crime; Rita was on the second floor when the commotion was taking place on the ground floor; and Vilma was in the adjacent room.<br><br>We are not persuaded. Armando testified on direct examination as follows:<b></b><br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

The alleged inconsistencies<br>in the testimonies of<br>prosecution witnesses do not<br>affect their credibility.</b><br><br>Although there are some inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, specifically as to the exact number of persons who entered the compound, due probably to the general confusion that characterized the incident, we hold that this imperfection does not diminish their credibility. What is important is the fact that there is a sustained consistency in their testimonies relating the principal elements of the crime and positively identifying the appellants as the perpetrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Moreover, truth-telling witnesses are not expected to give flawless testimonies, considering the lapse of time involved and the treachery of human memory.  We have ruled time and again that minor inconsistencies in the narration of witnesses do not detract from their essential credibility as long as their testimonies on the whole are coherent and intrinsically believable. Inaccuracies may in fact suggest that the witnesses are telling the truth and have not been rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>D.        Appellants' defenses of<br>denial and <i>alibi</i> failed to<br>meet the requisites of time<br>and place.</b><br><br>In the face of the positive identification of appellants by the prosecution witnesses, their defenses of denial and <i>alibi</i> must fall.   Denials, as negative and self-serving evidence, do not deserve as much weight in law as positive and affirmative testimonies.   Oft-repeated is the rule that for <i> alibi</i> to offset the evidence of the prosecution demonstrating appellants' guilt, they must establish not only that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed but that it was also physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was perpetrated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Here, the defense utterly failed to meet these requisites.<br><br>We take judicial notice of the fact that the residences of  appellants Llarenas, Camo and Tipasi, which are all in Sta. Mesa, Manila, where they claimed to have been at the time of the commission of the crime, are in close proximity to Sta. Ana, Manila, the<i> locus criminis.  </i>As for Vallejo, while he could have been in Quezon City, it was not physically impossible for him to have been in Sta. Ana, on the day the crime was perpetrated.   He could reach the crime scene after an hour travel.<br><br><b>E.        All the elements of the crime<br>are present.</b><br><br>The elements of robbery with homicide are the following:  (a) the taking of personal property with violence or intimidation against persons or with force upon things;  (b) the property taken belongs to another; (c) the taking be done with <i>animus lucrandi </i>(intent to gain); and (d) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, homicide in its generic sense was committed.  The offense becomes a special complex crime of robbery with homicide under Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code if the victim is killed on the occasion or by reason of the robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In this case, all the essential elements of robbery with homicide have been established by the prosecution by proof beyond reasonable doubt.   Personal properties and cash belonging to the victim were taken by appellants by means of force and intimidation, and with obvious intent to gain.   Moreover, in the course of the robbery, the victim was mercilessly gunned down by appellant.   When homicide takes place by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, all those who took part in the robbery shall be guilty of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide whether or not they actually participated in the killing, unless there is proof that they had endeavored to prevent the perpetration of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>    Here, this exception is not present.<br><br><b>F.         The appellants acted in<br>conspiracy.</b><br><br>In the case at bar, conspiracy was clearly manifested in the concerted efforts, unity of purpose and design in the execution of the offense by the appellants.  They were armed and entered the compound through the big gate.  Camo and Tipasi poked their guns at Armando and stood guard over him as he was lying down in the garage.  Meanwhile, Llarenas and Vallejo entered the office of the victim and shot him.  The other two also poked their guns at Vilma, while the others stayed within the vicinity to act as look-outs.  After the appellants and their cohorts forcibly seized the belongings of the victim, they shot him and ran away.  Their simultaneous acts indicate a joint purpose and concurrence of intentions.  Where the acts of the accused collectively and individually demonstrate the existence of a common design towards the accomplishment of the same unlawful purpose, conspiracy is evident, and all the perpetrators will be liable as principals. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>G.        Penalty</b><br><br>Pursuant to Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, robbery with homicide is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death<i>.   </i>Under Article 63, paragraph 1 of the same Code, the felons should be meted the supreme penalty of death when the crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance absent any mitigating circumstance.<br><br>In the present case, the trial court specified in the decretal portion of its Decision the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and craft in the commission of the crime.   Abuse of superior strength was present on account of the fact that appellants were not only numerically superior to the victim but also because all of them were armed and purposely used force out of proportion to the means of defense available to the victim.   Craft was also present as shown by the fact that appellant Vallejo pretended to recommend somebody for employment as a means to enter the compound without suspicion on the part of the victim. Hence, the trial court sentenced all the appellants to suffer the supreme penalty of death.<br><br>However, appellants may be spared from the extreme punishment of death. The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><i> </i>now explicitly requires qualifying as well as aggravating circumstances to be <b>expressly</b> and <b> specifically</b><i> </i>pleaded in the complaint or information, otherwise they will not be considered by the court even if proved during the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 8. <i>Designation of the offense</i>. - The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances.   If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.<br><br>"Sec. 9. <i>Cause of the accusation</i>. - The acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense and the qualifying and aggravating circumstances must be stated in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute but in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged as well as its qualifying and aggravating circumstances for the court to pronounce judgment."<br></blockquote>Section 8 simply provides that the information or complaint must state the designation of the offense given by the statute and specify its qualifying and generic aggravating circumstances.  With regard to Section 9, we held in <i> People vs. Nerio Suela</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [48]</sup><i> </i>that the use of the word `must' indicates that the requirement is mandatory and failure to comply with it means that generic aggravating circumstances, although proven at the trial, cannot be appreciated against the accused if such circumstances are not alleged in the information. Although the rule took effect on December 1, 2000, the same may be applied retroactively<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> because it is a cardinal rule that rules of criminal procedure are given retroactive application insofar as they benefit the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>So, while superior strength and craft were proven, however, they cannot aggravate the penalty for the crime since they were not alleged in the information.  There being no modifying circumstances that attended the commission of robbery with homicide, appellants should each be meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> conformably with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b>H.        Civil liabilities</b><br><br>Considering that appellants acted in conspiracy, they should be held jointly and severally liable for civil liabilities.  As correctly held by the trial court, appellants are jointly and severally liable to the heirs of the victim for civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 and for moral damages also in the amount of P50,000.00 for the pain and sorrow they suffered which were proved during the hearing.  In view of the presence of abuse of superior strength and craft in the commission of the crime, the heirs are also entitled to exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Appellants are also liable to the said heirs in the total amount of P63,000.00 as actual damages, the prosecution having proven that such amount was lost.  The heirs failed to prove the expenses they incurred during the wake. However, in lieu thereof, they are entitled to temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the ruling of the trial court, the heirs are not entitled to damages for the lost earnings of the victim for lack of factual basis.   The estimate given by the victim's widow on his income as a businessman is not supported by competent evidence, like income tax returns or receipts. Compensation for lost income is in the nature of damages and as such, requires due proof thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54] </sup> In short, there must be unbiased proof of the deceased's average income.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In this case, the victim's widow merely gave a self-serving statement of her deceased husband's income, hence, unreliable.<br><br>Under Article 105 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the appellants are obliged to return to the heirs the items they took from the victim, such as the Omega wristwatch and gold Cross ballpen.  However, since those lost items and valuables were already recovered from the appellants by the police investigators,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the latter should deliver them to the heirs.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Decision is AFFIRMED with  the following MODIFICATIONS:<br><ol> <li> Each appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br></li><li> Appellants are ordered to PAY, jointly and severally, the heirs of Chua the following amounts: (a) P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; (b) P50,000.00 as moral damages; (c) P63,000.00 as actual damages; (d) P25,000.00 as exemplary  damages; and (e) P25,000.00 as temperate damages.<br><br></li><li>The police are ordered to return immediately to the heirs of the victim the Omega wristwatch and gold Cross ballpen which were recovered from the appellants.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio.</i><br></li></ol>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Puno, Vitug, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio Morales, Callejo, Sr., Azcuna</i> and <i>Tinga, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Eloy R.
