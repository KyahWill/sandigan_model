				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us on automatic appeal is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Villasis, Pangasinan, Branch 50, convicting the appellant of three (3) counts of rape, and sentencing him to suffer the death penalty for each count.<br><br><center><b>The Case for the Prosecution</b></center><br>The appellant Dominador Iluis and his wife Saturnina have two daughters, namely, Noemi who was born on February 24, 1983,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and Donna who was born on September 5, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Sometime in September 1993, the appellant and Saturnina parted ways. Saturnina found employment in Baguio City, and later resided in Barangay Pulong Cacutod, Angeles City, with her common-law husband, Sauro Notarte. The appellant and his two daughters resided in Barangay Amamperez, Villasis, Pangasinan, near the house of the appellant's parents.<br><br>On October 2, 1995, at 6:30 p.m. Donna, who was then nine years old, was sleeping beside the appellant and her sister Noemi.  Donna suddenly awoke and was petrified when she saw her father tying her hands. He then forced Donna to spread her legs and got on top of her. The appellant inserted his penis into her vagina. Donna felt pain in her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Sometime that same month, Noemi, her sister Donna and their father, the appellant, were sleeping side by side.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Noemi was wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. She was shocked when she woke up and saw her father mashing her breasts and her private parts. He poked a bolo at her and threatened to kill her if she shouted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She turned to her side, in an attempt to avoid being sexually abused by her father. However, the appellant forced Noemi to lie down on her back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He then removed her shorts and her panties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> He also undressed himself, went on top of her and inserted his penis into her vagina. Noemi felt intense pain as the appellant made push-and-pull motions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Satiated, the appellant dismounted and slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>  Donna was so distraught and so angry at her father that she was unable to sleep. She could not understand why her own father would sexually abuse her. She only managed to sleep at around 5:00 a.m. When she woke up barely an hour later, the appellant was no longer in their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Noemi went to the house of her aunt, her mother's cousin Adoracion Viray, and told the latter that her father had mashed her breasts and her private parts. Noemi's vagina was so painful that she walked in a "bow-legged manner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> She did not tell her aunt that her father raped her because Noemi feared that the appellant would kill her if she did so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 2, 1996, at 3:00 p.m., Noemi was in the house of their neighbor viewing television. Donna was in their house resting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Momentarily, the appellant threw a ball at Donna. Feeling suddenly afraid, she tried to run away from the house but the appellant immediately closed the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He ordered Donna to remove her dress but she refused. He then removed her clothes himself and forced her to lie down on the floor. He   undressed himself and inserted his penis into her vagina. Donna felt excruciating pain. She opted to keep the incident to herself because she was afraid that her father might kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On August 29, 1996, Donna left her father and lived with her mother in Angeles City. Noemi followed suit on September 21, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Saturnina  noticed that her daughters were disoriented (<i>tulala</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Sensing that there was something wrong, she asked them what their problems were, but the children denied that they had any. When Saturnina persisted and asked her daughters anew, the latter merely cried and gave the same reply. Donna and Noemi later told their mother that "they did not want her to be a criminal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On September 30, 1996, Saturnina heard Donna muttering in her sleep, "You are a pig, you are a useless father," "Painful! Painful!" She saw Donna place her pillow on top of her private parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When Saturnina asked her about it, Donna finally told her mother that her father had raped her.  Noemi also revealed that her father had mashed her breasts and tried to insert his penis into her vagina. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On October 4, 1996, Saturnina, with the help of a friend, brought her two daughters to Atty. Alfredo V. Ferrer, the Legal Officer of the Commission on Human Rights, Region III. Atty. Ferrer directed Investigators Joel Bon Harris Ocampo and Ernesto Enolpe to conduct an investigation on the rape incident. The two victims gave their sworn statements to Atty. Ferrer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Dr. Mildred M. Mariano of the Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital, conducted genitalia examinations on Noemi and Donna on October 7, 1996, and issued Medical Certificates thereon. Her findings on her examination of Donna are as follows:<br><blockquote>EXTERNAL GENITALIA &amp; PERINEUM:<br><br>LABIA MAJORA:<br>LABIA MINORA:<br><br>HYMEN:        Laceration, incomplete, superficial, healed at 9 o'clock position.<br><br>LABORATORY REQUEST:<br><br>Pregnancy test - negative<br>Smear for Spermatozoa - negative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]<br><br></sup><div style="text-align: center;">. . . </div></blockquote> On her examination of Noemi's genitalia, the doctor made the following findings:<br><br><center>...</center><blockquote>HYMEN:  Laceration, incomplete, superficial, healed at 5,7 &amp; 9 o'clock positions.<br><br>PELVIC EXAM:<br>Cervix firm, closed, uterus small, adnexae negative, no bleeding.<br><br>LABORATORY REQUEST:<br><br>Pregnancy test - Negative<br>Smear for Spermatozoa -  Negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 28, 1996, Donna and Noemi filed separate criminal complaints for rape against the appellant with the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Villasis- Sto. Tomas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On May 17, 1997, an Information docketed as Criminal Case No. V-0730 was filed charging the appellant with rape, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>That during the month of October 1995, at Barangay Amamperez, Municipality of Villasis, Province of Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one Noemi Iluis y Forbile, against the latter's' will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said Noemi Iluis y Forbile.<br><br>Contrary to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]<br></sup><br></blockquote>Another Information docketed as Criminal Case No. V-0731 was filed charging the appellant with two counts of rape. The accusatory portion reads, thus:<br><blockquote>That on or about October 2, 1995 and August 2, 1996, at Barangay Amamperez, Villasis, Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have sexual intercourse with one Donna Iluis y Forbile, being below twelve (12) years old, against the latter's will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of said Donna Iluis y Forbile.<br><br>Contrary to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellant was arraigned in the said cases, assisted by counsel, and entered his respective pleas of not guilty.  A joint trial of the cases ensued.<br><br><center><b>The Defense of the Appellant</b></center><br>The appellant denied raping her daughters. He testified that he finished only Grade I and, except for his name, did not know how to read and write.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> After his marriage to Saturnina, they lived with the latter's parents in Tabor, Malasiqui, Pangasinan, for two years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29] </sup> Thereafter, he built a house for his family in Barangay Amamperez, Villasis, Pangasinan, about 300 meters away from the house of his parents, the spouses Igmidio and Basilisa Iluis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Sometime in January 1993, he and his wife parted ways. Saturnina worked for a time in Baguio City, but later became the paramour of Romeo Notarte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thereafter, his two daughters Donna and Noemi stayed with his parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> He continued residing at his house because he worked in the farmland of his brother in Villasis, Pangasinan and could not take care of his daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Every now and then, however, he visited his daughters at his parents' house and gave them money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Sometime in October 1996, Saturnina saw Barangay Captain Sergio C. Fernando, Sr. and casually told the latter about her marital problems. Saturnina apparently wanted to sell the land which she and her husband owned, but the latter had objected to this proposal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The property had been mortgaged, but Saturnina wanted to sell the property so that she and her husband could divide the proceeds of the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [36]</sup> Fernando, Sr. called the couple to a conference. Also in attendance was Igmidio, the appellant's father, who talked to the appellant about the problem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The appellant later told Fernando, Sr. that he had no objection to the sale, provided that it be done in May 1997 after the harvest of the tobacco planted on the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38] </sup> Saturnina was disheartened by the appellant's refusal to immediately sell the property.<br><br>Igmidio Iluis corroborated his son's testimony. He testified that the appellant stayed  in the house of his brother in <i>Barangay</i> Aboridos, Villasis, Pangasinan, although the appellant also stayed in his own house on Sundays, from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [39]</sup><br><br>After due trial, the trial court rendered judgment, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, based on the foregoing, the accused is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of one (1) count of rape in Criminal Case No. V-0730 and two (2) counts of rape in Criminal Case No. V-0731, and is, accordingly, hereby sentenced to suffer for each count, the extreme penalty of death, with all its accessories.<br><br>The accused is hereby further ordered to pay each of the complainants the amount of P50,000.00 for each count of rape as indemnification, P50,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The appellant assails the decision of the trial court contending that:<br><ol> <li>The trial court, Regional Trial Court, First Judicial Region, Branch 50, Villasis, Pangasinan, erred in not acquitting accused- appellant for three (3) counts of the crime of rape for failure of the prosecution to establish the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt; and<br><br></li><li>The trial court erred in not giving weight and credence to the defenses of  the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>We shall delve into and resolve the issues raised by the appellant simultaneously, as they are interrelated.<br><br>The appellant avers that the testimonies of Donna and Noemi are inconsistent with that of their mother, Saturnina.  Donna and Noemi testified that they were raped in the conjugal home of their parents, whereas, Saturnina testified that her daughters were, at the time, residing in the house of her parents- in-law, Igmidio and Basilisa Iluis. The appellant asserts that the allegation that he poked his bolo on Noemi before raping her is exaggerated; so is Donna's testimony that before she was raped, her hands were tied together and her legs forced apart.  The appellant, likewise, contends that the testimonies are incredible because although Donna claimed that her father raped her twice, first on October 2, 1995 and again on August 2, 1996, and Noemi claimed she was raped sometime in October 1995, the criminal complaints against him were filed only on October 28, 1996. The appellant further alleges that the inordinate delay in the filing of the two complaints belied his daughters' collective claims that he had raped them. According to the appellant, Saturnina was peeved by his obstinate refusal to sell their property. Because of this, Saturnina concocted the charges against him and forced her daughters to admit that their father had raped them.<br><br>The contention of the appellant does not persuade. Saturnina did not testify that her daughters were raped in the house of her parents-in-law. She is incompetent to testify on the matter as she was then residing in Angeles City with her paramour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42] </sup> Saturnina's testimony cannot prevail over the collective testimonies of Noemi and Donna that they were raped by the appellant in their house. The appellant even testified that he built a house for himself and his two daughters after Saturnina had abandoned them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Noemi's testimony that the appellant used a bolo to intimidate her, and tied Donna's hands together before forcing the latter to open her legs to facilitate the entry of his penis are not exaggerations. With Donna's hands tied, it was easier for the appellant to force her to open her legs and thus consummate the rape. Neither is it incredible that the appellant used a bolo to intimidate her daughter. It bears stressing that Donna was sleeping when the appellant raped her. The appellant had to use a bolo to intimidate her into submitting herself to his lust, so as not to give her any opportunity to awaken her sister Noemi.<br><br>It is indeed incomprehensible that a father would be capable of doing such a fiendish act to his own daughters. But this Court has held that rape is an act of depravity and lust. There is no rhyme or reason for such beastly act. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Donna and Noemi cannot be blamed for their failure to reveal their ordeal to their mother immediately or shortly after they were raped by their father. Saturnina was then living with her paramour in Angeles City. However, the very next morning, Noemi told her Aunt Adoracion Viray that the appellant had molested her. Noemi did not reveal that she was in fact raped by her father because the latter had threatened her. Noemi was afraid; in fact, she was trembling as she talked to her aunt.<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Now before October 1995 when the incident happened, have you ever experienced having something inserted in your vagina?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">None yet, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td> <div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know one by the name of Adoracion Viray? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir, she is the cousin of my mother.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td> <div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Where is Adoracion Viray residing?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div> </td> <td><div align="justify">At Amamperez, Villasis, Pangasinan, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">After that incident when it was already daytime, did you ever go somewhere else?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div> </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir, I went to that cousin of my mother.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Why did you go there?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I told her about the smashing (sic) of my breast by my father.

Noemi, on the other hand, was 12 years old when the appellant raped her.  The girls lived with their father in Barangay Amamperez, Villasis, Pangasinan, while their mother was in far away Angeles City, with her paramour. The two young victims could not possibly possess the courage to take the proper and immediate course of action against their father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Moreover, this Court has held that the filing of complaints for rape several months or even years after the commission of the offense may be justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It is not an uncommon occurrence for young and innocent girls to conceal for a time the rape committed on them because of fear of public humiliation or simply because of lack of courage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The delay in revealing the rape incidents to their mother does not imply that the charges are false.  This Court has taken judicial notice that most victims of sex crimes, especially Filipinos, are reluctant to reveal to the world their harrowing experience and prefer to bear the ignominy and the pain silently, rather than expose their shame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [49]</sup> Even after joining their mother in late 1996 in Angeles City, Saturnina noted that her daughters were not their usual selves, prompting her to inquire if something was wrong.

found the testimonies of the private complainants straightforward and unwavering, and despite the opposing counsel's grueling cross-examination, they remained steadfast in their claim that the appellant raped them.  Case law has it that the findings of facts of the trial court, the calibration of the evidence on record, the credibility and the probative weight of the testimonial evidence of the parties and its conclusions based on its findings are accorded by the appellate court high respect if not conclusive effprimapriect unless the trial court ignored, misconstrued or misinterpreted cogent facts and circumstances which, if considered, would change the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55] </sup> After a thorough review of the records, we find no basis to deviate from the trial court's conclusion that the appellant indeed raped his daughters.<br><br>The appellant's alibi, as well as his denial of the charges, deserves scant consideration. Denial is merely self-serving negative evidence. Like alibi, the appellant's denial of the crimes charged is a weak defense and cannot prevail over the positive and straightforward testimonies of Donna and Noemi. The defense of alibi is considered with suspicion because it is not only inherently weak and unreliable, but also because it can easily be fabricated and is difficult to disprove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> To prove his alibi, the appellant must adduce clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the commission of the felonies, he was in a place other than the <i>situs</i><i> criminis</i>, such that it was impossible for him to have committed the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [57]</sup>  In this case, the only evidence the appellant adduced to prove his alibi was his testimony and that of his father, Igmidio Iluis, who cannot be considered a disinterested witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The appellant failed to prove that because of the distance between his house and that of his brother, both located in Villasis, Pangasinan, it was physically impossible for him to have been in his house when his daughters were raped.<br><br><i>The Crimes Committed by <br>the Appellant and the<br>Correct Penalty Therefor</i><br><br>The trial court erred when it convicted the appellant of three counts of qualified rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7689, and sentenced him to suffer the death penalty (three counts), on its finding that Donna and Noemi were under 18 years old when they were raped by their father, the appellant.<br><br>Under Article 335, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 7659, the accused may be convicted of qualified rape and sentenced to suffer the death penalty. Thus:<br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol> <li>When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br></li></ol></blockquote>The twin circumstances of relationship of the victims and the accused and the minority of the said victims are required to be duly proved beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The same must also be alleged in the Information, as mandated by Section 8 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 8. <i>Designation of the offense</i>.-- The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances. If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it.<br></blockquote>Although this rule took effect only on December 1, 2000, long after the crimes charged were committed, it should nonetheless be applied retroactively, it being favorable to the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  Even if the prosecution proved beyond cavil the minority of the victims Noemi and Donna and their filiation with the appellant, if such circumstances were not alleged in the Information, the appellant cannot be convicted of qualified rape; otherwise, he would thereby be deprived of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature of the charges against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt the minority of the victims and their filiation with the appellant. However, the Information in Criminal Case No. V-0730 does not allege the minority of the private complainant Noemi and her filiation with the appellant; and although the Information in Criminal Case No. V-0731 alleges Donna's minority, it does not allege her filiation with the appellant. The appellant cannot thus be convicted of qualified rape in both cases.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Villasis, Pangansinan, Branch 50, is <b>AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION</b>.<br><br>In<b> Criminal Case No. V-0730</b>, the appellant Dominador Iluis y Jandoc is found guilty of one count of simple rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep.
