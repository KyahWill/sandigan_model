				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review is the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar, in Criminal Cases Nos. 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, and 1969 convicting Carlito Marahay y Moraca, accused-appellant, of five counts of rape and sentencing him to suffer death for each count, and to pay each of the victims, Belinda and Mylene Marahay, the amounts of P50,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, in each case.<br><br>Initially, on November 24, 1994, Provincial Prosecutor Romeo M. Resuello of Catarman, Northern Samar, filed with the RTC two Informations charging accused-appellant with rape, thus:<br><br>Criminal Case No. 1964<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 24<sup>th</sup> day of August, 1994, at 7:00 o’clock in the evening more or less in Sitio Pangi, Brgy.

Marahay, mother of Belinda and Mylene, filed with the same court three amended complaints, charging accused-appellant with an additional three counts of rape which read:<br><br>Criminal Case No. 1967<br><blockquote>“That on or about the 26<sup>th</sup> day of August, 1994, at more or less 3:00 o’clock in the morning at Sitio Pangi, Brgy.

Mylene and Belinda are the eldest and second eldest, respectively, of six (6) siblings. They have three (3) sisters aged ten, eight, and four and a six-year old brother. Their parents are Amalia and Carlito Marahay, the latter being the appellant himself. Mylene and Belinda live with their family in a house in Barangay Bantayan, Municipality of San Roque, Province of Northern Samar (TSN, December 5, 1994, pp. 2 and 11; December 6, 1994, pp. 8-9)<br><br>“On August 24, 1994, Mylene and Belinda accompanied appellant to their farm in Sitio Pangi where they were to make copra (TSN, December 6, 1994, pp. 7-9). At the farm, they had supper at 6:30 in the evening and went to sleep at 7:00 o’clock. They lay on the floor with the appellant between Mylene and Belinda (TSN, December 5, 1994, p. 12). Mylene awoke to find the appellant pinching her. He placed himself on top of Mylene, then kissed and embraced her while removing her shorts and panty (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 12-13). Appellant then exposed his penis from his brief and inserted it into Mylene’s organ causing her to suffer intense pain. He continued in that position until he ejaculated on the mat (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 13-15). He again placed his organ against her vagina but Mylene started to kick appellant while crying at the same time. Belinda saw what was happening and cried (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 15). Appellant turned and placed himself on top of her. He disrobed Belinda in the same manner as he did with Mylene but could only penetrate her slightly as Belinda kept on crying (TSN, December 6, 1994, pp. 5-6). So he inserted his pointing finger in her organ and made a push and pull movement with it (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 6-7). He again placed his organ inside her vagina but then pulled it out as she jerked backward in pain and cried (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 7-8). All this time appellant was pinning her arms against the floor and threatening to kill her (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 8). Nearby, Mylene just lay and cried. She could not sleep right away because of what happened (TSN, December 5, 1994, p. 16). At about 3:00 o’clock of the following morning, Mylene was again sexually assaulted by appellant (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 19). Again that evening, appellant had sexual intercourse twice with Mylene (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 19-20). Scared that they would be killed by appellant, the girls kept to themselves the ordeal they suffered (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 20). Meanwhile, appellant continued molesting Mylene everytime he saw her alone in the kitchen by touching and fondling her breast. Because of this, Mylene informed her mother Amalia of what appellant did to them at the farm (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 21).<br><br>“When Belinda was examined by the municipal health officer of San Roque, Northern Samar in the person of Dr. Warren Octadoy, she was described as having a healed laceration of the hymen located at the eleven o’clock position which may be due to sexual intercourse, among other causes (TSN, December 5, 1994, pp. 2-6). In the case of Mylene, there were noted healed hymenal lacerations located at the four, six and eight o’clock positions consistent with the insertion of a penis, according to Dr. Lydia Quilatan, acting assistant provincial health officer of the Northern Samar Provincial Hospital (TSN, Decmebr 6, 1994, pp. 10-14).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>The defense presented accused-appellant as its sole witness. He testified that his wife Amalia fabricated the rape charges against him. She constantly reproached him for not being rich and for her inability to continue working, being married to him. Their marriage is characteristically unstable due to her habitual drinking and her jealous fits. In 1982, they separated. In 1992, she reconciled with him so that he would continue to support their children. They all reside in Barangay Bantayan, San Roque, Northern Samar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On August 24, 1994, accused-appellant asked his wife to accompany him to Sitio Pangi to harvest copra. She refused, suggesting that he bring his daughters instead. Hence, Mylene and Belinda went with him to Sitio Pangi and stayed at a farmhouse for the night. While they were lying down, his daughter, Mylene, informed him that his wife has a paramour. Suddenly, he felt that his “mind became confused” and “the devil possessed him.” He claimed he “forgot all around him” and then he sexually assaulted her. Mylene said nothing and did not resist him. Accused-appellant further claimed that when they had sexual intercourse that night, “the devil possessed both of them.” The next day, or on August 25, 1994, they returned to their house in Barangay Bantayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant denied having any sexual contact with Mylene anytime thereafter since he was bothered by his conscience. He asserted that the three additional indictments of rape allegedly committed by him against Mylene were filed by his wife in order to fortify the case against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>He also denied touching or raping his other daughter, Belinda, and reiterated that such charge was concocted by his wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On January 11, 1995, the trial court rendered its Joint Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Court finds Carlito Marahay y Moraca GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape, defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 as indicated in the specifications and is hereby sentenced as follows:<br><br>“In Criminal Case No. C-1964, to suffer the extreme penalty of death and indemnify Belinda Marahay by way of moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00, respectively;<br><br>“In each Criminal Cases Nos. C-1965, C-1967, C-1968 and C-1969, to suffer the extreme penalty of death and to indemnify Mylene Marahay in the amounts of P50,000.00 and P30,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages, respectively.<br><br>“The accused shall also pay the costs hereof.<br><br>“SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant, in his brief, ascribes to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote>“…IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED FOR RAPE IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 1964 EVEN IF THE EVIDENCE RELATES TO ANOTHER CRIME.<br><br>“…IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED IN CRIMINAL CASES NOS. 1965, 1967 AND 1969 DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br>“…IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED IN CRIM. CASE NO. 1968 DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME.<br><br>“…IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF MYLENE MARAHAY AND BELINDA MARAHAY DESPITE A SHOWING THAT THEY WERE COACHED OR INFLUENCED WITNESSES.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, defines the crime of rape, as follows:<br><blockquote>“Article 335. <i>When and how rape is committed</i>. – Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><ol type="1"><li> By using force or intimidation;<br><br></li><li> When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br></li><li> When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.”<br></li></ol></blockquote>In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused in rape cases, this Court is guided by three principles: (a) an accusation of rape can be made with facility; it is difficult for the complainant to prove but more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand and fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>To recall, Criminal Cases Nos. 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 refer to four charges of rape committed by accused-appellant against his daughter, Mylene Marahay. The other criminal case (Criminal Case No. 1964) involves accused-appellant’s sexual assault on his other daughter, Belinda Marahay.<br><br>With regard to Criminal Case No. 1968, alleged to be the first rape committed by accused-appellant on August 24, 1994, Mylene testified as follows:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0"

Her positive and categorical testimony deserves credence.<br><br>Corroborating Mylene’s testimony is the accused-appellant himself, who admitted that he sexually assaulted his daughter Mylene while she laid beside him inside the farmhouse. He blamed “the devil” who “possessed” him as he took off the shorts and panty of his eldest daughter. He “forgot all around” him as he inserted his exposed penis into her vagina. He satisfied his lust on his own flesh and blood. He claims, however, that he committed this sexual atrocity only once.<br><br>Accused-appellant harps on the fact that the element of force or intimidation was not established. He contends that his daughter did not resist his sexual assault. Nor did she seek help from her sister Belinda, then sleeping nearby.<br><br>We are not persuaded. Mylene’s testimony unmistakably shows that she struggled to repel her father’s sexual advances but his strength proved too much for her. Obviously, in cases of incestuous rape, the perpetrator generally takes full advantage of his blood relationship, ascendancy, and influence over his victim, both to commit the sexual assault and to intimidate the victim into silence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The instant case is no exception. There is no question that accused-appellant exercised moral ascendancy over his daughter. Mylene at that time could not rouse her sister from sleep. Mylene also admitted that after accused-appellant raped her, she could not escape from the farmhouse as she was so frightened of him. In fact, she could not tell her mother of her ordeal, mindful of the serious threats to their lives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It was only several days later that she mustered enough courage to inform her mother of what her father did to her.<br><br>The records show that Mylene was in tears while narrating in court her father’s monstrous acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Indeed, when the victim says that she has been violated, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> No woman, especially one of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and thereafter expose herself to a public trial, if she were not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is against human nature for a girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself as well as her family to a lifetime of dishonor, especially when her charge could mean the death of her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>We disagree, however, with the trial court’s conclusion that accused-appellant must likewise be liable for the three other counts of rape against Mylene. We stress that every charge of rape is a separate and distinct crime and each must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Cases Nos. 1965 and 1969, the allegations in the informations declared that Mylene was raped on August 25, 1994, at 7:00 o’clock in the evening and at 3:00 o’clock in the morning. However, Mylene’s testimony regarding the commission of these two other felonies failed to satisfy the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt that would justify the conviction of accused-appellant.

No other detail was evoked from her to show the attendant elements that constitute rape, the crime charged. Such bare statements cannot suffice to establish accused-appellant’s guilt with the required quantum of evidence.<br><br>Worse, the prosecution utterly neglected to propound questions to prove that accused-appellant indeed raped the victim in the early morning of August 25, 1994.

If the certificate of live bright or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim’s mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;<br><br></li><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;<br><br></li><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.<br></li></ol></blockquote>“4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim’s mother or relatives concerning the victim’s age, the complainant’s testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.<br><br>“5. It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.<br><br>“6. The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.”<br></blockquote>Thus, although the defense does not contest the age of the victim, it is still essential that the prosecution present independent proof thereof, pursuant to No. 5 of said guidelines. As a matter of fact, the minority of the victim must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Under Section 44, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence, a birth certificate is the best evidence of a person’s date of birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the instant case, the prosecution did not present the certificates of live birth of both Mylene and Belinda or other similar authentic documents to prove their ages. Not even the victims’ mother or the victims themselves, or any other relative qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree, were presented by the prosecution to establish the victims’ ages at the time the crimes were committed. Such failure of the prosecution to discharge its burden constrains this Court to hold that the qualifying circumstance of minority cannot be appreciated in these cases.<br><br>In sum, accused-appellant should only be convicted of two counts of simple rape.
