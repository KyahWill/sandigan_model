				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review by this Court is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 15, of Cebu City, dated June 27, 2001, in Criminal Case No. CBU-50105, finding the appellant Melchor Rabago guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the court finds accused, Melchor Rabago <b>GUILTY</b> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as defined by Article 266-A and penalized by Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Republic Act 8353 and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the mandatory penalty of DEATH. The accused is further ordered to pay the victim, Merliza Rabago, the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>On March 30, 1999, appellant was charged under an information which states:<br><blockquote>That on the 13<sup>th</sup> day of January, 1999, at about 7:00 o’clock in the evening, at Sitio Lubas, Barangay Camp 7, Municipality of Minglanilla, Province of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeed in having carnal knowledge with his own daughter Merliza Rabago, a minor who is only thirteen (13) years old, against her will and consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon his arraignment on July 13, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> appellant, assisted by his counsel, Atty. Anacleto Debalucos, pleaded not guilty. After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered the assailed decision.<br><br>The testimonies of three witnesses for the prosecution, namely the complainant Merliza Rabago, her mother Esterlita Rabago, and Dr. Daphne Rana, were presented to establish the following facts:<br><br>Merliza Rabago is the only daughter among the eight children of appellant Melchor Rabago and Esterlita Rabago.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On the date of the alleged rape, she was residing with her family in Lubas II, Campo 7, Minglanilla, Cebu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On January 13, 1999, at around 9:00 p.m., while sleeping on the floor of their house with her 4-month old brother, the complainant was awakened when appellant covered her mouth with his hands, undressed her, and took off her panty. Appellant touched her body starting from the neck, left breast, stomach area, going downwards to her thighs. Appellant, already naked then, rubbed his penis on the complainant’s vagina. He raised her right leg and thereafter made a push-and-pull movement, with his penis inside her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The complainant struggled and tried to extricate herself, but appellant proved too strong for her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She felt pain and noticed that blood dripped from her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> When appellant was through, he left to change. Upon returning, he threatened the complainant with a knife, telling her that he would kill her mother and her brothers if she reports to her mother what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On January 22, 1999, eight days after the incident, the complainant eventually told her mother what happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> They immediately reported the occurrence to the Office of the Barangay Captain, which then reported the same to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The next day, Merliza was examined by Dr. Nueva Tagaloguin, Medico-Legal Officer of Don Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center. The Medical Report indicated a healed laceration in Merliza’s hymen at the 3 o’clock and 9 o’clock positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The evidence for the defense is the lone testimony of appellant, who claims innocence of the accusation of his daughter against him. He testified that on January 13, 1999, he was working in his farm from morning until afternoon. He arrived home at 7:00 p.m. and ate supper with his wife and children at 9:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., he and his family all went to sleep on the floor of their one-room house. He denies having raped his daughter Merliza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The trial court gave credence to the young complainant’s testimony, which it observed to be “sincere, straightforward and forthright.” It ruled that the minor inconsistencies in her testimony such as the variances in the time of rape did not impair the veracity of her declarations. It upheld the evidence presented to prove the minority of the complainant and the latter’s relationship to appellant. It dismissed appellant’s bare denial as a mere afterthought, manifestly outweighed by the complainant’s clear and positive testimony. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In his lone assignment of error, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and in sentencing him to the penalty of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In reviewing rape cases, we are guided by the following principles: (1) to accuse a man of rape is easy but to disprove it is difficult although the accused may be innocent; (2) considering the nature of things, and that only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>At the heart of almost all rape cases is the issue of credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> And when credibility is in issue, it is well settled that we generally defer to the findings of the trial court. Having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment during trial, the trial court is in a better position to decide the question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the present case, we find no material discrepancy in the testimony of the complainant that would seriously taint her credibility and warrant a reversal of the trial court’s findings. The complainant tearfully narrated her traumatic ordeal on that fateful night of January 13, 1999, as follows:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td width="6%"> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td style="text-align: center;" width="94%"><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify">You said you slept at about 7:00 o’clock in the evening of January 13, 1999, were you awaken[ed] [at] any time while you were [asleep]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">I was awaken[ed] at about 9:00 o’clock in the evening, when my father undressed me and then covered my mouth with his hands.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td style="text-align: center;"><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify">Were you wearing your panty when you [went] to sleep that night?</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, [S]ir.</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What happened to your panty?</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">He removed it.</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify">After he undressed you by removing your panty and covering your mouth with his hands, what next did he do to you?</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">He kept on touching my body.</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What part of your body did he touch?</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td style="text-align: center;"><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">From the neck to the left breast going to the stomach and going down.</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td style="text-align: center;"><div align="center">xxx xxx xxx</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">After he touched your lower inner thigh, what happened next?</div></td> </tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">He was already naked during that time and then he rubbed his penis to my vagina.

complainant strongly establishes, beyond doubt, the fact of rape and the identity of appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.<br><br>It bears emphasis that the complainant was only fourteen years old when she testified. A young girl’s revelation that she has been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and her willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as a mere concoction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In the case at bar, the complainant remained steadfast throughout her entire testimony in the face of intense and lengthy interrogation. Moreover, the fact that, as shown by the records, she cried while at the witness stand<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> further bolsters the credibility of the rape charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, we take cognizance of our holding that the testimony of a rape victim against her father is entitled to great weight, since reverence and respect for elders is deeply ingrained in Filipino children and is also recognized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It is against human nature for a girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself as well as her family to a lifetime of dishonor, especially when her charge could mean the death of her own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>We note that the variances in the complainant’s testimony as to the time of the rape<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> are but minor inconsistencies. We have ruled on numerous occasions that minor inconsistencies in rape cases will not necessarily derail the testimony of the offended party, for rape victims cannot be expected to be precise in recounting the details of a clearly harrowing experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As long as the testimony is consistent on material points, slightly conflicting statements will not undermine the witness’ credibility nor the veracity of the testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Besides, specification of the exact time of the commission of rape is not important, as it is not an element of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The complainant’s testimony is, moreover, supported by the medical examination on the complainant conducted by a medico-legal officer ten days after the incident. The medical report showed healed lacerations in the complainant’s hymen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Laceration, whether healed or fresh, is the best physical evidence of forcible defloration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It is settled that when the victim’s claim of rape is corroborated by the physical findings of penetration, there exists sufficient basis for concluding that sexual intercourse did take place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Against the foregoing evidence of the prosecution, which the trial court found convincing beyond doubt, appellant interposed the defense of denial. His testimony stating that nothing out of the ordinary happened on January 13, 1999 was unsubstantiated by any independent evidence. A plain denial, which is a negative self-serving evidence, cannot stand against the positive identification and categorical testimony of a rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Hence appellant’s weak defense of denial fails in light of the complainant’s positive declarations.<br><br>In his brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> appellant asserts that the prosecution failed to prove with sufficiency the existence of force, threat or intimidation, as required by the first paragraph of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Appellant, in the main, argues that he could not be convicted for rape as the prosecution fatally erred in not proving his moral ascendancy over the complainant, hence failing to prove the presence of intimidation. Appellant heavily relies on the case of <i>People v. Alberto Chua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> where we said:<br><blockquote>The mere fact that appellant is her father and therefore exercises moral ascendancy over his daughter cannot <i>ipso facto</i> lead this Court to conclude that there was intimidation. There must be some evidence of the intimidation employed on the victim as to indubitably show how vitiated the victim’s consent was to the violation of her womanhood.<br></blockquote>Reliance on this case, however, is misplaced since the factual background of the present case differs from that of the said decision. In Chua, there was the burden of proving the presence of intimidation to establish the crime of rape, as the complainant herself testified that no force or violence was employed by the accused. On the other hand, in the instant case, the existence of intimidation need not be proven, as the prosecution’s evidence sufficiently established the presence of force.<br><br>Contrary to appellant’s allegation that the complainant never resisted the sexual assault, the presence of force is unmistakably established, as shown by the complainant’s unwavering stance during her cross-examination, thus:<br><br><table width="75%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td width="6%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td width="94%"><div align="justify">At that very moment when you noticed that somebody was touching you, you did not bother to shout?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">No, because he held my neck and then covered my mouth.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify">You did not also attempt to kick that somebody who allegedly raped you?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">No Sir, but he held my hands and placed [them] at my back[,] and he also tied my feet.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify">When somebody held your hands and also your feet, did you not bother to shout at that time considering that his hand was not covering your mouth [anymore]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">No more, because he tied my mouth with a rag.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td><td> <div align="justify"><br> </div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td><td><div align="justify">You did not also attempt even to wiggle your body so as to awaken your brothers and also your mother at that time?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top" bgcolor="#ffffff"><td><div align="justify">A:</div></td><td><div align="justify">I was not able to move[,] Sir[,] because he pinned me in the corner of our house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></div></td> </tr></tbody></table><br>Clearly, the foregoing shows appellant’s employment of force and violence to satiate his bestial lust. Also, in the complainant’s direct examination, she testified that she tried to extricate herself from appellant, but he proved too strong for her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Hence, given the sufficient proof of the presence of force in the case at bar, the element of “force, threat or intimidation,” as required by Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, is satisfactorily established. The rape charge thus stands without need of further proving the presence of intimidation.<br><br>Having established the fact of carnal knowledge through force, we now proceed to determine the proper penalty. Paragraph 6 of Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, provides:<br><blockquote><center>xxx                        xxx                         xxx</center><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br><center><br>xxx                         xxx                        xxx<br></center></blockquote>Under this provision, both circumstances of the victim’s minority and her relationship to the offender must be alleged in the information and proven during the trial to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The complainant’s minority was not only confirmed by her mother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and admitted by appellant in court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> but was also established by her birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> issued by the Municipal Civil Registrar of Minglanilla, Cebu. Said document clearly states that the complainant was born on July 18, 1985.
