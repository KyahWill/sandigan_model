				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>An Information for homicide was filed on March 1, 1985 against Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay, Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr., a certain Toti Amiscosa and one John Doe before the Regional Trial Court of Tagaytay City, Branch XVIII. The Information reads:<br><blockquote> “That on or about December 26, 1981, in the Municipality of Silang, Province of Cavite, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused together with “Alias” TOTI AMISCOSA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and one John Doe, the latter two accused’s real identities are still unknown and who are still at-large, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping and assisting one another, with intent to kill being then armed with a firearm, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, assault, attack and shoot with the said firearm the person of one RONALDO MONTOYA y RAMOS, thereby hitting the latter in the body which caused his subsequent death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said Ronaldo R. Montoya.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>On July 30, 1985, Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr., assisted by their counsel de parte, pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Cesar “Toti” Amiscosa and John Doe remained at large.<br><br>After trial, Judge Julieto P. Tabiolo rendered a decision on February 7, 1990, finding Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. guilty as charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote> “WHEREFORE, based on the evidence as adduced, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">EDGARDO MAIGUE, <br>EDDIE TALAY <br>and BAYANI TALAY<br></div><br>GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt, of the crime of HOMICIDE, as provided for and penalized under Art. 249 of the Revised Penal Code and as charged against them in the Information and taking into account the benign provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, of which accused are deserving, the Court hereby sentences them to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">EIGHT (8) years, SIX (6) months &amp; ONE (1) day of prision mayor, as MINIMUM<br><br></div><center style="margin-left: 40px;">- to -<br></center><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>SIXTEEN (16) years, SIX (6) months &amp; ONE (1) day of reclusion temporal, as MAXIMUM.<br></div><br>Further, they are hereby ordered to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of the late RONALDO MONTOYA, the following: <br><br> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><br></td><td width="10%">(1)</td> <td width="85%"> <div align="justify">P50,000.00 - for moral damages to compensate the heirs for the excruciating moral pain and anguish that they suffered as a result of the death of their son;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(2)</td> <td> <div align="justify">P50,000.00 - for exemplary damages;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td> <td>(3)</td> <td> <div align="justify">P40,000.00 - as reimbursement for expenses incurred as a result of the death of Ronaldo Montoya; <br></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>and to pay the costs of this proceedings (sic).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote>Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. appealed to the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which affirmed with modification the trial court’s decision. In its decision dated May 31, 1994, the Court of Appeals ruled:<br><blockquote> “WHEREFORE, finding no reversible error in the appealed decision, the same is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification that in lieu of the exemplary damages awarded therein which is hereby deleted, the three (3) accused-appellants are hereby ordered to pay, jointly and severally, the heirs of the late Rolando<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Montoya the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity in accordance with the prevailing jurisprudence. Costs against the appellants.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this petition for review filed by Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. (collectively “petitioners,” for brevity).<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>There is no dispute that Ronaldo Montoya was shot twice with a handgun on December 26, 1981 at around 6:30 o’clock in the evening near the store of one Marina Castillo. Ronaldo Montoya died because of two gunshot wounds. The prosecution pointed to Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr., Cesar “Toti” Amiscosa and an unidentified companion of their group as co-principals in a conspiracy to kill the victim. On the other hand, the defense pointed to an unknown and unidentified man as the one who pulled the trigger twice on Ronaldo Montoya.<br><br><center><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br></center><br>The prosecution presented seven witnesses. Marina Castillo, a storeowner, Ramoncito Ramos, the victim’s companion during the shooting, Nieto Toledo, son of the barangay captain, and Oscar Montoya, father of the victim, who were all at the scene of the crime when the shooting occurred, gave their eyewitness accounts. Dr. Engracia dela Cruz testified on the results of the autopsy, policeman Rodelo Sumadsad testified that he investigated the incident and took down the statements of several witnesses, while barangay captain Rodrigo Toledo testified that he saw Ronaldo Montoya wounded.<br><br>As culled from the testimonies of its witnesses, the prosecution established that at about 6:30 o’clock in the evening of December 26, 1981, the victim Ronaldo Montoya and Ramoncito Ramos were at the store of Marina Castillo drinking soft drinks. Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. and their two other companions arrived at the store. Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. suddenly boxed Ronaldo Montoya and Ramoncito Ramos. Bayani Talay and Cesar “Toti” Amiscosa joined in mauling Ronaldo Montoya and Ramoncito Ramos, forcing the two to run away. Ronaldo Montoya ran towards the house of barangay captain Rodrigo Toledo. Upon reaching the barangay captain’s house, Ronaldo Montoya reported to him that he was “<i>kinukursunadahan at pinagsusuntok.</i>” Ronaldo Montoya, barangay captain Toledo and his son, Nieto Toledo, proceeded to the scene of the incident. Ronaldo Montoya pointed to the group of Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. as the ones who earlier boxed him and Ramoncito Ramos. Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. then shouted to Eddie Talay, “Barilin na iyan!” Eddie Talay shot the victim with a .45 caliber pistol. Thereafter, the group of Eddie Talay fled and disappeared. Ronaldo Montoya was rushed to the Velasco Hospital in Silang, Cavite, where he was declared dead, on arrival.<br><br>Initially, a complaint for murder was filed on December 29, 1981 against petitioners. On December 13, 1984, a complaint for homicide was filed in lieu of murder. Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. resurfaced three years after the incident, or in December of 1984, to post bail before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Silang-Amadeo, Cavite.<br><br><center><i><b>Version of the Defense</b></i><br></center><br>The defense presented four witnesses. Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. narrated that they were on their way to the house of one Nelson Belardo when they stopped by the store of Marina Castillo. Eddie Maigue, Jr. bought cigarettes at the store. They suddenly saw a man approach and box Ronaldo Montoya. There was a commotion and a rumble ensued. Eddie Talay tried to pacify the group. Ronaldo Montoya ran away and returned with barangay captain Rodrigo Toledo and the latter’s son, Nieto Toledo. Ronaldo Montoya pointed to the man who boxed him, at which point, the man shot Ronaldo Montoya with a gun. Their version that an unknown assailant shot Ronaldo Montoya was corroborated by Benjamin Arcilla.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court of Appeals’ Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The Court of Appeals found that the trial court correctly gave credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. The Court of Appeals noted that the inconsistencies pointed out by the defense in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses referred to trivial matters that did not affect their credibility. It also noted that slight differences in the recollection of the prosecution witnesses of the details relating to the incident may be expected since some of them testified more than six years after the shooting occurred. The Court of Appeals ruled that the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses of Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr. as the assailants of Ronaldo Montoya rests on solid foundation as their eyewitness accounts were consistent.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also agreed with the trial court that the conduct of Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo “Eddie” Maigue, Jr., before, during and after the commission of the crime, established a series of acts done in conspiracy to pursue a common unlawful purpose.<br><br><center><b><u>The Assigned Errors</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioners fault the Court of Appeals for (1) taking into account the testimony of prosecution witness Marina Castillo which was stricken off the record; (2) giving credence to the testimony of prosecution witness Ramoncito Ramos despite the finding of the trial court that he was a liar; and (3) not taking into account through oversight the testimony of defense witness Benjamin Arcilla.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>The merits of the defense’s petition hinge on the credibility of witnesses. The Court, however, has invariably relied upon, and accorded the highest respect for, the findings of fact of trial courts. This is particularly true when what is at issue is the credibility of witnesses. No departure from this principle and practice is warranted by petitioners’ arguments in this case.<br><br><i><b>Credibility of Prosecution Witnesses</b></i><br><br>First, petitioners argue that since Marina Castillo’s testimony as the principal witness for the prosecution was stricken off the record by the trial court’s order of May 5, 1988,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the other prosecution witnesses’ testimonies which merely corroborate Marina’s testimony no longer have any leg to stand on. Second, petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals should not have given credence to the testimony of Ramoncito Ramos after the trial court found him to be a liar. Third, they also fault the Court of Appeals for not considering the testimony of defense witness Benjamin Arcilla to exculpate them.<br><br>While it is true that Marina Castillo’s testimony was stricken off the record, she is not, as the defense argues, the prosecution’s principal witness. Her testimony is not indispensable to secure the conviction of petitioners.<br><br>The consistent and unequivocal eyewitness accounts of the other prosecution witnesses, namely Ramoncito Ramos, Nieto Toledo, and Oscar Montoya, suffice to meet the degree of proof required by the Constitution and the law to validate a conviction. The testimony of Ramoncito Ramos showed this, thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">“ATTY.

On the whole, his testimony as to who mauled and eventually killed Ronaldo Montoya was consistent and believable. Perfect recall and a flawless testimony cannot be expected from a witness who is testifying almost six years after the event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> During his cross-examination, he clarified this matter by categorically confirming that only Eddie Maigue boxed him. If at all, this portion of his testimony was a minor lapse that does not necessarily make him a liar. Moreover, the Court of Appeals correctly held that the testimony of a witness may be believed in part and disbelieved in part, as the corroborative evidence or improbability of the case may require. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>It would have been highly unnatural for the third eyewitness, Oscar Montoya, as the father of Ronaldo Montoya, to accuse persons other than the real culprits since the father’s interest is to punish only the guilty and not innocent persons. A father’s quest for justice for his son’s death would deter him from implicating innocent persons, as his natural interest would be to secure the conviction of the real culprits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Also futile is petitioners’ claim that the courts a quo grievously erred in failing to consider, through oversight, the testimony of defense witness Benjamin Arcilla. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals did not overlook Benjamin Arcilla’s testimony. On the contrary, the Court of Appeals sustained the trial court’s assessment that Benjamin Arcilla’s testimony is unworthy of belief. Indeed, Benjamin Arcilla’s testimony corroborating petitioners’ denial and supporting petitioners’ claim that a stranger shot Ronaldo Montoya flies in the face of the positive identification by not one but three prosecution witnesses.<br><br>Positive identification, where categorical and consistent and without any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness, prevails over denial which if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence is self-serving evidence undeserving of weight in law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The defense denial is unavailing when placed astride the undisputed fact that there is positive identification of the felon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Like alibi, denial is an inherently weak defense and crumbles before positive declarations of truthful witnesses who testified that the culprits were at the scene of the incident and were the assailants of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court sees no reason to disturb the courts a quo’s evaluation an assessment of the credibility of witnesses. We reiterate the familiar and well-entrenched rule that in assessing the credibility of witnesses, the factual findings of the trial court should be respected. The judge a quo was in a better position to pass judgment on the credibility of witnesses, having personally heard them when they testified and observed their deportment and manner of testifying.<br><br><b><i>Conspiracy was sufficiently Proved</i></b><br><br>We are also agree with the courts a quo that the evidence on record shows the existence of conspiracy in the killing of Ronaldo Montoya. A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Similar to the physical act constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup> In a conspiracy, it is not necessary to show that all the conspirators actually hit and killed the victim. What is important is that all the participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to unmistakably indicate a common purpose or design to bring about the death of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>From the chain of circumstances established by the prosecution, it is clear that Eddie Talay, Bayani Talay and Edgardo Maigue, Jr. acted in concert in the pursuit of their unlawful design. They were together from the time they arrived at the store of Marina Castillo up to the time of the actual shooting. The mauling incident involved all of them. After the shooting, they all fled together and resurfaced only after three years to post bail. There being a conspiracy in the killing of Ronaldo Montoya, each one of them is guilty as principal perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><i><b>Penalty and Civil Liability</b></i><br><br>Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for homicide is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.
