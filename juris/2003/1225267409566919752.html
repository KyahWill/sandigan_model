				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is an appeal from the decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 17, 1997, of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (Branch 102) convicting accused Dionisio Jackson of rape in Criminal Case No. Q-96-66112, sentencing him to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P50,000.00.<br><br>In a Complaint dated May 15, 1996, twelve-year old AAA, assisted by her father <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Delfin del Valle y Alcantara</span>, accused Dionisio Jackson of rape, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 5<sup>th</sup> day of May 1996, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously drag the complainant, one AAA, a minor 12 years of age, inside a bathroom, and then and there, undressing her and thereafter put himself on top of her, and had carnal knowledge of her, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the said offended party.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned on July 8, 1996, the accused pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>At the ensuing trial, the prosecution presented the complainant AAA and six other witnesses, namely: <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Irenea Alcantara</span>, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Delfin del Valle</span>, Dr. Jesusa Nieves-Vergara, Carmen Sunico-Quesada, PO1 Ernesto Albero and Dr. Pablo Reyes.<br><br>The prosecution evidence established the following facts:<br><br>At around 8:00 p.m. of May 4, 1996, accused Jackson and six other male companions were having a drinking session at the back of the house of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Erlinda del Valle</span> at 338 Marian Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City.&nbsp; Waiting on them was <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Erlinda's</span> granddaughter, twelve-year old AAA who collected the empty liquor bottles.&nbsp; At around 1:00 a.m. of May 5, 1996, the accused invited AAA to the comfort room, which is located a few meters outside of the house of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Erlinda</span>.&nbsp; When AAA and the accused were near the comfort room, the accused dragged AAA inside the comfort room.&nbsp; The accused punched her, then pushed her down to the cemented floor where she hit her head.&nbsp; A rope was tied on her neck and her hands.&nbsp; When accused saw that AAA could not breathe, he removed the rope around her neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; While she lay on the floor, the accused lowered her short pants, straddled ("sinakyan") her and then inserted his penis inside her vagina.&nbsp; AAA felt pain but she did not shout because the accused warned her not to shout or else she would be beheaded.&nbsp; After the rape, AAA pulled the rope from her hands, pulled up her short pants and placed the rope on the side of the comfort room.&nbsp; She then returned to where the drinking session was going on and waited for the empty liquor bottles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Six days later, on May 11, 1996, AAA went to <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Irenea Alcantara</span>, her grand-aunt, who lived a few meters from her grandmother's house.&nbsp; AAA told <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Irenea</span> that the accused inserted his penis inside her vagina.&nbsp; Upon hearing this, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Irenea</span> called AAA's father, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Delfin del Valle</span>.&nbsp; <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Delfin del Valle</span> brought AAA to the Barangay but they were referred to the Quezon City General Hospital.&nbsp; The hospital, in turn, referred them to Camp Crame for medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On May 11, 1996, Dr. Jesusa Nieves-Vergara, a medico-legal officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory in Camp Crame, conducted a medico-legal examination on AAA.&nbsp; She found the "hymen with shallow healed lacerations at 2, 5, and 10 o'clock positions."&nbsp; Dr. Vergara concluded that AAA is in a "non-virgin state physically."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; On May 13, 1996, AAA and her father went to the Novaliches Police Station where PO1 Ernesto Albero took their sworn statements, on the basis of which a criminal complaint for rape was filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>AAA was brought to the Psychiatric Department of the Quezon City General Hospital. The Psychiatric Department referred AAA to Carmen Sunico-Quesada, a child psychologist at the Child Development Unit-Pediatrics Department of the Quezon City General Hospital, for psychiatric examination.&nbsp; The psychiatric examination revealed that AAA has an I.Q. of 52 which is "comparatively fit for an average 6 year old girl".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The psychiatric findings of Carmen Sunico-Quesada were affirmed by Dr. Pablo Reyes, a Physician-Psychiatrist of the Quezon City General Hospital, who also examined AAA.&nbsp; Dr. Reyes added that AAA is suffering from "mild mental retardation".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The evidence for the defense consisted of denial and alibi.&nbsp; The witnesses for the defense were <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Erlinda del Valle</span>, accused Dionisio Jackson, Francisco Leysis and Agustina Calvero.<br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Erlinda del Valle</span> testified: She is AAA's grandmother.&nbsp; AAA lives with her.&nbsp; She knew the accused who formerly rented a room in her house.&nbsp; On May 4, 1996, she did not see the accused because he went to work.&nbsp; On May 5, 1996, he arrived in the afternoon and had a drinking spree.&nbsp; When she woke up on May 5, 1996, she did not notice any contusions on the face of AAA.&nbsp; AAA did not narrate to her the alleged rape but she learned about it from his son, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Delfin del Valle</span>.&nbsp; The comfort room does not have a light and it is dark inside, that at nighttime, she cannot see who is inside or outside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>For his part, the accused testified: On May 4, 1996, he went to work at Isuzu Sales Phils., Inc. located at Caloocan City and left the office at about 5:30 p.m. and proceeded to his residence at San Francisco Compound, Tandang Sora Extension, Quezon City.&nbsp; He arrived home at about 8:00 p.m. and after he took his supper at around 9:00 p.m., he rested for a while listening to music till he fell asleep.&nbsp; He woke up at about 5:00 o'clock the following morning of May 5, 1996 and washed his clothes before he took his breakfast.&nbsp; Then, he rested for a while before he took his lunch together with his companions in the house.&nbsp; He learned of the criminal accusation of rape against him only when his sister, Editha Jackson, called him up on May 11, 1996 at around 12:30 noon at his office at Isuzu Sales Phils., Inc. and told him that their father, Emiliano Jackson, wanted to talk to him about the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Francisco Leysis testified: He was the companion of the accused in the house at 259 Tandang Sora Extension, Sangandaan, Quezon City.&nbsp; On May 4, 1996, accused arrived at the house at 8:00 p.m. and he saw the accused asleep at around 1:00 a.m. of May 5, 1996 when the alleged rape took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Agustina Calvero testified: She has been a co-worker of the accused for thirteen years in Isuzu Sales Phils., Inc.&nbsp; She is the timekeeper of the company.&nbsp; Based on her notebook, the accused reported to work on May 4, 1996 from 8:25 a.m. until 5:30 p.m.&nbsp; Accused is a good family man and has no derogatory record at work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The prosecution presented Mario Bojo as rebuttal witness.&nbsp; He testified that he saw the accused on the evening of May 4, 1996 at Marian Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After evaluating the evidence adduced by the opposing parties, the trial court rendered judgment convicting the accused of the crime of rape.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court Finds the accused Dionisio Jackson guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and to indemnify the complainant in the amount of P50,000.00<br><br>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Accused did not file a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Instead, he interposed the present appeal to this Court.<br><br>In his Brief, appellant bewails the decision of the trial court and submits the following Assignment of Errors:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT, AAA WAS PUNCTURED WITH MATERIAL IMPROBABILITY, CONTRADICTION AND UNRELIABILITY THEREBY CASTING DOUBT ON THE CRIMINAL CULPABILITY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRESENCE OF EXCULPATORY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE SAME.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>Anent the first assigned error, appellant argues that the trial court "reluctantly" gave weight and credence to the testimony of AAA notwithstanding that the trial court itself acknowledged in its Decision that AAA "gave a somewhat confused testimony". He points to contradictory statements which escaped the proper appreciation of the trial court, namely: (a) to whom and when did she report the crime; (b) when did the crime happen, on a Saturday or a day that televised basketball is shown; (c) was she sleeping when the crime happened; and, (d) how was force exerted on her.<br><br>As to the second assigned error, he claims that the alleged rape could not have occurred on May 5, 1996 since the medico-legal officer, Dr. Vergara, on cross-examination, revealed that the lacerations in the hymen of AAA could have been inflicted or could have occurred more than seven days prior to the date of examination on May 11, 1996.<br><br>We have held time after time that factual findings of the trial court, especially on the credibility of witnesses, are accorded great weight and respect and will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This is so because the trial court has the advantage of observing the witnesses through the different indicators of truthfulness or falsehood, such as the angry flush of an insisted assertion, the sudden pallor of a discovered lie, the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer, or the forthright tone of a ready reply; the furtive glance, the blush of conscious shame, the hesitation, the yawn, the sigh,&nbsp; the candor or lack of it, the scant or full realization of the solemnity of an oath, the carriage and mien.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Only when there appears in the record some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated and which, if properly considered, would have altered the results of the case, will we depart from this rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The appeal is without merit. A close and detailed examination of the entire record of the instant case impels us to affirm the assailed decision of the RTC.<br><br>The trial court indeed had observed that AAA gave a "somewhat confused testimony".&nbsp; However, it attributed her manner of testifying to the fact that she was suffering from mental deficiency — "mild mental retardation". Significantly, when the matter of AAA's mental retardation cropped up at the trial, the appellant did not challenge her competence as a witness and ability to testify in court.&nbsp; Indeed, we find no reason to doubt her competency. Even a mental retardate could qualify as a competent witness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> for as long as, she could perceive and is capable of making known her perception to others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; It has long been settled that a person should not be disqualified on the basis of mental handicap alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; He or she can be a witness, depending on his or her ability to relate what he or she knows. If the testimony of a mental retardate is coherent, the same is admissible in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Despite her mental retardation, we agree with the trial court that AAA adequately showed she could convey her ideas by words and could give sufficiently intelligent answers to the questions propounded by her counsel, the counsel for the defense and the court.&nbsp; Enlightening are the following excerpts from her candid and unequivocal testimony which we quote verbatim:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top">Q: </td> <td width="90%">Who is that person whom you said who raped you?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Diony, `yan'.

Said contradiction is inconsequential considering that it refers to a trivial detail which has nothing to do with the essential fact of the commission of the crime of rape, that is, carnal knowledge through force or intimidation.&nbsp; A rape victim, especially a mental retardate, cannot be expected to mechanically keep and then give an accurate account of the traumatic and horrifying experience she had undergone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Truly, AAA's failure to give a perfect and flawless account of every grisly detail of the crime for which she seeks retribution should not be taken against her.<br><br>With respect to the physical evidence of lacerations on the hymen of AAA, Dr. Vergara testified that the lacerations could have been inflicted or could have occurred more than seven days prior to the date of examination on May 11, 1996, or on May 3, 1996 or earlier. However, such testimony does not help the defense since Dr. Vergara did not foreclose that the rape did not occur. She merely assessed the probability of the date of its occurrence.&nbsp; She also stated that the laceration could have been inflicted less than seven days prior to the examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Besides, it bears stressing that, in cases of rape, the date of commission is not an essential element of the offense, what is material being the occurrence thereof and not the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Appellant's defense of alibi, although corroborated by two witnesses, has no merit.&nbsp; His alibi fails in the light of the positive and unequivocal declaration of AAA.&nbsp; It is an oft-quoted doctrine that positive identification prevails over denial and alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; Furthermore, for the defense of alibi to prosper, the appellant must establish that (a) he was in another place at the time of the commission of the offense; and (b) he was so far away that he could not have been physically present at the place of the crime, or its immediate vicinity, at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Appellant failed to establish both requirements.&nbsp; Aside from the testimony of AAA, the clear and categorical testimony of rebuttal witness Mario Bojo established that appellant was at the scene of the incident on May 4, 1996.&nbsp; The defense failed to show Bojo had any motive to falsely testify against the appellant.&nbsp; When there is no evidence to indicate that the prosecution witnesses were actuated by improper motives, the presumption is that they were not so actuated and that their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Appellant's conviction was based on the positive and direct testimony of AAA.&nbsp; The absence of evidence of any improper motive on her part to testify as principal witness of the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive existed at the time she testified and her testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp;

When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and</ol></blockquote>When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br>We note that the trial court convicted the appellant of rape without specifying under which paragraph of Article 335 was the crime committed. &nbsp;<br><br>Sexual intercourse with a woman who is a mental retardate constitutes statutory rape, which does not require proof that the accused used force or intimidation in having carnal knowledge of the victim for conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp;

The prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that appellant used force and intimidation in committing the crime of rape in this case.&nbsp; AAA's testimony sufficiently demonstrated that the sexual act was forced on her as she was dragged to the comfort room, punched, pushed down to the cemented floor, tied with a rope around her neck and both hands, and was warned not to shout or else she will be beheaded.<br><br>Indeed, appellant is guilty of rape, under paragraph 1, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code which is punishable with the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. &nbsp;<br><br>There are no aggravating or mitigating circumstances.<br><br>With respect to the civil liability of appellant, the trial court correctly awarded to the offended party the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.&nbsp;
