Accordingly, the PARAD Decision dated December 3, 1997 is ordered REINSTATED. "<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>The assailed Resolution, on the other hand, denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></div><br>The facts of the case are narrated by the CA as follows:<br><blockquote> "[Respondent] Eduardo Reyes was the administrator of the landholdings previously owned by his parents, Spouses Leopoldo and Dolores Reyes.&nbsp; The subject landholding, approximately four (4) hectares, situated in Bayate, Liliw, Laguna, was one of those he administered.&nbsp; When the heirs of Sps. Reyes partitioned the landholdings, only 2.7 hectares was adjudicated to Atty. Reyes excluding the subject land.<br><br>"When [respondent] took over the administration of the subject land, a `<i>patao'</i> named Juana Montalbo was staying therein who was specifically tasked to prevent the entry of intruders and thieves of coconuts.&nbsp; As such `<i>patao'</i>, she received 20% share of the net harvest as compensation.&nbsp; In 1971, Juana Montalbo who was then old and could no longer perform as `<i>patao'</i>, recommended [Petitioner] Faustino Esquibel.&nbsp; [Respondent] acceded and gave him the same compensation that Juana Montalbo used to receive.&nbsp; [Petitioner] was not, in any way, involved in the cultivation of the land, as the plucking of coconuts was done by `<i>magkakawit',</i> the gathering of fallen nuts was done by `<i>magsisimot'</i>, the husking of the nuts was done by `<i>magtatapas'</i>, and the transportation of nuts on horseback or by carabao-drawn sleds was done by `<i>maghahakot'</i> or `<i>maghihila',</i> all separately paid for by the [respondent].<br><br>"In 1995, [petitioner] went to the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of Nagcarlan, Laguna, and requested the execution of a leasehold contract including his share in the lanzones harvest.&nbsp; [Respondent] Eduardo Reyes vehemently denied the existence of a tenancy relationship with [petitioner].<br><br>"In the meantime, [Respondent] Reyes learned that [petitioner] has abandoned the subject landholding as he and his family moved in Barangay Sta. Lucia, Nagcarlan, Laguna.&nbsp; [Respondent] then stopped paying [petitioner] the usual 20% of the net proceeds of the coconut harvest.<br><br>"However, in one of the conferences with the MARO, [respondent] offered to sell the subject land to [petitioner] but the latter was adamant.<br><br>"On April 8, 1997, [petitioner] filed a complaint against [respondent] for `Illegal Withholding of Shares; Maintenance of Peaceful Possession and Execution of Leasehold Tenancy Contract' with the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD). Accordingly, on December 3, 1997, the PARAD dismissed the said complaint in its Decision `<i>1. (F)inding the contract between Complainant Faustino Esquibel and Defendant Eduardo Reyes not one Agricultural Share Tenancy but a contract for services paid on commission basis; 2.&nbsp; Finding and declaring Complainant Faustino Esquibel not an agricultural share tenant de jure but a security services contractee paid on commission basis, hence, not entitled to security of tenure and shares in the produce of the subject landholding; x x x.'</i><br><br>"On appeal, the DARAB reversed the decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br>`WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing premises, the appealed decision dated December 3, 1997 is hereby SET ASIDE and a new judgment is hereby rendered:<br><blockquote> `1.&nbsp; Declaring Appellant as a bonafide tenant on the subject landholding, thus entitled to security of tenure;<br><br>`2.&nbsp; Ordering the Appellee to maintain the Appellant in the peaceful possession of the subject lot; and<br><br>`3.&nbsp; Directing the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of Nagcarlan, Laguna to assist the Plaintiff and Respondent in the execution of an agricultural leasehold contract between the parties.<br><br>`SO ORDERED.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></div><br>In reversing the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), the CA ruled that petitioner was not a tenant, but a mere <i>patao</i> engaged in providing security for the plantation rather than in undertaking agricultural production.&nbsp; The appellate court noted that the various phases of farm work -- gathering, piling, husking and hauling coconuts -- were done by outside labor.&nbsp; Whenever petitioner took a hand in any phase of the work, he was aptly paid for his labor.<br><br>The CA also held that in transferring his residence to another municipality, he had abandoned the landholding.&nbsp; Since he had ceased to provide security for the plantation, he was no longer entitled to any compensation.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Issues</u></b><br></div><br>In his Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> "I<br></div><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred when it reversed the findings of the DARAB Central Office and declared that petitioner Faustino Esquivel is not a <i>de jure</i> tenant but a mere '<i>patao</i>.'<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred when it reversed the findings of the DARAB Central [Office] and declared that petitioner Faustino Esquivel has abandoned the subject landholding."<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>First Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Petitioner Not a </i>de Jure <i>Tenant</i></u></b><br></div><br>At the outset, we stress that whether a person is a tenant is a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Substantial evidence must establish the concurrence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of all the essential requisites of a tenancy relationship as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee.<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject of the relationship is agricultural land.<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is consent between the parties to the relationship.<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production.<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee.<br><br>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></div><br>In this case, there are two sets of factual findings: one, by the CA and the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD) which found that Esquivel was not a tenant; and the other, by the DARAB which ruled that he was.&nbsp; The conflicting factual findings make this case an exception<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to the general rule that only questions of law may be raised before this Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.&nbsp; For this reason, we gave due course to this Petition.<br><br>The documentary exhibits of petitioner consist of (1) his Affidavit;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (2) receipts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> showing the alleged sharing between him and private respondent of net proceeds from harvests; (3) a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> from the barangay captain of Bayate, Liliw, Laguna, that he was a resident thereof; (4) a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> from the Municipal Assessor's Office listing the landholdings over which private respondent was paying real estate taxes; and (5) the Mediator's Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (<i>Katitikan</i>) of the mediation conference between the parties.<br><br>Sadly for petitioner, his evidence fails to establish all the essential requisites for the existence of a tenancy relationship.&nbsp; It is doctrinal that with respect to a parcel of land, the absence of one element does not make an occupant or a cultivator or a planter a<i> de jure </i>tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A careful examination of the evidence shows that only the receipts -- showing Reyes' payments to him of a 20 percent share in net proceeds from the coconut produce -- have any direct and relevant evidentiary value to the alleged tenancy relationship.<br><br>The Certifications are inconclusive as far as the other requisites are concerned. The only thing that the municipal assessor's Certification proves is that private respondent was paying real taxes on the properties listed therein.&nbsp; Realty tax payment or the declaration of property for tax purposes <i>alone</i> is not a conclusive evidence of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In any event, petitioner could have very well established the status of private respondent as the legal possessor of the subject landholding.&nbsp; The meaning of <i>landholder</i> in a tenancy relationship is not limited to the owner, as the term includes a lessee, a usufructuary or a legal possessor of land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The barangay captain's Certification, on the other hand, merely shows that Esquivel was a resident of Barangay Bayate; it does not advance the claim that petitioner was a tenant. Obviously, the barangay captain -- or the mayor whose attestation appears on the document -- was not the proper authority to make such determination.&nbsp; Even certifications issued by administrative agencies and/or officials concerning the presence or the absence of a tenancy relationship are merely preliminary or provisional and are not binding on the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>More significantly, the exhibits presented by petitioner fail to show one essential element<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> in establishing the existence of a tenancy relationship: the personal cultivation of the land by him alone or with the aid of his immediate farm household.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The PARAD observed the dearth of evidence in this respect:<br><blockquote> "It seems quite paradoxical, if not ironic, that Complainant Esquivel should be invoking the rulings of the Highest Tribunal hereinbefore cited in support of his claim for tenancy status when, in application and in effect, the same negate the existence of the relationship as concern[ing] him.&nbsp; Unlike his case, the seekers in the cited cases had performed various acts of cultivation such as the periodical cleaning of the landholding, the fumigation, smudging or smoking of the plantation, the application of fertilizer and watering of the growing plants to enhance [their] productivity.<br><br>"Nothing of that kind obtains in Esquivel's case for while it is true that he had once planted coconut trees and lanzones on the landholding in question, he had been duly and [aptly] paid for his labor.&nbsp; Neither has he tended the growing plants for [Reyes] had availed himself of hired labor the job.&nbsp; And if ever Esquivel did participate in the harvests of coconuts, he did so for a fee.&nbsp; These chores comprise the odd jobs Esquivel indulged in as sideline to his regular employ as a 'patao' for which he was compensated with the cash equivalent of 20% of the net proceeds from the sale of the produce."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>The DARAB's pronouncement that Esquivel worked on the subject lot did not cite specific, concrete or factual evidence.&nbsp; It was at best speculative, as the following excerpt indicates:<br><blockquote> "x x x [Esquivel] has been living in the subject lot since 1968 when he was installed by [Reyes] thereon to take care of the coconuts and lanzones planted therein.&nbsp; <i>It is in effect putting the life of the plants into the hands of [Esquivel]. In the performance of his duties, the latter has to do some cultivation</i> such as smudging or smoking the plantation, weeding, watering, applying fertilizers and cleaning the surroundings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Italics supplied)<br></blockquote>The exhibits of private respondent, on the other hand, adequately controvert the alleged tenancy relationship. The payrolls<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> he has presented show that he hired laborers to harvest, gather, pile, husk and transport the produce. Significantly, Exhibits 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> -- both bearing the signature of Esquivel -- reveal the payments petitioner received for every coconut and lanzones tree he has planted on the subject lot.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Second Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Abandonment of Landholding</i></u></b><br></div><br>Since Esquivel failed to establish that he was a tenant of Reyes, the former's alternative claim for security of tenure<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> or compensation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> has no leg to stand on. It is settled that unless a person has established his status as a <i>de jure</i> tenant, he is not entitled to the security of tenure or the other benefits provided by the Land Reform Program of the government under existing tenancy laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <i><b>DENIED</b></i>, and the assailed Decision and Resolution <i><b>AFFIRMED</b>. </i>Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona</i>, and <i>Carpio-Morales, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Puno, (Chairman), J.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Also spelled as "Esquibel" in some documents in the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (PARAD), Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) and the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, pp. 11-35.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id., pp. 154-159.&nbsp; Penned by Justice Eliezer R. de los Santos and concurred in by Justices Buenaventura J.
