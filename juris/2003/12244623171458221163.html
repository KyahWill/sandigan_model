				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Even if appellant is guilty of two counts of forcible abduction with rape, he cannot be sentenced to death because the crimes happened in 1990, prior to the effectivity of the Death Penalty Law.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the <i>civil liabilities</i> to be awarded should be equal to those prescribed for crimes committed under circumstances that would have justified the imposition of death, had they been committed after the effectivity of RA 7659.

Luna, Carranglan, Nueva Ecija.&nbsp; The group had just attended a `bangsal-bangsal' or a pre-nuptial dance at Barangay Dipaan, Car[r]anglan, Nueva Ecija.<br><br>"The moon [had] just begun to rise, and the road they were traversing was quite dark.&nbsp; Reaching the boundary of Abibeg and Dipaan, the group was accosted by two (2) armed men.&nbsp; Brandishing their guns, the men ordered the group to follow them.&nbsp; The two (2) armed men wore bonnets.&nbsp; However, Vanelyn Flores recognized one of them as appellant Danilo Caraang, having known him for a long time since they were neighbors in the same barangay and because of the peculiar way he walked and stood. Jimmy Pascual likewise recognized the two armed men as appellant Danilo Caraang and Virgilio Canlas.<br><br>"The group was forced to walk through rice paddies till they reached an uninhabited and grassy place near a creek or `parang,' approximately 500 meters away from the place where they were waylaid.<br><br>"Upon reaching the `parang,' the armed men ordered the female members of the group to sit down while the male members were ordered to lie on the ground face down.<br><br>"Vanelyn Flores was the first female removed from the group by appellant.&nbsp; She knew that it was appellant who grabbed her hand and who pulled her to a nearby creek about 50 meters away.&nbsp; There, Vanelyn saw another man waiting.<br><br>"All of a sudden, appellant poked his gun on Vanelyn's temple and ordered her to remove her pants.&nbsp; Vanelyn became terrified and cried.&nbsp; Appellant forced her to lie down on the ground.&nbsp; He repeated his order that she remove her pants. Vanelyn, however, refused.&nbsp; This prompted appellant's companion to grab both of Vanelyn's hands.&nbsp; As Vanelyn was immobilized, appellant succeeded in removing her pants and underwear. Thereafter, appellant removed his pants, mounted Vanelyn and had sexual intercourse with her.&nbsp; Vanelyn felt excruciating pain.<br><br>"By then, the place was well-illuminated by moonlight.&nbsp; The moment appellant removed his bonnet, Vanelyn saw that her rapist was indeed appellant Danilo Caraang. Vanelyn was sexually abused by appellant for more than 15 minutes, after which she was returned to their group.<br><br>"After an hour, Vanelyn was again forcibly brought by appellant to the nearby creek.&nbsp; Vanelyn was made to lie down by appellant who poked his gun at her. Petrified with fear, Vanelyn could not resist as appellant's companion removed her underwear and her pants. Then appellant's companion mounted her and sexually abused her.&nbsp; Vanelyn again cried because of terrible pain.&nbsp; After appellant's companion had satisfied his lust, appellant returned Vanelyn to the group.&nbsp; He approached Lorna Salazar and forced her to go with him.<br><br>"Lorna Salazar was first blindfolded and then brought to a place away from the group.&nbsp; She was turned over to a man who removed the cover from her eyes. Lorna saw [that] the man [was] wearing a bonnet.<br><br>"The man ordered Lorna to remove her pants but she fought back.&nbsp; Thus, he kicked Lorna hard in the abdomen which caused her to lose consciousness. When she regained consciousness, Lorna felt weak and dizzy.&nbsp; She also saw that she was naked.&nbsp; The man who raped her ordered her to put on her pants.&nbsp; Thereafter, she was returned back to the group.<br><br>"Subsequently, two other companions of appellant, who were also armed, took Lorna Salazar away from the group. They also wanted to rape her. However, as the men were starting to remove her clothes, Lorna cried and pleaded for mercy.&nbsp; The two men relented.&nbsp; One of them asked Lorna to give him a kiss mark instead.&nbsp; As he prepared to be kissed, the man removed his bonnet.&nbsp; Lorna was able to identify him as Manny Belagot.&nbsp; Then she was returned to the group.<br><br>"Around 4 o'clock in the morning, the group was released at the place where they were abducted.&nbsp; Before departing, the armed men threatened the group thus `pag nagsumbong kayo, papatayin naming kayo lahat.'<br><br>"Vanelyn Flores and her sister Angeline, together with Lorna Salazar, arrived at their house crying. They narrated to Vanelyn's parents all about the incident.&nbsp; Immediately, Vanelyn was brought by her parents to San Jose City, where she was examined by Dr. Rolando Valencia.&nbsp; Dr. Valencia reported the following findings:<br><blockquote> `First, Erymetamous vulva meaning the vulva was reddish.&nbsp; Vulva is the external part of the female organ.&nbsp; Then, there was slight abrasion on the vaginal fourchette.&nbsp; Meaning, there was an abrasion in the fourchette. If you will spread the vagina of a woman, the portion that you will see is the fourchette and in the lower portion thereof was the abrasion. My third findings is: Hymenal laceration with sharp edges at 3 o'clock and 7 o'clock. Meaning there was laceration in the hymen particularly at 3 o'clock and 7 o'clock position. The hymen is the rigid membrane.&nbsp; x x x [The] vagina admitted two fingers with difficulty and the patient felt pain. Vaginal cervical [smear], meaning the taking of the fluid from the vagina for examination and it proved of the presence of sperm cell (tamod).<br></blockquote>"Meanwhile, on November 16, 1990, Lorna Salazar was medically examined by Dr. Restituto Duran who reported the following findings:<br><blockquote> `Breast-no contusion, no abrasion, well formed and firm, nipple small, areola brownish in color. Abdomen-no contusion, abrasion, hematoma, rest of the body show no sign of contusion, abrasion and hematoma. Vagina-no signs of contusion, abrasion and hematoma. Pubic hair moderate. Hymen-lacerated at 12:00 o'clock, seven o'clock and six o'clock much lacerated. Vagina canal-admits 1 finger with resistance, admits 2 fingers with much resistance. Cervix is somewhat soft and tender upon touching.<br><br>`The laceration suggests that there was a forceful entrance at the vaginal canal by a hard object.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></b><br></div><br>On the other hand, appellant, in his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> summarizes the facts of the case as follows:<br><blockquote> "This is a case of 4 counts of rape with forcible abduction filed against CARAANG and others. CARAANG was convicted based on the testimonies of the complainants whereby they alleged that they were waylaid and raped by a group of men belonging to the CAFGU. CARAANG [denies] the accusations against him. He maintains that he is innocent and that he was not at the place of the incident and that he was sick at that time. This defense was not believed by the trial court [which] x x x dismissed it as a mere alibi.&nbsp; [Hence] this appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b><br></div><br>The RTC was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that appellant and his cohorts had conspired in abducting the victims and eventually raping them.&nbsp; It gave full faith and credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, especially those of the two victims -- Vanelyn Flores and Lorna Salazar.&nbsp; Upholding the positive identification they had made, it rejected appellant's alibi.<br><br>The court <i>a quo</i> found that only one act of abduction had been committed by all the accused.&nbsp; It added that the crafty way in which they made the victims go with them revealed the lewd intention of the abduction.&nbsp; That the former had intended to have carnal knowledge of the latter from the very beginning was further held by the lower court.&nbsp; The rapes were thus complexed with the crime of abduction.&nbsp; However, the RTC held that the subsequent instances of rape committed were separate and distinct counts thereof.&nbsp; As to the fourth criminal Complaint, it found appellant guilty only of acts of lasciviousness, since no carnal knowledge had occurred.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></div><br>In his appeal, appellant assigns the following alleged errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote> "A. The trial court erred in finding that there was positive identification of Caraang as the rapist."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>"B. The trial court erred in not appreciating the existence of other facts and circumstances which are of weight and substance in favor of the accused-appellant which shows that there is reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>"C. The evidence against the accused did not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient for conviction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>"D. The trial court erred in finding that there was conspiracy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Simply put, the issue to be resolved is whether the prosecution was able to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In the main, appellant contests the positive identification made by the victims and the trial court's finding of conspiracy.&nbsp; He also cites questionable circumstances that allegedly create reasonable doubt in his favor.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The appeal of the rape charges is unmeritorious; however, the alleged acts of lasciviousness have not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Main Issue:<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></u></b><br><b><u><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><i>Proof of Guilt Beyond Reasonable Doubt</i></u></b><br></div><br>In support of his appeal, appellant assails the testimonies of the victims, claiming that these do not pass the test of credibility.&nbsp; He avers that several allegations therein -- especially those made by Flores -- create reasonable doubt.&nbsp; He also enumerates several circumstances that allegedly make the prosecution's case insufficient to rebut the constitutional presumption of innocence.<br><br><i>First</i>, he alleges that Flores could not have positively identified him as one of the perpetrators of the crimes, because it was nighttime when the incident occurred.&nbsp; He further argues that she did not directly testify to having seen him; instead, she merely identified him by the way he spoke, stood and moved.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, he points to alleged inconsistencies between her court testimony and her sworn affidavit before the police.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, he cites questionable circumstances that allegedly create reasonable doubt.&nbsp; He specifically points to the fact that Flores, instead of immediately filing a complaint with the police, went first to the CAFGU detachment with her group -- supposedly a sign that she was unsure of the identities of the culprits.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, he faults the prosecution for failing to present any bloodied panty, pants or dress belonging to the victim.&nbsp; Such failure was supposedly fatal for its part, because it did not present any other physical evidence to prove the rape.&nbsp; <i>Finally</i>, he claims that the RTC erred in finding conspiracy, since the prosecution had likewise failed to prove that there was prior agreement among the accused.<br><br>We will address the sub-issues raised by appellant <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br><i><b><u>Positive Identification</u></b></i><br><br>In discrediting the positive identification made by Flores, appellant argues that she could not have seen the faces of the perpetrators, since the incident happened at nighttime.&nbsp; Moreover, he avers that she did not directly testify that she had seen him; rather, she based the identification purely on the way he spoke, stood and moved.<br><br>We disagree.&nbsp; The testimony of Flores was categorical, convincing and unequivocal.&nbsp; It was replete with details that were consistent with the testimonies of all the other prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; Positively pointing to appellant and his co-accused as the culprits, her straightforward testimony proceeded thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Will you please tell the Honorable Court what was that untoward incident that happened to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td> <div align="justify">We were waylaid/intercepted by Danilo Caraang, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">How many were they?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A </td> <td><div align="justify">There were two of them, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Did you recognize the companion of Danilo Caraang?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td> <div align="justify">No, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Now, please look around and tell the Honorable Court if you can identify Danilo Caraang if he is inside the court room?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td> <div align="justify">That one, sir.

simply sign such documents after being read to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Basic is the rule that, taken <i>ex parte, </i>affidavits are considered incomplete and often inaccurate.&nbsp; They are products sometimes of partial suggestions and at other times of want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which witnesses may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for accurate recollection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Affidavits are generally subordinate in importance to open-court declarations, because the former are often executed when the mental faculties of affiants are not in such state as to afford them a fair opportunity to narrate more extensively the incidents that have transpired.<sup

can the events that transpired during the commission of the crime.&nbsp; Obviously, this kind of opportunity is not available to them when their affidavits are taken.<br><br>By its very nature and the manner it is taken, an affidavit can hardly compare with the weight of a testimony given in open court.&nbsp; Likewise, the supposed failure of eyewitnesses to include some material facts in their affidavits does not in any way diminish the veracity of their court testimonies.&nbsp; In other words, whenever there is inconsistency between the two, the latter commands greater weight.<sup

There can be no violation of the constitutional right of appellant against double jeopardy, because the decisive issue here is whether he was convicted of a crime charged in the Information.&nbsp; A reading of the four separate Informations shows that in each one, he was indeed charged with forcible abduction with rape.&nbsp; Having been sufficiently informed of the accusations against him, he can thus be convicted of two counts of the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape, as we have done here based on the evidence presented.<br><br>Moreover, it is settled that when the accused appeals from the sentence of the trial court, they waive their right to the constitutional safeguard against double jeopardy and throw the whole case open to review by the appellate court.&nbsp;

The crime of forcible abduction was necessary only for the first rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> After the complex crime had already been consummated, the subsequent rape can no longer be considered as a separate instance thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> That is, it should be detached from, and considered independently of, the forcible abduction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Hence, any subsequent rape of the same victim is simply rape and can no longer be considered as a separate complex crime of forcible abduction with rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code governs complex crimes as follows: <br><blockquote> "Art. 48. <i>Penalty for complex crimes</i>. - When a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, or when an offense is a necessary means for committing the other, the penalty for the most serious crime shall be imposed, the same to be applied in its maximum period."</blockquote><b><u><i>Penalty for the More<br></i><i>Serious Crime</i></u></b><br><br>As earlier adverted to, the forcible abduction was necessary for the succeeding rape of each victim.&nbsp; Consequently, for the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape, the penalty for the rape -- which is the more serious crime -- shall be imposed in its maximum period.&nbsp; At the time of the commission of the crime, the applicable penalty for rape committed by two or more persons was <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; Since the rape was committed by two or more persons&nbsp; --&nbsp; a fact duly alleged in the Information and proven in court -- it should have warranted the imposition of the death penalty.<br><br>However, appellant committed the crime of forcible abduction with rape on November 10, 1990 -- before the passage of Republic Act 7659 or the Death Penalty Law, which took effect on December 31, 1993.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that the penalty that could be imposed was <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>As regards the act of rape committed against Flores, appellant is likewise sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; This separate act of rape, directly and successively committed against her by his co-accused, was the only one remaining for which he may be further held liable.&nbsp; All told, three terms of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>should be imposed upon him.<br><br><u><b><i>Damages</i></b></u><br><br>Regarding appellant's pecuniary liabilities, we award P75,000 as civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> for each of the two (2) counts of the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape instead of the P50,000 compensatory damages awarded by the trial court.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, considering that the rape was committed by two or more persons, as alleged in the Information and proven in court, an increase in civil indemnity is proper.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, this Court has previously ordered the accused to pay civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000, so long as the crime was committed under circumstances that would justify the imposition of the death penalty -- even if that penalty had not yet been imposed -- because the crime was committed before the effectivity of the Death Penalty Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Likewise, we affirm the award of P50,000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> as moral damages for each of the two counts of forcible abduction with rape.&nbsp; Moral damages are given without need of further proof other than the fact of rape.&nbsp; The law recognizes the victim's injury, which is concomitant with and necessarily results from the odiousness of the crime, thus warranting per se the award of moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>As to exemplary damages, Article 2230 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote> "ART.&nbsp; 2230.&nbsp; In criminal offenses, exemplary damages as a part of the civil liability may be imposed when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.
