In August 1999, he brought the victim to the house of Alex Guaron in VMU for about seven times.<br><br>On August 16, 1999, at about 12:00 noon, he fetched the victim at San Carlos College and as they were on board a tricycle on their way to VMU, they passed by Joan who later joined them.&nbsp; On arrival at Alex's house, they then proceeded to VMU where they had a drinking session together with Alex and two others.<br><br>He purposely brought the victim and Joan to the hut because he wanted to severe his relationship with the two, his wife having discovered his extra-marital&nbsp;&nbsp; affairs with them.&nbsp; The victim and Joan proffered no objection to his proposal.&nbsp; After a brief drinking session, he, together with the victim and Joan went to the plaza where they ate in an eatery before they finally bade each other goodbye.<br><br>Alex corroborated appellant's version.<br><br>In fine, appellant denies that rape ever took place on August 16, 1999.<br><br>Rejecting the sweetheart theory of appellant, the trial court <b><i>convicted</i></b> him as charged by the decision on appeal the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE,</b> in the light of all the foregoing, the Court hereby finds the accused Crispin Payopay guilty beyond reasonable doubt, with the crime of Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. The court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and indemnify Maricel de Guzman the sum of P50,000.00 and to pay her exemplary damages of P25,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br></blockquote>In his brief, appellant assigns to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> I<br></div><br>. . . IN GIVING DUE WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WHICH IS PUNCTURED WITH MATERIAL INCONSISTENCY, UNCERTAINTY AND UNRELIABILITY THEREBY CASTING GRAVE DOUBT ON THE CRIMINAL CULPABILITY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT; [AND]<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>. . . IN FINDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT USED FORCE AGAINST PRIVATE COMPLAINANT IN THE PERPETRATION OF THE INCIDENT IN QUESTION.<br></blockquote>From the decision of the trial court, it is gathered that in convicting appellant, it relied chiefly on the testimony of the victim. Thus the trial court held:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> x x x<br></div><br>In her testimony, Maricel recounted how she resisted Crispin. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resistance indicates use of force</span>. In this case, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">credibility of her story was further&nbsp; bolstered&nbsp; by her actuations subsequent to the commission of the crime</span> when she brought Joan with her and they proceeded to the police station where she executed a sworn statement and underwent a medical examination.<br><br>The sweetheart theory is a defense that is becoming common in rape cases. This is a defense which negates force or intimidation, an essential element in the crime of rape. Even if Crispin's averment that they are sweetheart is true, it does not necessarily follow that no rape has been committed against one's sweetheart. A sweetheart cannot be forced to engage in sexual intercourse against her will.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>In a long line of rape cases, this Court upheld the rule that:<br><blockquote> An accused may be convicted [of rape] on the basis of the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim, <b><i>provided that her testimony is clear, positive, convincing and otherwise consistent with human nature</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>The place where the victim was allegedly taken by force by appellant - in the premises of the San Carlos College - is located in a public place which was admittedly teeming with students. The time was 12:00 o'clock noon of a regular school day.&nbsp; It is highly unthinkable that appellant would drag the victim in the presence of so many students and no one would heed her shouts for help.&nbsp; That runs counter to human experience as it mocks at human sensibility.&nbsp; Just as it is unthinkable how the victim would be overcome by fear to thereby prevent her from forcefully resisting or struggling even when what appellant merely initially did to her was, by her own account, forcibly grab her by her hands as she stepped out of school.<br><br>And given the victim's claim that appellant had priorly raped her on August 4, 1999 and on two other occasions, it is incomprehensible why she, on August 16, 1999, did not flee or cry out in protest or in anger when they reached and passed through the guarded barrier or boom-equipped gate to the VMU.<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td
