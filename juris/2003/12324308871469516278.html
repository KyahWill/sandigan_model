Belonghilot (Dario), Rino M. Castillo (Rino) and Rolando T. Barcelonia (Rolando), of the crime of rape with homicide. The victim was AAA (AAA), a thirty-year-old wife and mother of four.<br><br>Dario had previously appealed his conviction to us through a petition for review, docketed as G.R. No. 128512. Considering that the death penalty was imposed, the case was also forwarded to us on automatic review and docketed as G.R. No. 128963.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In a resolution dated August 12, 1997, we ordered the two cases consolidated.<br><br><b><u><center><u>The Antecedents</u></center></u></b><br>On February 11, 1994, at about 1:00 a.m., AAA and her husband <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely Pasco</span> (<span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span>), were among forty-seven or so <i>buseros</i> (members of a fishing outfit), who were pulling a beach seine (a large vertical fishing net) near the seashore in Lower Dipane, Manukan, Zamboanga del Norte. When <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> saw that the beach seine had a large haul, he instructed AAA to go to their house and get another container. AAA left and that was the last time he saw her alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>At about 3:00 a.m., when AAA did not come back, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> went to their house to look for her. Finding that AAA was not there, he returned to the beach seine to ask for help from the <i>buseros</i> to look for his wife. A search for AAA ensued. At around 4:00 a.m., the body of AAA was found, naked and lifeless, covered only with dry coconut leaves, some 250 meters away from the location of the beach seine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The local police of Manukan, Zamboanga del Norte, commenced an investigation. Eventually, they arrested 16-year-old Rolando for the crime, and decided to use 20-year-old Dario and 16-year-old Rino as government witnesses. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span>, not satisfied with the outcome of the police investigation, sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Acting on <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely’s</span> request, the NBI assigned the case to Agent Atty. Oscar D. Tamorong. After conducting its own investigation, the NBI filed charges against Dario, Rino and Rolando with the Provincial Prosecutor for Zamboanga del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On the basis of the NBI report, the following information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was filed:<br><br>The undersigned, Provincial Prosecutor, accuses DARIO P.

Sevillista, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely Pasco</span>, NBI Agent Atty. Oscar D. Tamarong and <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yolanda Mecoliar</span>. Their testimonies are summarized as follows:<br><br><b>Dr. Reneir V. Alonzo</b> was the Rural Health Physician who conducted the post mortem examination on the body of AAA on February 11, 1994. He testified that he found, as indicated in the examination report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> a periorbital contusion/hematoma on the victim’s right eye, a linear abrasion on her right upper eyebrow, a whitish foam on the mouth and nostrils, contusions around the neck, a linear abrasion on the abdomen and contusion on both buttocks. Dr. Alonzo further stated that when he examined the victim’s private part, he found a whitish mucus substance. A vaginal smear was taken which tested positive for sperm cells. He identified the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to asphyxia (submersion in water).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b>Rolando M. Sevillista</b> was the operator of the fishing outfit that pulled the beach seine on the day that AAA was found dead. Mr. Sevillista testified that among those who were present near the seashore were: AAA, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span>, and appellants, Dario, Rino and Rolando. He added that he noticed that appellants were drunk that night of February 10, 1994. Mr. Sevillista narrated that, at about 3:00 a.m. of February 11, 1994, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> told him that his wife did not return and asked permission to look for her. Later, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> came back and told him that he was not able to find his wife. As a result, the whole fishing group assisted in the search. Eventually, the naked body of AAA was discovered, covered only with coconut leaves and with bruises on her neck and face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Mr. Sevillista further testified that he observed three sets of footprints around the area where the body was found. The first two sets appeared side by side, while the third set was isolated and appeared to have come from the seashore, going towards the body. Mr. Sevillista also stated that, earlier in the evening, he saw appellants Dario and Rino among the <i>buseros</i> wearing dry clothing. But later on, when he noticed them a second time, they were suddenly wet “near the thigh.” He inquired how they became wet and the two explained that they had to cross the Dipane river. However, he found their story not believable because he knew that it was already low tide so that the river could easily be crossed just by jumping over it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><b><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely Pasco</span></b>, the prosecution’s third witness, testified that both he and his wife were with the fishing outfit in the early morning of February 11, 1994. At around 1:00 a.m., when <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> observed that they had plenty of catch, he instructed AAA to go home to get another container. When AAA left, he noticed that Dario and Rino followed her. An hour later, at around 2:00 a.m., he saw that the two appellants were back with the fishing outfit. However, he observed that Rino was now wet up to his waist while someone informed him that Dario was likewise wet the same way. At around 3:00 a.m., when AAA failed to come back, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> went to their house to look for her. Seeing that she was not in their house, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> returned to the beach seine to ask for help in looking for his wife. After a coordinated effort to look for his wife, the body of AAA was found in a coconut plantation near the shore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The barangay captain informed the police authorities of Manukan, Zamboanga del Norte about the incident. Thereafter, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> learned that the police had arrested Rolando and intended to make Dario and Rino as government witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The police told him that they will just file a case against one and the other two will be used as witnesses so that the case will can solved easily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> did not like the outcome of the investigation because he believed that Dario and Rino were the real perpetrators of the crime, since they were the ones whom he saw follow his wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Because of this development, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> sought assistance from the NBI to conduct its own investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>Oscar D. Tomarong</b> was the agent who conducted the NBI investigation. Agent Tomarong testified that in the early morning of February 11, 1994, he received a call from a certain Mr. Teodoro Urquiaga, informing him about the death of AAA. The following day Agent Tomarong went to the crime scene to investigate. He observed that there were footprints originating from the seawater and ending where the body was found. There were also footprints coming from the body and going towards the direction of the Dipane river. He added that the impressions of the footprints coming from the seawater were bigger than those going to the river and that the latter were more in number such that it is possible that these were made by two people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Agent Tomarong further stated that after his initial investigation, he learned that the police authorities of Manukan had picked up Dario and Rino for questioning. This caused him to terminate his investigation in order to give the police authorities a chance to finish their investigation. Eventually, the police concluded their investigation with the filing of charges against Rolando. It was set for preliminary investigation with the municipal trial court of Manukan. Thereafter, Agent Tomarong heard that <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> was complaining that justice was not served by the police investigation because his suspects were not charged and, instead, were made government witnesses. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> then pleaded with the NBI to take over the investigation. On February 18, 1994, the NBI requested the municipal trial court to defer its preliminary investigation of Rolando so that the NBI could conduct a further investigation of the matter. The municipal trial court granted the request and the police turned over to Agent Tomarong the custody of Rolando, and the two witnesses, Dario and Rino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Agent Tomarong narrated that, on their way to the NBI office, Rolando told him that he was not alone in committing the crime. To see if Rolando was telling the truth, he stopped at the crime scene and had Rolando demonstrate how the crime was committed. Later that day, Rolando confessed in writing and in the presence of his counsel, Atty. Romero, to his participation in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On February 22, 1994, Rino executed his own written confession, in the presence of his counsel Atty. Carpio, regarding his participation in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The following day, Rolando and Rino reenacted on video how the crime was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yolanda Mecoliar</span></b> was among the <i>buseros</i> present who were gathering fish the day AAA died. Ms. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mecoliar</span> testified that she remembered seeing appellants Dario, Rino and Rolando there. She also testified that she saw Dario and Rino follow AAA when she left and that Dario and Rino returned at around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m. of February 11, 1994, already wet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Ms. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mecoliar</span> further testified that Rolando and Rino admitted in her presence their participation in the death of AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Also part of the prosecution’s evidence are the extrajudicial confessions of Rolando and Rino.<br><br>In his extrajudicial confession,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Rolando narrated that on the evening of February 10, 1994, at about 8:30 p.m., after watching a video show in Villaramos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> he, Rino and Dario drank tuba in the store of Martina Cabrera. After consuming one gallon of tuba, they went to Dario’s house. There, they drank more tuba and smoked marijuana. At about 11:00 p.m., they left the house and went with a group of <i>buseros</i> who were going to the beach seine near the Dipane river ,along the seashore. Among those in the group was AAA. Along the way, Dario suggested to Rino and Rolando that they have sexual intercourse with AAA because, according to Dario “AAA is fond of fucking.” Rino and Rolando agreed because they considered Dario as their leader.<br><br>While on the seashore, Rolando noticed that AAA left the group and walked towards her house. Upon seeing Dario and Rino follow AAA, he followed them at a distance of about 3 fathoms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He then narrated that when Dario and Rino were at the side of AAA, they started to rape her. Dario held the hair of AAA, while Rino held her waist. AAA struggled to free herself but she was thrown to the ground. Then Dario pressed the head of AAA to the water. Not long thereafter, AAA stopped moving. Later on, Dario and Rino, who were laughing, said to him “It’s you turn” while making a fucking sign with their fingers. After that, Dario and Rino left to return to the beach seine. Rolando, left alone, carried AAA’s body to a dry place. He observed that her neck was broken but her hands moved. He then got aroused when he saw the naked body of AAA and he inserted his penis into AAA’s vagina until he had an orgasm. When he was finished, he covered AAA’s body with coconut leaves and went home. When asked why he did not help AAA, Rolando replied that he did not think of helping her because he had agreed to their plan earlier.<br><br>Rino, in his extrajudicial confession,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> confirmed that on the night of February 10, 1994, he, Rolando and Dario watched a video show and then proceeded to the house of Martina Cabrera to drink tuba. They continued drinking in Dario’s house and also smoked marijuana. Thereafter, they proceeded to the beach seine to get some fish.<br><br>While waiting for the fish to be hauled, they saw AAA walk away from the group. They followed her. After walking about 200 meters from the Dipane river, AAA turned her head towards them. As she turned, Dario boxed her on the head, causing her to fall. AAA staggered to get up and tried to shout for help. But Dario held and twisted her head, while Rino held her waist. During the struggle, Rino heard a cracking sound. Thereafter, Dario pushed AAA’s head into the water until her body, except for her hands, stopped moving. Her hands continued to tremble. Dario then lifted her and Rino stepped back. From his vantage point, he saw Dario squat near the body of AAA for about half an hour. After that, Dario went to Rino and they gave each other “high fives.” Rolando came along and Dario told him that it was his turn. At that moment a beam of light was flashed in their direction, prompting Rino to leave Dario and Rolando and return to the beach seine. Not long thereafter, Dario arrived at the beach seine. They then asked for fish and went to Dario’s house to sleep. Rino left the next morning to go home.<br><br>Rino and Dario saw each other that afternoon. It was then that Dario suggested that they implicate Rolando as the one who killed and raped AAA. They agreed to fabricate a story that would make it appear that on the night of the incident, Rino saw Rolando following AAA; that he then followed Rolando; and that when he saw that Rolando was abusing AAA, he ran away. Dario and Rino narrated this story to a barangay councilman. The following morning, they were taken by the police and made to sign affidavits.<br><br><b><center><u><u>The Defense’s Evidence</u></u></center></b><br>Appellants all testified in their defense. Dario’s younger sister, Neslie Belonghilot, and Evelyn Ogarte, were also presented as their fourth and fifth witnesses. Their testimonies are substantially as follows:<br><br><b>Rolando Barcelonia</b> testified to repudiate his written confession and deny having any involvement in the death of AAA. Rolando claimed that his extrajudicial confession was obtained through coercion and was written without the assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He added that his lawyer, Atty. Romero of the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO), arrived after his confession had already been prepared and signed by him. He informed Atty. Romero about this but that the reaction of the latter was to countersign the confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Rolando narrated that on the night of February 10, 1994, he was with Dario and Rino watching a video in Villaramos. After watching the video, all three went to Martin Cabrera’s house and drank one ball of <i>tuba</i>. Thereafter, they went to the house of Dario and just chatted. After a while, they proceeded to the beach seine to ask for some fish. When they were able to get some fish, they returned to Dario’s house to sleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><b>Rino Castillo</b> likewise repudiated his extrajudicial confession. He claimed that Agent Tomarong mauled him while he was detained in the NBI office.

When they finished drinking, they went to the beach seine to ask for fish. After getting some fish, they went back to Dario’s house and slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>Dario Belonghilot</b> also denied any involvement in the death of AAA.

Thereafter, the three, accompanied by Dario’s younger sister Neslie, proceeded to the beach seine where they were able to get a pail of fish. They then brought the fish to his house where it was eaten, before they slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><b>Neslie Belonghilot</b>, the 12-year-old sister of Dario, testified that she was with her brother and his friends when went they went to the beach seine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She claimed that they were together the whole time until they went back to Dario’s house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>Evelyn Ogarte</b> testified that she saw appellants near the beach seine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> She claimed that at no time did appellants leave the beach seine from the time they first arrived until they left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>After all the evidence had been presented, the trial court rendered a decision finding that appellants, acting in conspiracy with each other, were guilty of rape with homicide, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, as actual participants, acting in conspiracy with each other, aggravated by nighttime, aforestated three accused are hereby pronounced with moral certainty GUILTY as charged.

The confession is admissible until the accused successfully proves that it was given as a result of violence, intimidation, threat, or promise of reward or leniency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the admissibility of the confessions were established by the prosecution through the testimony of Agent Tomarong, who confirmed that the declarants Rino and Rolando were appraised of their constitutional rights and that their extrajudicial confessions were taken with the presence of their respective counsel. Each of the extrajudicial confession bears the signature of counsel, showing that it was executed in his presence and with his assistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Hence, it became incumbent upon appellants to overturn, through convincing evidence, the presumption of validity of the confessions.<br><br>Appellants, to support their claim, merely presented the bare allegations of Rino and Rolando. No other proof was presented that force and violence were employed to coerce them to sign their extrajudicial confessions or that such confessions were taken without the presence of their respective counsel. In fact, Rolando admitted on cross-examination that his claim that his counsel was not present during the investigation and that his confession was false and coerced were only brought out for the first time in his testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Plainly, appellants have failed to show convincing evidence that would bar the confessions from being admitted into evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> As we cannot declare the extrajudicial confessions invalid on the bare allegations of appellants, the confessions must be allowed to stand.<br><br>It bears noting that Atty. Romero was Rolando’s counsel during the taking of his extrajudicial confession and continued on as his counsel during the presentation of the evidence-in-chief by the prosecution. He later withdrew his representation, because his client decided to “change his theory of defense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This strongly indicates that appellants’ claims that they were forced to execute their extrajudicial confessions, without the assistance of counsel, were mere afterthoughts.<br><br>The claims of Rino and Rolando are also belied by the fact that they took part in reenacting the crime, which was video taped and shown in court. The trial court, in viewing the video tape, was in a best position to observe the manner and behavior of the participants and it found nothing that would indicate that the reenactment was involuntary. Furthermore, in <i>People v. Tia Fong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> we held that if the appellant had not really taken part in the commission of the crime, his immediate reaction should have been to protest or refuse to participate.<br><br>Appellants further assert that the letters of request, showing that Rolando and Rino had asked to be represented by counsel from the PAO, are dubious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It is argued that Rolando and Rino were incapable of writing the letters themselves since they are ignorant as to who to write to and that they have no means to write from their cells. In their respective testimonies, Rino and Rolando claimed that they were just made to copy from a draft letter of request without knowing the contents thereof. On this basis, according to appellants, it can be surmised that no counsel was present during the taking of the confessions.<br><br>This argument has no merit. The possibility that Rolando and Rino merely copied the letters of request without understanding what it was for or knowing who was the lawyer they were requesting, does not prove that they executed their confessions without the assistance of counsel. To put it plainly, appellants’ argument is pure speculation.<br><br>Moreover, even if Rolando and Rino did not choose their counsel, that fact alone does not vitiate their confessions. There is no requirement that their lawyers should be previously known to them. A lawyer provided by the investigators is deemed engaged by the accused where he never raised any objection against the former’s appointment during the course of the investigation and the accused subscribes to the veracity of his statement before the swearing officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Appellants also argue that, even assuming the extrajudicial confessions are admissible against the declarants Rolando and Rino, they are considered hearsay and inadmissible as direct evidence against Dario,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> who did not execute a confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>There is no dispute as to the fact that Dario did not execute an extrajudicial confession. While the extrajudicial confessions of Rolando and Rino implicated him as the person who held AAA’s head in the water, the prosecution did not present any witness to say that he actually saw him kill AAA. Be that as it may, a confession may still be admitted against the co-accused as corroborative or circumstantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><b><center><u><i>Second Issue</i>: Sufficiency of the Evidence</u></center></b><br>In the present case, aside from the extrajudicial confessions, the following circumstantial evidence has been established:<br><ol type="1"><li> Dario, Rino and Rolando knew each other and were together beginning the evening of February 10, 1994 until the early morning of February 11, 1994.<br><br></li><li> On February 11, 1994, at about 1:00 a.m., Dario, Rino and Rolando, were at the beach seine together with AAA, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> and the other <i>buseros</i>.<br><br></li><li> When AAA left the beach seine, Dario and Rino followed her.<br><br></li><li> After an hour, Dario and Rino returned to the beach seine with wet clothes.<br><br></li><li> There were footprints around the body of AAA, with one set creating deep impressions on the sand and two other sets going to the Dipane river.<br><br></li><li> The post-mortem examination revealed that AAA died of “cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to asphyxia (submersion in water)” and the vaginal smear proved positive for sperm cells.<br><br></li><li> AAA suffered hematoma on her right eye and contusions around her neck.<br><br></li><li> The Certificate of Death<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> showed that AAA died at around 2:00 a.m. of February 11, 1994.<br></li></ol>To justify a conviction upon circumstantial evidence, the combination of circumstances must be such as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind as to the criminal liability of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> After evaluating the evidence presented, we find that the extrajudicial confessions have been fully corroborated by the above circumstances which form an unbroken chain leading to the fair and reasonable conclusion that appellants are guilty of the crime of rape with homicide.<br><br>The extrajudicial confessions of Rino and Rolando corroborate the testimony of other witnesses that Dario and Rino followed AAA when she left the beach seine, and that Dario and Rino returned to the beach seine already wet.<br><br>The confessions also explained the other evidence that were found on the scene. Rolando’s confession that he carried the body of AAA to the coconut trees explained the deep impression caused by footprints found on the seashore, leading to the body of AAA. Rino’s confession that he and Dario crossed the Dipane river explained the two sets of footprints found near the river. The confession that AAA was submerged in water until she did not move explains the medical finding that AAA died because of cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to asphyxia (submersion in water). The narration that Dario boxed AAA on her eye and twisted her neck explained the hematoma on her right eye and contusions around her neck. Rolando’s confession that he carried AAA’s body to the coconut trees explains the location where the body was found. Finally, AAA’s time of death stated in the Certificate of Death, 2:00 a.m., is about the same time Dario and Rino returned to the beach seine.<br><br>All things considered, the totality of the evidence presented passes the test of moral certainty and establishes beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of appellants.<br><br>Appellant Dario, however, contends that the prosecution failed to prove that he was wet up to his waist when he returned to the beach seine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> He argues that the testimony of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span>, that he saw Dario wet, cannot be given credence because, on cross-examination, he admitted that it was somebody else who saw him wet. He also argues that the footprints found on the shore, alleged to be of appellants, are unreliable since they could have been made by anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>We do not generally disturb the findings of fact of the trial court, which are entitled to great weight and respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In our analysis of the records of the case, we found nothing that would require us to depart from this well-established rule.<br><br>It may be true that <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ely</span> did not actually see Dario wet, but there were other witnesses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> who testified that they personally saw Dario wet, thereby supporting the finding of the trial court. As for the assessment on the footprints, it is possible that they could have been made by anyone. Yet, even assuming that the footprints were not of appellants, such a finding alone would be insufficient to overturn their conviction, in the face of the other evidence presented by the prosecution.<br><br>Appellants also argue that Agent Tomarong’s testimony should not be given credence because of his obvious motive to see to it that a conviction is produced at any expense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Again, we state the well-entrenched rule that the findings of the trial court on the issue of credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect and accorded the highest consideration by the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The zeal of the agent investigating the case, pointed out by appellants, cannot be taken to mean that evidence was fabricated to support a conviction. Indeed, most of appellants’ arguments attacking the credibility of Agent Tomarong are simply surmises and conjectures, and fail to prove that the witness was ill motivated to testify falsely against them.<br><br>Dario next faults the trial court for not giving credence to his alibi that he was just near the beach seine the whole time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> To corroborate his claim, Dario presented his twelve-year-old sister, Neslie, who testified that she was with Dario, Rino and Rolando from the time they went to the beach seine until the time they returned home.<br><br>The trial court found Dario’s alibi to be suspect. Neslie claimed that she was with Dario, Rino and Rolando. However, when Rino and Rolando were on the witness stand, they declared that it was only the two of them and Dario who went to the beach seine. Never did they mention the presence of Neslie.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Denial is inherently a weak defense. To be believed, it must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability. Otherwise, such denial is purely self-serving and without merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>We agree with the trial court, whose evaluation of the testimonial evidence is accorded great respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The testimonies of Dario and his sister do not establish by clear and convincing evidence the alibi of Dario against the positive testimonies of witnesses who saw Dario and Rino follow AAA. The failure of Rino and Rolando to state in their earlier testimony that Neslie was with them, strongly puts into question her claim that she was actually present near the beach seine. Moreover, Dario’s alibi is further demolished by the fact that it was corroborated by a relative whose motive is suspect. An alibi, to be believed, must receive credible corroboration from disinterested witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Conversely, an alibi becomes less plausible when it is corroborated by relatives and friends who may not be impartial witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Dario finally contends that the prosecution failed to prove that he had any motive for committing the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Suffice it to say that the lack of motive for committing the crime does not preclude conviction for such crime when the crime and participation of the accused are definitely proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>However, we find that the trial court erred in finding that the crime committed was aggravated by nighttime. The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which took effect on December 1, 2000, requires that every complaint or information should specify the offense’s qualifying and aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> This rule may be given retroactive effect in the light of the settled doctrine that statutes regulating the procedure of the court will be construed as applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Considering that the information in this case did not specify any qualifying or aggravating circumstances, the aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot be appreciated.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7659, otherwise known as the new Death Penalty Law, took affect on December 31, 1993 and classifies the Rape with homicide as a heinous crime punishable by death. Considering the crime charged occurred on February 11, 1994, it was only proper for the trial court to impose the supreme penalty upon Dario. Rino and Rolando would have been meted out similar penalties were it not for the fact that they were minors when they perpetrated the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Consequently, the penalty next lower in degree, reclusion perpetua, was properly imposed upon them.<br><br>Three of our Members maintain the unconstitutionality of Republic Act No. 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty. Nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed herein.<br><br>As for the civil liability of appellants, we find it necessary to modify the amounts awarded by the trial court.<br><br>We reiterate our ruling in <i>People v. Tablon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> that judicial policy has authorized the mandatory award of P50,000 in case of death, and P50,000 upon the finding of the fact of rape. In the same case, we further declared that P50,000 may be awarded as moral damages without the need for pleading or proof of the basis thereof other than the fact of rape. Consequently, we maintain the award of P50,000 as death compensation but additionally award P50,000 for the rape. The award of moral damages is reduced to P50,000. An award of P25,000 as exemplary damages should also be added.<br><br>Evidence on record reveals that the heirs of AAA are entitled to more than the P200,000 awarded for loss of earning capacity. AAA was 30 years old at the time of her death. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Eli</span> testified that AAA was earning approximately P1,500 a month, or P18,000 annually, and would have lived to about 80 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Applying the formula in <i>People v.
