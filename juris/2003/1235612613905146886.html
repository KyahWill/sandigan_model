The Constitution in fact mandates that lower courts should resolve cases within 3 months, clearly intended to prevent delay in the administration of justice which erodes the faith and confidence of our people in the judiciary, lowers its standards, and brings it into disrepute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Respondent did not indicate in his undated Manifestation of Compliance <b>when </b>he decided a total of 115 cases. Unquestionably though, they were decided beyond the reglementary period. Why he did not comply with the reglementary period of 90 days to render a decision, he did not also explain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>When judges are unable to render a decision within the required period, they are not without remedy. It is not uncommon for this Court, upon proper application and in meritorious cases, especially when difficult questions of law or complex issues are involved, to grant judges of lower courts additional time to decide beyond the 90-day period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In respondent's case however, he never requested for additional time to decide the cases submitted for decision. As correctly observed by the OCA, the only instance that he attempted to seek approval for additional time was when he submitted certificates of service <b>after</b> the conduct of the audit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>This Court notes that as found by the OCA and reflected in the record on hand, the following reasons aggravated the delay of respondent in the disposition of cases:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Sessions are held only three days a week;<br><br></li><li> Administrative Circular No. 7-A-92 dated June 21, 1993 was not faithfully complied with;<br><br></li><li> Cases cognizable by the court still go through the preliminary investigation process; and<br><br></li><li> Failure to properly observe the following circulars:</li></ol><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">a)</td><td width="90%">Administrative Circular No. 1 dated January 28, 1998, reiterated in Administrative Circular 10-94 dated June 29, 1994 regarding effective docket control; and</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">b)</td><td><div align="justify">Circular No. 13 dated July 1, 1987, reiterated in Administrative Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999 regarding the guidelines to insure the speedy disposition of cases.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>Respondent's delayed disposition of a big number of cases reflects the cramming done by him in rendering of decisions, which should not be the manner in which judges should render decisions. For decision-making entails a thorough study of the evidence presented and the applicable laws for each case.<br><br>The administrative complaint against respondent arose in 2000. Hence, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, before it was amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC, which took effect on October 1, 2001, applies, for the amendment cannot apply retroactively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Section 10 of said Rule 140 provides for the following:<br><br>Section 10. <i>Sanctions</i>.<br><br><center>x x x</center><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">B.</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">If the respondent is found culpable of having committed a less serious charge, any of the following sanctions shall be imposed:</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><ol type="1"><li> Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for one (1) to two (2) months and twenty-nine days; or<br><br></li><li> A fine not less than P10,000 but not more than P19,999.</li></ol></blockquote><center>x x x</center><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>Judge Lauro G.
