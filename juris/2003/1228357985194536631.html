				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 46, Urdaneta City, in Criminal Case No. U-10446 finding herein appellant Romeo Eclera, Sr. guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of qualified rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death.<br><br>The accusatory portion of the information filed by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Emma Ines-Pajaras read as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about September 22, 1999, in the afternoon, at Brgy. San Vicente West, Asingan, Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with his own daughter, herein complainant Riolyn Eclera, a minor, 17 years old, against her will, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY to Art. <i>335, </i>Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act Nos. <i>7659 </i>and 8353.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Upon arraignment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on January 10, 2000, appellant Romeo Eclera, Sr., assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented three witnesses: Dr. Gloria Araos-Liberato, the medico-legal officer who examined the complainant; Rosalinda Eclera, mother of the complainant and wife of appellant; and complainant Riolyn Eclera. On the other hand, five witnesses testified for the defense: Florida Monce and Salome Tiong, professors of complainant Riolyn at the Pangasinan State University (PSU); Teresita Mamalio, a social worker of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Asingan Branch; SPO3 Fausto Marzan, PNP Asingan; and appellant Romeo Eclera, Sr.<br><br>As testified to by prosecution witnesses, the facts of the case are as follows:<br><br>Complainant Riolyn is the sixth child of appellant Romeo Eclera, Sr. and Rosalinda Eclera, who were married sometime in 1974. At the time of the rape, Riolyn was a 17-year-old, first year college student at the PSU in Asingan, Pangasinan.<br><br>On September 22, 1999, at around 4:00 p.m., Riolyn arrived home from school and went straight to her room to change her clothes. As she was dressing up, her father, herein appellant, entered her room. He approached her from behind, touched her breasts and kissed her lips. Then, he forced her to lie down on the floor and mounted her. Appellant pinned both hands of the victim with one hand while his other hand raised her shirt and removed her shorts and underwear. Appellant then pulled down his pants and underwear to his knees and caressed his penis before partially penetrating Riolyn. She felt pain in her vagina. Appellant made a push and pull movement for about two minutes. Then, Riolyn felt a hot substance come out of his penis into her vagina. At this point, she kicked appellant, causing him to loosen his hold on her. Riolyn hurriedly put on her clothes, ran to the rice field where her mother Rosalinda was working and reported the incident to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>When confronted by his wife Rosalinda about the incident, appellant denied having raped Riolyn. He even beat up Rosalinda and threatened to kill her and Riolyn if they ever report the matter to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The following day, September 23, 1999, Rosalinda went to the DSWD, Asingan Branch, and reported the incident to Teresa Mamalio, a social worker. However, Mamalio advised Rosalinda to go to DSWD, Urayong, Bauang, La Union Branch, as she was also scared of appellant, who was at that time a barangay captain of San Vicente West, Asingan, Pangasinan.<br><br>Thus, Rosalinda brought Riolyn and her four daughters to the DSWD in La Union. They reported the matter to Maricel Seria, also a social worker, but it was only a month later or on October 25, 1999, when Riolyn executed a complaint-affidavit against appellant. Upon the execution of her complaint-affidavit, Riolyn was examined at the Asingan Community Hospital by Dr. Gloria Araos-Liberato whose findings were as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">A.</td><td width="90%"><u>External Findings: </u></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>No evident signs of extragenital physical injuries noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination. </td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td>B.</td><td><u>Internal Findings: </u></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Healed incomplete hymenal laceration at 9:00, 3:00 and 7:30 o'clock position. </td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>For his defense, appellant interposed denial. He testified that, on the day of the alleged rape incident, he was at the house of Vice Mayor Piso who invited him and a certain Barangay Captain Cloma to dine and drink. He stayed at the Vice Mayor's house in Asingan until past 4:00 p.m. Thereafter, he passed by the house of an Iglesia ni Cristo minister because a deacon requested him to come in connection with a complaint filed by his wife Rosalinda. When he arrived home at past 5:00 p.m., his wife Rosalinda and children Gemini, April Joy, Mahalia, Angelica, Riolyn and Romeo, Jr. were all inside the house watching television.<br><br>To corroborate his testimony, appellant presented a neighbor, Josefina Gromio, who testified that her house was only about two arms' length away from the Eclera house. The whole day of the incident, she was at home, tending to her sari-sari store in front of her house. She saw appellant arrive around 5:00 p.m. and a few minutes later, come to her store to buy a cigarette. She also disclosed that Rosalinda and Riolyn never went to the ricefield and just stayed in their house all day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant assailed the credibility of Riolyn by presenting her teachers, Florida Monce and Salome Tiong, who testified that they had already dropped Riolyn from their classes prior to September 22, 1999. Thus, Riolyn was lying when she testified that she came from school before the alleged rape incident.<br><br>Appellant also assailed the credibility of his wife Rosalinda and argued that her motive in testifying against him was to get back at him for maltreating her. To prove his point, he presented SPO3 Fausto Marzan who testified that, on September 23, 1999, the day after the alleged rape incident, Rosalinda reported to the police that her husband mauled her but failed to mention the alleged rape of Riolyn.<br><br>On June 19, 2000, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT is hereby rendered, CONVICTING ROMEO ECLERA, SR. of Rape aggravated by relationship between father and daughter aged below 18 years old and the court sentences ROMEO ECLERA, SR. to suffer the penalty of DEATH to be implemented in the manner as provided for by law; the accused is likewise ordered to indemnify Riolyn Eclera the sum of P75,000.00 for moral damages and another sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages without any subsidiary imprisonment.<br><br>The Branch Clerk of Court of this court is hereby ordered to prepare the mittimus and to transmit the whole records of this case to the Supreme Court of the Philippines for automatic review immediately.<br><br>The Warden, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), Urdaneta District Jail, Urdaneta City, Pangasinan, is hereby ordered to deliver the living body of Romeo Eclera, Sr. to the National Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City, immediately upon receipt of this Decision.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>In his Brief, appellant assigns the following errors:<br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ACCORDING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT DESPITE ITS LACK OF CREDIBILITY.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>The Solicitor General recommends that the decision of the trial court be affirmed, the same being in accordance with law and the evidence on record, subject, however, to a modification on the award for exemplary damages which should be decreased from P50,000 to P25,000 pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br>After a careful study of the records, we are convinced that the appellant is guilty of qualified rape.<br><br>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659, provides that rape maybe committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman through force and intimidation. In the case at bar, the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant raped his daughter Riolyn by having carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation. His denial cannot prevail over her positive and categorical testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which the trial court found to be truthful:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="center">FISCAL TOMBOC: In what particular part of your house were you when you were changing your clothes then?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="10%"> <br></td><td width="90%"> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>In my room, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>While you were changing your clothes in your room, was there any incident that happened?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>There was, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>What was that?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><p>My father entered the room, sir.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>When your father entered the room, what did he do?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He went at my back and he held my breast and kissed my lips.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>So when your father went at your back, held your breast, kissed your lips, what happened next?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He pushed me on the cement, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>What is this cement you are referring to?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">COURT:</td><td>You are referring to the flooring?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">FISCAL TOMBOC: What part of the house is that flooring?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>In my room, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>So, he pushed you to the cemented flooring of the room?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><p>Yes, sir.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">So at that time when your father pushed you to the cemented flooring of the room, what was your position when he pushed you to the cemented flooring?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>I was able to lie down on the cemented flooring, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>After that when you were made to lie down on that cemented flooring by your father, what else happened?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He held both of my hands, raised my shirt and lowered my shorts together with my panty.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">COURT:</td><td>How can he do that when he was holding both of your hands?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Because he went on top of me, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>He held both of your hands?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>After holding both of your hands, what else did he do?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He removed his pants, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>On you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>He forced his organ to insert (sic) in my vagina.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>Not yet.

This physical finding was consistent with Riolyn's testimony that she was raped by appellant on September 22, 1999, which was more than a month before her physical examination by Dr. Araos-Liberato on October 26, 1999.<br><br>Appellant tries to assail the credibility of Riolyn. There being no other witness to the rape, the conviction of appellant indeed hinges on her credibility. He argues that Riolyn should not be believed because she is a liar. She testified that, on the day of the alleged rape, she came from school but this was belied by her teachers who testified that they had already dropped her from their classes as early as September 1, 1999. Also, there was a discrepancy between her complaint-affidavit and her testimony in open court. Appellant points out that, in her affidavit, Riolyn stated that the appellant was not able to penetrate her since she was able to kick him. But, during the trial, she testified that appellant was able to penetrate her.<br><br>The Court is not convinced. Riolyn's testimony is positive, categorical and consistent. Although two of Riolyn's professors testified that she was already dropped from their classes, it was not conclusive that she stopped schooling altogether. The certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> issued by both professors that she had been dropped from their classes was not a certification from the school itself. It was not even signed by the dean or the registrar and thus, could not be taken as evidence that she had completely ceased attending school, that is, there must have been other subjects that she was still attending.<br><br>Moreover, the Court finds no discrepancy at all between Riolyn's complaint-affidavit and testimony in open court.

We quote the explanation of the Solicitor General regarding this point:<br><blockquote>Appellant also points to an alleged inconsistency between Rosalinda Eclera's affidavit-complaint and her testimony. According to appellant, the said affidavit-complaint merely states that Riolyn Eclera was almost raped and that appellant inserted his fingers to his daughter's vagina while her court declaration was that appellant raped Riolyn Eclera (p. 7, Appellant's Brief).<br><br>The claim is misleading.<br><br>The record of this case made available to the Office of the Solicitor General reveals that there is no such Affidavit-Complaint dated October 25,<i> </i>1999, purportedly executed by Rosalinda Eclera in connection with this case. What is extant in the record is an Affidavit dated October 23, 1999 executed by Rosalinda Eclera which was subscribed and sworn to before Judge Hilarion A. Suller.<br><br>Even a cursory reading of the same affidavit, however, reveals that nothing is mentioned therein by Rosalinda Eclera that "Riolyn Eclera was almost raped and that appellant inserted his fingers to his daughter (sic) vagina."<br><br>For clarity, the complete text of Roalinda (sic) Eclera's Affidavit dated October 23, 1999 is quoted hereunder:<br><ol type="1"><li> That I am the wife of Romeo Eclera who is presently accused of the crime of Rape for several counts pending before the 7th MCTC, Asingan-San Miguel, Pangasinan;<br><br></li><li> That when we filed a case we were threatened by my husband Romeo Eclera and for many times he used to point his 45<i> </i>caliber gun against all of us;<br><br></li><li> That he has in his possession at least five (5)<i> </i>firearms namely, one 45<i> </i>caliber, one 38 caliber revolver, one grenade, one armalite and one shotgun which he keeps sometimes in our house, the other he keeps in (sic) his friends and neighbors in the community;<br><br></li><li> That because of the threats that we received from him I respectfully pray to this Honorable Court to issue a search warrant before something untoward will happen to us (p. 14, Record).</li></ol>It is noted, however, that during her cross-examination, Rosalinda Eclera identified an affidavit-complaint, the date of which was not even mentioned, which she purportedly signed. Assuming, that this is the same Affidavit dated October 25, 1999 allegedly executed by Rosalinda Eclera and, it in fact exists, the same, however, cannot dent the prosecution's evidence.
