				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On December 19, 2000, in Criminal Case Nos. U-10628 and U-10629, the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Branch 46, found appellant Freddie Fontanilla guilty of rape and imposed upon him the penalty of death.<br><br>The inculpatory portions of the two Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed against appellant in June 2000 read as follows:<br><br><center><u>Criminal Case No. U-10628</u></center><blockquote>That on or sometime in the month of November, 1999, at Brgy. Banuar, Laoac, Pangasinan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a stepfather and relative by affinity within the third civil degree of herein complainant, Methel Kathleen Fernandez, a minor, 14 years old, through force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said complainant, against her will, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY to Article 335, Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act Nos. 7659 and 8353.<br><br><center><u>Criminal Case No. U-10629</u></center><br>That on or sometime in January, 2000 at Brgy. Banuar, Laoac, Pangasinan and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a stepfather and relative by affinity within the third civil degree of herein complainant Methel Kathleen Fernandez, a minor, 14 years old, through force, threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with said complainant, against her will, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY to Art. 335, Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act Nos. 7659 and 8353.</blockquote>When arraigned on July 5, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> appellant, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charges, whereupon joint trial commenced.<br><br>Culled from the records of the case are the following facts established by the prosecution:<br><br>Private complainant Methel Kathleen Fernandez was born in Manaoag, Pangasinan on November 30, 1984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>.<br><br>On January 21, 1986, Esmeralda Ramos, who claimed to be Methel's mother, albeit the registered name of her mother is Esmeralda's sister Carmelita Fernandez, married appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The couple begot four children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Methel stayed with the couple and the four children.<br><br>Sometime in November 1999, after watching television, the then 14-year old Methel went to the bedroom which she shared with her family to retire for the evening. Her "mother" not having arrived,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> she did not lock the door to the room. While she was asleep as were her "half-siblings," she was roused when appellant approached her. As she inquired from him why, he proceeded to remove her short pants and panty after which he removed his own short pants and underwear. He then went on top of her and held his penis and inserted it into her vagina which caused her pain, he making push and pull movements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She attempted to push him away but to no avail as he firmly held her hands. After sometime, sensing that somebody arrived in the house, he put on his underwear and short pants and left. As she was crying, she too put on her short pants and panty. Appellant having threatened to kill her "mother" should she divulge what he did to her,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> she did not report it to anybody.<br><br>Sometime in the second week of January 2000, at nighttime, again while her "half-siblings," the eldest of which was 10 years old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> were sleeping, Methel sensed that appellant was "at [her] back." Telling her to sleep, he proceeded to remove his short pants and underwear and then removed her short pants and panty and inserted his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Her efforts to push him away were fruitless as he was too strong. After making push and pull movements, appellant ejaculated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He then put on his underwear and short pants and was about to sleep beside her half-siblings when somebody knocked on their bedroom door. Appellant thereupon checked who it was and it turned out to be Methel's "mother" Esmeralda, who "came to know what he did to [her]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> as she (Esmeralda) "was peeping at the window of our room" when he was "doing the act"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Her mother thus shouted at him and told Methel to sleep with her.<br><br>On April 14, 2000, Methel, accompanied by Esmeralda, went to the Laoac, Pangasinan Police Station where she executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> reporting the rape incidents. On the same day, they proceeded to the Provincial Prosecutor's Office at Urdaneta, Pangasinan where Methel filed the criminal complaints of even date against appellant. Still on the same day, they went to the Don Amadeo J. Perez, Sr. Memorial General Hospital in Urdaneta where Dr. Bernando C. Macaraeg conducted a physical examination on her which yielded the following results:<br><blockquote>External Genitalia - nulliparous introitus, no abrasions, no lacerations.<br><br>Internal Genitalia - Hymen with healed superficial lacerations at 5, 7 and 11 o'clock positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>In mid 2000, Methel, on the advice of Esmeralda "because of the gossip [going on] in [the] place,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> left the family residence for Marikina where she has since been living with an aunt.<br><br>Appellant denied the accusations. Esmeralda in fact testified for appellant, she denying having witnessed the alleged rape on the second week of January 2000 and even proffering that on the dates of the alleged incidents, he was not in their house.<br><br>The trial court found appellant guilty as charged in its decision on review, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads <i>verbatim</i> as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, JUDGMENT is hereby rendered:<br><ol type="1"><li> In CRIM. CASE NO. U-10628, CONVICTING FREDDIE FONTANILLA beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and the Court sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH to be implemented in the manner as provided for by law; to indemnify Methel Kathleen Fernandez the sum of P75,000.00 as moral damages and the further sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br><br></li><li> In CRIM. CASE NO. U-10629, CONVICTING FREDDIE FONTANILLA beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and the Court sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH to be implemented in the manner as provided for by law; to indemnify Methel Kathleen Fernandez the sum of P75,000.00 as moral damages and the further sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.</li></ol>The Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to prepare the mitimus and to transmit the entire records of Crim. Cases Nos. U-10628 and U-10629 to the Honorable Supreme Court of the Philippines for automatic review.<br><br>The Jail Warden, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), Urdaneta District Jail, Urdaneta City, is hereby ordered to deliver the living person of Freddie Fontanilla to the National Bilibid Prisons, Muntinlupa City, immediately upon receipt of this Decision.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Appellant filed on February 8, 2001 a Motion for New Trial and To Defer Transfer of Accused to the National Penitentiary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> alleging that Methel had, a few days after the promulgation of the decision of the trial court, executed an affidavit of recantation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> wherein she stated that appellant never raped her and that all the allegations she made against him were not true, she having been "only couched and taught what to state and say" in her sworn statement and during the trial.<br><br>By Order of February 19, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the trial court denied appellant's motion.<br><br>Hence, the automatic review of the cases pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>Appellant maintains his innocence and assigns the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br></li><li> THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE INCREDULOUS TESTIMONY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<br><br></li><li> THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE AFFIDAVIT OF RECANTATION SUBMITTED BY THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Appellant, casting doubt on the motive of Methel in filing the cases against him, contends that her testimony reveals that even as a child, she deeply resented his relationship with Esmeralda, and that she disliked him as he was very strict with her and would not give her permission whenever she wanted to go out with her friends.<br><br>Appellant surmises that Methel wanted Esmeralda to leave him and when she did not have her way, she left Laoac after fabricating the rape charges against him. He surmises too that Methel was prevailed upon by her maternal uncle, Benjamin Ramos, to file the charges as he (appellant) did not allow her to go with him (Benjamin) to a beach when the latter invited her to go with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Assailing the credibility of Methel's testimony, appellant submits that it was impossible for her "half-siblings" to have remained asleep during the alleged rape incidents despite the commotion and outcry she claimed to have made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>And appellant harps on the testimony of Esmeralda that she did not see appellant having sexual intercourse with Methel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> on the second week of January 2000.<br><br>Finally, appellant faults the trial court for denying his motion for new trial.<br><br>After a considered review of the records of the cases, this Court affirms appellant's conviction.<br><br>Appellant's bare denial, juxtaposed with Methel's clear and categorical account of the incidents, which account is replete with details that could have only been narrated by a victim thereof, deserves scant consideration. As did the trial court, this Court finds her testimony unfailing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus she declared:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0"

of the credibility of testimony of a complainant is entitled to great weight, absent any showing that some facts were overlooked which, if considered, would affect the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> A careful scrutiny of Methel's testimony yields no compelling reason to disturb the trial court's assessment thereof.<br><br>And as did the trial court, this Court finds the motive attributed to Methel to be too shallow to merit consideration. It is most improbable that a victim of tender years and one not exposed to the ways of the world would impute a crime so serious as rape to any man if what she claimed was not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Indeed, as has been repeatedly held, it is unnatural for a young and innocent girl to fabricate a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter subject herself to a public trial or ridicule if she had not, in fact, been a victim of rape and deeply motivated by a sincere desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As for appellant's submission that the rape incidents could not have occurred because Methel's "half-siblings" were beside them sleeping: The possibility of rape is not negated by the presence of even the whole family of the accused inside the same room and with the likelihood of being discovered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> For it is common judicial experience that rapists are not deterred from committing their odious act by the presence of people nearby,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> or while the rapist's spouse is asleep, or in a small room where other family members also sleep,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> or as in the cases at bar where the "half-siblings" of Methel were aged 10 and below and, therefore, were wont to sleep soundly.<br><br>That Esmeralda turned her back on Methel and testified for the defense do not militate against the credibility of Methel's testimony. It bears noting that when Methel went to the Laoac Police Station to report the rape incidents, she was even accompanied by Esmeralda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Her change of heart can most likely be attributed to a realization of the consequences of proving the charges against her husband including loss of the family's sole means of support, appellant being the breadwinner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Additionally, as this Court has held, some wives are overwhelmed by emotional attachment to their husbands such that they knowingly or otherwise suppress the truth and act as medium for injustice to preponderate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As for the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for new trial arising from Methel's affidavit of recantation: Said affidavit cannot qualify as newly discovered evidence to justify a new trial, the following requisites for which, and these must concur, are not present: (a) the evidence was discovered after the trial; (b) such evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; and (c) such evidence is material, not merely cumulative, corroborative, or impeaching, and is of such weight that, if admitted, would probably change the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Besides, affidavits of retraction of testimonies are generally looked with disfavor because there is always the probability that they may later be repudiated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x The unreliable character of this document is shown by the fact that it is quite incredible that after going through the process of having accused-appellant arrested by the police, positively identifying him as the person who raped her, enduring the humiliation of a physical examination of her private parts, and then repeating her accusations in open court by recounting her anguish, Maryjane would suddenly turn around and declare that "after a careful deliberation over the case, [she] find[s] that the same does not merit or warrant criminal prosecution.<br><br>Thus, we have declared that <u>at most the retraction is an afterthought which should not be given probative value.</u> It would be a dangerous rule to reject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the witness who has given it later on changed his mind for one reason or another. Such a rule will make a solemn trial a mockery and place the investigation at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>While appellant's liability for rape in both cases is upheld, this Court finds that the prosecution failed to establish the qualifying circumstance of relationship between Methel and appellant as alleged in the Informations. Relationship between Methel and appellant qualifies the crime of rape punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to rape punishable by death under Republic Act No. 8353. Under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R. A. 8353, the death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with the following pertinent attendant circumstances:<br><blockquote>x x x<br><ol type="1"><li> When the victim is under <b>eighteen (18) years of age</b> and the offender is a parent, ascendant, <b>step-parent</b>, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</li></ol></blockquote>Following jurisprudence, when the law specifies certain circumstances that will qualify an offense and thus attach to it a greater degree of penalty, such circumstances must both be <u>alleged</u> and <u>proven</u> in order to justify the imposition of the graver penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>That appellant and Esmeralda were married is documented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> And so is Methel's minority. The certification issued by the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of Manaoag, Pangasinan shows, however, as priorly stated, that her mother is Carmelita Fernandez, the sister of Esmeralda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The explanation given by appellant that when Methel was baptized another sister of Esmeralda instructed the latter to make it appear that Methel is the daughter of Carmelita and the latter's husband Anthony Fernandez who did not have a daughter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> does not suffice to overturn the <i>prima facie</i> truth of such entry in a public document, the acknowledgement of Esmeralda that Methel is her daughter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and appellant's admission that Methel is his stepdaughter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> notwithstanding.<br><br>Considering that the relationship of accused-appellant to complainant qualifies the crime of rape punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to rape punishable by death, it is but proper that <u>a more stringent proof of relationship between the offender and the offended party must be established</u> by the prosecution. Corollarily, a clearer proof of relationship between the complainant and the spouse of accused-appellant must be presented. <u>The relationship of accused-appellant and the complainant is not adequately substantiated since it is merely based on the testimony of the complainant, her mother's testimony and the accused-appellant's use of the words,</u> "mama at papa" in his letters. Needless to say, the evidence presented are not sufficient to dispel doubts about the true relationship of accused-appellant and the complainant, to the benefit of which the accused is entitled. <u>Where the life of an accused-appellant hangs in the balance, a more exacting proof must be adduced.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>The penalty imposed on appellant must thus be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>A word on the damages awarded by the trial court. While moral damages were awarded, indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> was not. The civil indemnity, which is distinct from and awarded in addition to moral damages which are based on different jural foundations and assessed by the court in the exercise of sound discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> is automatically given to the offended party without need of further evidence other than the fact of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Hence, appellant should, under the circumstances of the cases, likewise be ordered to pay the amount of P50,000.00 for each count of rape.<br><br>As for the award by the trial court of exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 for each count of rape, since relationship as an aggravating circumstance was not proven and no other aggravating circumstance was alleged and proven, the award must be deleted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Branch 46 in Criminal Case Nos.
