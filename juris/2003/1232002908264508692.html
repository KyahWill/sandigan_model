On January 26, 2000, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the decision of the trial court. It ruled that notwithstanding the absence of Ignacia's consent to the sale, the same must be held valid in favor of respondents because they were innocent purchasers for value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The decretal potion of the appellate court's decision states -<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision appealed from and the Orders dated May 31, 1990 and June 29, 1990, are SET ASIDE and in lieu thereof a new one is rendered -<br><ol type="1"><li> Declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 1, 1983 executed by Vicente Reyes in favor of spouses Cipriano and [Florentina] Mijares valid and lawful;<br><br></li><li> Ordering Vicente Reyes to pay spouses Mijares the amount of P30,000.00 as attorney's fees and legal expenses; and<br><br></li><li> Ordering Vicente Reyes to pay spouses Mijares P50,000.00 as moral damages.</li></ol>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>Undaunted by the denial of their motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> petitioners filed the instant petition contending that the assailed sale of Lot No. 4392-B-2 should be annulled because respondent spouses were not purchasers in good faith.<br><br>The issues for resolution are as follows: (1) What is the status of the sale of Lot No. 4349-B-2 to respondent spouses? (2) Assuming that the sale is annullable, should it be annulled in its entirety or only with respect to the share of Ignacia? (3) Are respondent spouses purchasers in good faith?<br><br>Articles 166 and 173 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the governing laws at the time the assailed sale was contracted, provide:<br><blockquote>Art.166. Unless the wife has been declared a <i>non compos mentis</i> or a spendthrift, or is under civil interdiction or is confined in a leprosarium, the husband cannot alienate or encumber any real property of the conjugal partnership without the wife's consent. If she refuses unreasonably to give her consent, the court may compel her to grant the same...<br><br>Art. 173. The wife may, during the marriage and within ten years from the transaction questioned, ask the courts for the annulment of any contract of the husband entered into without her consent, when such consent is required, or any act or contract of the husband which tends to defraud her or impair her interest in the conjugal partnership property. Should the wife fail to exercise this right, she or her heirs after the dissolution of the marriage, may demand the value of property fraudulently alienated by the husband.</blockquote>Pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the husband could not alienate or encumber any conjugal real property without the consent, express or implied, of the wife otherwise, the contract is voidable. Indeed, in several cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court had ruled that such alienation or encumbrance by the husband is void. The better view, however, is to consider the transaction as merely voidable and not void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This is consistent with Article 173 of the Civil Code pursuant to which the wife could, during the marriage and within 10 years from the questioned transaction, seek its annulment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Heirs of Christina Ayuste v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> it was categorically held that -<br><blockquote>There is no ambiguity in the wording of the law. A sale of real property of the conjugal partnership made by the husband without the consent of his wife is voidable. The action for annulment must be brought during the marriage and within ten years from the questioned transaction by the wife. Where the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no room for interpretation -- there is room only for application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>Likewise, in <i>Spouses Guiang v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court quoted with approval the ruling of the trial court that under the Civil Code, the encumbrance or alienation of a conjugal real property by the husband absent the wife's consent, is voidable and not void. Thus -<br><blockquote>...Under Article 166 of the Civil Code, the husband cannot generally alienate or encumber any real property of the conjugal partnership without the wife's consent. The alienation or encumbrance if so made however is not null and void. It is merely voidable. The offended wife may bring an action to annul the said alienation or encumbrance. Thus, the provision of Article 173 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, to wit:<br><blockquote>Art. 173. The wife may, during the marriage and within ten years from the transaction questioned, ask the courts for the annulment of any contract of the husband entered into without her consent, when such consent is required, or any act or contract of the husband which tends to defraud her or impair her interest in the conjugal partnership property. Should the wife fail to exercise this right, she or her heirs after the dissolution of the marriage, may demand the value of property fraudulently alienated by the husband.</blockquote>This particular provision giving the wife ten (10) years x x x during [the] marriage to annul the alienation or encumbrance was not carried over to the Family Code. It is thus clear that any alienation or encumbrance made after August 3, 1988 when the Family Code took effect by the husband of the conjugal partnership property without the consent of the wife is null and void...</blockquote>In the case at bar, there is no dispute that Lot No. 4349-B-2, is a conjugal property having been purchased using the conjugal funds of the spouses during the subsistence of their marriage. It is beyond cavil therefore that the sale of said lot to respondent spouses without the knowledge and consent of Ignacia is voidable. Her action to annul the March 1, 1983 sale which was filed on June 4, 1986, before her demise is perfectly within the 10 year prescriptive period under Article 173 of the Civil Code. Even if we reckon the period from November 25, 1978 which was the date when Vicente and the respondent spouses entered into a contract concerning Lot No. 4349-B-2, Ignacia's action would still be within the prescribed period.<br><br>Anent the second issue, the trial court correctly annulled the voidable sale of Lot No. 4349-B-2 in its entirety. In <i>Bucoy v. Paulino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> a case involving the annulment of sale with assumption of mortgages executed by the husband without the consent of the wife, it was held that the alienation or encumbrance must be annulled in its entirety and not only insofar as the share of the wife in the conjugal property is concerned. Although the transaction in the said case was declared void and not merely voidable, the rationale for the annulment of the whole transaction is the same thus -<br><blockquote>The plain meaning attached to the plain language of the law is that the contract, in its entirety, executed by the husband without the wife's consent, may be annulled by the wife. Had Congress intended to limit such annulment in so far as the contract shall "prejudice" the wife, such limitation should have been spelled out in the statute. It is not the legitimate concern of this Court to recast the law. As Mr. Justice Jose B. L. Reyes of this Court and Judge Ricardo C. Puno of the Court of First Instance correctly stated, "[t]he rule (in the first sentence of Article 173) revokes Baello vs. Villanueva, 54 Phil. 213 and Coque vs. Navas Sioca, 45 Phil. 430," in which cases annulment was held to refer only to the extent of the one-half interest of the wife...<br><br>The necessity to strike down the contract of July 5, 1963 as a whole, not merely as to the share of the wife, is not without its basis in the common-sense rule. To be underscored here is that upon the provisions of Articles 161, 162 and 163 of the Civil Code, the conjugal partnership is liable for many obligations while the conjugal partnership exists. Not only that. The conjugal property is even subject to the payment of debts contracted by either spouse before the marriage, as those for the payment of fines and indemnities imposed upon them after the responsibilities in Article 161 have been covered (Article 163, par. 3), if it turns out that the spouse who is bound thereby, "should have no exclusive property or if it should be insufficient." These are considerations that go beyond the mere equitable share of the wife in the property. These are reasons enough for the husband to be stopped from disposing of the conjugal property without the consent of the wife. Even more fundamental is the fact that the nullity is decreed by the Code not on the basis of prejudice but lack of consent of an indispensable party to the contract under Article 166.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>With respect to the third issue, the Court finds that respondent spouses are not purchasers in good faith. A purchaser in good faith is one who buys property of another, without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays full and fair price for the same, at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claim or interest of some other persons in the property. He buys the property with the belief that the person from whom he receives the thing was the owner and could convey title to the property. A purchaser cannot close his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man on his guard and still claim he acted in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, there existed circumstances that should have placed respondent spouses on guard. The death certificate of Ignacia, shows that she died on <b>March 22, 1982</b>. The same death certificate, however, reveals that - (1) it was issued by the Office of the Civil Registrar of Lubao Pampanga on <b>March 10, 1982</b>; (2) the alleged death of Ignacia was reported to the Office of the Civil Registrar on <b>March 4, 1982</b>; and (3) her burial or cremation would be on <b>March 8, 1982</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> These obvious flaws in the death certificate should have prompted respondents to investigate further, especially so that respondent Florentina Mijares admitted on cross examination that she asked for the death certificate of Ignacia because she was suspicious that Ignacia was still alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Moreover, respondent spouses had all the opportunity to verify the claim of Vicente that he is a widower because it was their lawyer, Atty. Rodriguito S. Saet, who represented Vicente in the special proceedings before the Metropolitan Trial Court.<br><br>Neither can respondent spouses rely on the alleged court approval of the sale. Note that the Order issued by the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch XXXI, appointing Vicente as guardian of his 5 minor children, as well as the Order authorizing him to sell the estate of Ignacia were issued only on September 29, 1983 and October 14, 1983, respectively. On the other hand, the sale of the entire Lot No. 4349-B-2 to respondent spouses appears to have been made not on March 1, 1983, but even as early as November 25, 1978. In the "Agreement" dated November 25, 1978, Vicente in consideration of the amount of P110,000.00, sold to Cipriano Mijares Lot No. 4349-B-2 on installment basis, with the first installment due on or before July 31, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This was followed by a "Memorandum of Understanding" executed on July 30, 1979, by Vicente and Cipriano - (1) acknowledging Cipriano's receipt of Vicente's down payment in the amount of P50,000.00; and (2) authorizing Florentina Mijares to collect rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> On July 14, 1981, Vicente and Cipriano executed another "Memorandum of Agreement," stating, among other, that out of the purchase price of P110,000.00 Vicente had remaining balance of P19,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Clearly therefore, the special proceedings before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch XXXI, could not have been the basis of respondent spouses' claim of good faith because the sale of Lot No. 4349-B-2 occurred prior thereto.<br><br>Respondent spouses cannot deny knowledge that at the time of the sale in 1978, Vicente was married to Ignacia and that the latter did not give her conformity to the sale. This is so because the 1978 "Agreement" described Vicente as "married" but the conformity of his wife to the sale did not appear in the deed. Obviously, the execution of another deed of sale in 1983 over the same Lot No. 4349-B-2, after the alleged death of Ignacia on March 22, 1982, as well as the institution of the special proceedings were, intended to correct the absence of Ignacia's consent to the sale. Even assuming that respondent spouses believed in good faith that Ignacia really died on March 22, 1982, after they purchased the lot, the fact remains that the sale of Lot No. 4349-B-2 prior to Ignacia's alleged demise was without her consent and therefore subject to annulment. The October 14, 1983 order authorizing the sale of the estate of Ignacia, could not have validated the sale of Lot No. 4349-B-2 because said order was issued on the assumption that Ignacia was already dead and that the sale dated March 1, 1983 was never categorically approved in the said order.<br><br>The fact that the 5 minor children<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of Vicente represented by the latter, signed the March 1, 1983 deed of sale of Lot No. 4349-B-2 will not estop them from assailing the validity thereof. Not only were they too young at that time to understand the repercussions of the sale, they likewise had no right to sell the property of their mother who, when they signed the deed, was very much alive.<br><br>If a voidable contract is annulled, the restoration of what has been given is proper. The relationship between parties in any contract even if subsequently annulled must always be characterized and punctuated by good faith and fair dealing. Hence, for the sake of justice and equity, and in consonance with the salutary principle of non-enrichment at another's expense, the Court sustains the trial court's order directing Vicente to refund to respondent spouses the amount of P110,000.00 which they have paid as purchase price of Lot No. 4349-B-2.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The court <i>a quo</i> correctly found that the subject of the sale was the entire Lot No. 4349-B-2 and that the consideration thereof is not P40,000.00 as stated in the March 1, 1983 deed of sale, but P110,000.00 as evidenced by the - (1) "Agreement" dated November 25, 1978 as well as the July 30, 1979 "Memorandum of Understanding" and the July 14, 1981 "Memorandum of Agreement" which served as receipts of the installment payments made by respondent Cipriano Mijares; and (2) the receipt duly signed by Vicente Reyes acknowledging receipt of the amount of P110,000.00 from respondent spouses as payment of the sale of the controverted lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The trial court, however, erred in imposing 12% interest per annum on the amount due the respondents. In <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> it was held that interest on obligations not constituting a loan or forbearance of money is six percent (6%) annually. If the purchase price could be established with certainty at the time of the filing of the complaint, the six percent (6%) interest should be computed from the date the complaint was filed until finality of the decision. In <i>Lui v. Loy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> involving a suit for reconveyance and annulment of title filed by the first buyer against the seller and the second buyer, the Court, ruling in favor of the first buyer and annulling the second sale, ordered the seller to refund to the second buyer (who was not a purchaser in good faith) the purchase price of the lots. It was held therein that the 6% interest should be computed from the date of the filing of the complaint by the first buyer. After the judgment becomes final and executory until the obligation is satisfied, the amount due shall earn interest at 12% per year, the interim period being deemed equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the amount of P110,000.00 due the respondent spouses which could be determined with certainty at the time of the filing of the complaint shall earn 6% interest per annum from June 4, 1986 until the finality of this decision. If the adjudged principal and the interest (or any part thereof) remain unpaid thereafter, the interest rate shall be twelve percent (12%) per annum computed from the time the judgment becomes final and executory until it is fully satisfied.<br><br>Petitioner's prayer for payment of rentals should be denied. Other than the allegation of Ignacia in her Sinumpaang Salaysay that the apartments could be rented at P1,000.00 a month, no other evidence was presented to substantiate her claim. In awarding rentals which are in the nature of actual damages, the Court cannot rely on mere assertions, speculations, conjectures or guesswork but must depend on competent proof and on the best evidence obtainable regarding the actual amount of loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> None, having been presented in the case at bar, petitioner's claim for rentals must be denied.<br><br>While as a general rule, a party who has not appealed is not entitled to affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the decision of the court below, law and jurisprudence authorize a tribunal to consider errors, although unassigned, if they involve (1) errors affecting the lower court's jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) plain errors not specified, and (3) clerical errors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In this case, though defendant Vicente Reyes did not appeal, the "plain error" committed by the court<i> a quo </i>as to the award of moral and exemplary damages must be corrected. These awards cannot be lumped together as was done by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Moral and exemplary damages are different in nature, and require separate determination. Moral damages are awarded where the claimant experienced physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury as a result of the act complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The award of exemplary damages, on the other hand, is warranted when moral, temperate, liquidated, or compensatory damages were likewise awarded by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Hence, the trial court's award of "P50,000.00 by way of moral and exemplary damages" should be modified.
