				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court are Motions for proclamation filed by various party-list participants.&nbsp; The ultimate question raised is this:&nbsp; Aside from those already validly proclaimed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> pursuant to earlier Resolutions of this Court, are there other party-list candidates that should be proclaimed winners? The answer to this question is circumscribed by the eight-point guideline given in our June 26, 2001 Decision in these consolidated cases, as well as by the four unique parameters of the Philippine party-list system:<br><blockquote><i>"First, the twenty percent allocation — </i>the<i> </i>combined number of <i>all </i>party-list congressmen shall not exceed twenty percent of the total membership of the House of Representatives, including those elected under the party-list.<br><br>"<i>Second, the two percent threshold </i>— only those parties garnering a minimum of two percent of the total valid votes cast for the party-list system are `qualified' to have a seat in the House of Representatives.<br><br>"<i>Third, the three-seat limit — </i>each qualified party, regardless of the number of votes it actually obtained, is entitled to a maximum of three seats; that is, one `qualifying' and two additional seats.<br><br>"<i>Fourth, proportional representation </i>— the additional seats which a qualified party is entitled to shall be computed `in proportion to their total number of votes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><b><u><center>The Antecedents</center></u></b><br>To fully understand the matter on hand, we deem it wise to recapitulate some relevant antecedents.<br><br>On June 26, 2001, the Court promulgated in these consolidated cases its Decision requiring Comelec to do the following:<br><blockquote>"x x x [I]mmediately conduct summary evidentiary hearings on the qualifications of the party-list participants in the light of the guidelines enunciated in this Decision. Considering the extreme urgency of determining the winners in the last party-list elections, the Comelec is directed to begin its hearings for the parties and organizations that appear to have garnered such number of votes as to qualify for seats in the House of Representatives. The Comelec is further <b><i>DIRECTED</i></b> to submit to this Court its compliance report within 30 days from notice hereof.<br><br>"The Resolution of this Court dated May 9, 2001, directing the Comelec `to refrain from proclaiming any winner' during the last party-list election, shall remain in force until after the Comelec itself will have complied and reported its compliance with the foregoing disposition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><i><b><u>Comelec's First Partial</u></b></i><br><i><b><u>Compliance Report</u></b></i><br><br>In its First Partial Compliance Report dated July 27, 2001, Comelec recommended that the following party-list participants be deemed to have hurdled the eight-point guideline referred to in the aforementioned Court Decision:<br><blockquote><ol><li>BAYAN MUNA (BAYAN MUNA)<br></li><li>AKBAYAN!

Comelec</i>, GR Nos. 136781, 136786, and 136795, October 6, 2000."<br><br>In its Consolidated Reply dated October 15, 2001, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), on behalf of the Comelec, recommended that — "except for the modification that the APEC, BUHAY, COCOFED and CIBAC be declared as having complied with the guidelines set forth in the June 26, 2001 Decision in the instant cases [—] the Partial Compliance Report dated July 27, 2001 be affirmed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; But because of (1) the conflicting Comelec reports regarding the qualifications of APEC and CIBAC and (2) the disparity in the percentage of votes obtained by AMIN, the Court in a Resolution dated November 13, 2001, required the parties to file within 20 days from notice their respective final position papers on why APEC, CIBAC, and/or AMIN should or should not be proclaimed winners in the last party-list elections.<br><br>Thereafter, in another Resolution dated January 29, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the Court agreed to qualify APEC and CIBAC, which had previously been disqualified by Comelec in its First Compliance Report. &nbsp;<br><br>Thus, in the same Resolution, the Court once more lifted its May 9, 2001 TRO to enable the Comelec to proclaim APEC and CIBAC as winners in the party-list elections.&nbsp; The Court said: <br><blockquote>"we accept Comelec's submission, per the OSG, that APEC and CIBAC have sufficiently met the 8-point guidelines of this Court and have garnered sufficient votes to entitle them to seats in Congress. Since these issues are factual in character, we are inclined to adopt the Commission's findings, absent any patent arbitrariness or abuse or negligence in its action. There is no substantial proof that CIBAC is merely an arm of JIL, or that APEC is an extension of PHILRECA. The OSG explained that these are separate entities with separate memberships. Although APEC's nominees are all professionals, its membership is composed not only of professionals but also of peasants, elderly, youth and women. Equally important, APEC addresses the issues of job creation, poverty alleviation and lack of electricity. Likewise, CIBAC is composed of the underrepresented and marginalized and is concerned with their welfare. CIBAC is particularly interested in the youth and professional sectors."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>To summarize, after the Court had accepted and approved the First Partial Compliance Report and its amendments, the following nominees were validly proclaimed winners: BAYAN MUNA (Satur C. Ocampo, Crispin B. Beltran and Liza L. Maza), AKBAYAN (Loretta Ann P. Rosales), BUTIL (Benjamin A. Cruz), APEC (Ernesto C. Pablo) and CIBAC (Joel J. Villanueva).<br><br><i><b><u>Comelec's Second Partial</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>Compliance Report</b></u></i><br><br>In its Second Compliance Report dated August 22, 2001 and received by this Court on August 28, 2001, Comelec recommended that the following party-list participants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> be deemed qualified under the Court's guidelines:<br><blockquote><ol>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ABANSE!

Comelec</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and related cases should be deemed applicable to the determination of winners in party-list elections<br><br>2)&nbsp; Whether the votes cast for parties/organizations that were subsequently disqualified for having failed to meet the eight-point guideline contained in our June 26, 2001 Decision should be deducted from the "total votes cast for the party-list system" during the said elections</ol></blockquote><b><u><center>The Court's Ruling</center></u></b><br>At the outset, the Court needs to pass upon the claims of the OSG that the initial recommendation contained in Comelec's First Compliance Report dated July 27, 2001, regarding BUHAY and COCOFED should be reconsidered, and that these two party-list groups should be deemed qualified. &nbsp;<br><br><i><b><u>Qualification of</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>BUHAY and COCOFED</b></u></i><br><br>In recommending the disqualification of BUHAY for being "most probably merely an extension of the El Shaddai," a religious group, Comelec said in the above-mentioned Report:<br><blockquote>"Upon hearing the case for BUHAY, the Commission determined that, based upon BUHAY's declarations of intent in its constitution, upon its avowed platform of government — which both mirror the sentiments of the El Shaddai Movement — and upon the circumstances surrounding its relationship with the El Shaddai Movement, BUHAY is most probably merely an extension of the El Shaddai.&nbsp; In this light, it is very likely that the relationship between the leader of the El Shaddai, and the nominee&nbsp; of BUHAY is less a matter of serendipity than an&nbsp; attempt to circumvent the statutory prohibition against sects or denominations from participating in the party-list elections."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>In the same Report, Comelec also stated that COCOFED did not deserve a seat in the House of Representatives, because it was allegedly an "adjunct of the government."&nbsp; Explained the Commission:<br><blockquote>"COCOFED is a sectoral party representing the peasantry.&nbsp; It is a non-stock, non-profit organization of coconut farmers and producers, established in 1947.&nbsp; It has no religious affiliations.&nbsp; However, the records indicate that it is an adjunct of the government.<br><br>"COCOFED's Amended By-Laws specifically provides that:<br><i></i><blockquote><i>`The Chairman of the Philippine Coconut Authority or his duly authorized representative shall automatically be a member of the National Board.</i></blockquote>The Philippine Coconut Authority is an administrative agency of the government which receives support and funding from the national government.&nbsp; Thus, to have the Chairman of the Philippine Coconut Authority sit on the National Board of COCOFED clearly amounts to `participation of the government in the affairs of candidate' which, as this Court has said, would be `unfair to the other parties,' and `deleterious to the objectives of the law.'<br><br>"Furthermore, in the Articles of Incorporation of COCOFED, it declared, as one of its primary purposes, the obtaining of `possible technical and financial assistance for industry development from private or governmental sources.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </blockquote>On the other hand, in its Consolidated Reply dated October 15, 2001, the OSG — in representation of the poll agency — argued that the above findings of the Comelec in regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to BUHAY and COCOFED are "not supported by substantial evidence" and, thus, "should be modified accordingly." This opinion is buttressed by the OSG's Comment dated November 15, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The OSG stressed that the Comelec report on BUHAY was "merely anchored on conjectures or speculations." On COCOFED, the OSG explained that the bylaws making the chairman of the Philippine Coconut Authority an automatic member of the COCOFED National Board "has already been deleted as early as May, 1988."<br><br>It added that while the primary purposes of COCOFED's Articles of Incorporation authorize the organization "to help explore and obtain possible technical and financial assistance for industry development from private or governmental sources x x x," this statement does not "by itself constitute such substantial evidence to support a conclusion that the COCOFED is an entity funded or assisted by the government."<br><br>We are convinced.&nbsp; For the same reasons that we concurred in the earlier accreditation of APEC and CIBAC, we accept the OSG's position that indeed Comelec erred in disqualifying BUHAY and COCOFED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Therefore, we now add these two groups to the list of 44 qualified groups earlier mentioned and thereby increase the total to 46.<br><br>We shall now take up the main question of which parties/organizations won during the last party-list election.<br><br><i><b><u>Legal Effect of the Disqualifications</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>on the "Total Votes Cast"</b></u></i><br><br>The instant Motions for proclamation contend that the disqualification of many party-list organizations has reduced the "total number of votes cast for the party-list elections." Because of this reduction, the two-percent benchmark required by law has now been allegedly attained by movants.&nbsp; Hence, they now pray for their proclamation as winners in the last party-list elections.<br><br>Recall that under Section 11(b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of RA 7941 (the Party-List Act), only those parties garnering a minimum of two percent of the total votes cast for the party-list system are entitled to have a seat in the House of Representatives. The critical question now is this: To determine the "total votes cast for the party-list system," should the votes tallied for the disqualified candidates be deducted?&nbsp; Otherwise stated, does the clause "total votes cast for the party-list system" include only those ballots cast for <i>qualified</i> party-list candidates?<br><br>To answer this question, there is a need to review related jurisprudence on the matter, especially <i>Labo v. Comelec</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <i>Grego v. Comelec</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which were mentioned in our February 18, 2003 Resolution.<br><br><u>Labo<i> <b>and </b></i><b>Grego<i></i></b><i> </i></u><br><i><u><b>Not Applicable</b></u> </i><br><br>In <i>Labo, </i>the Court declared that "the ineligibility of a candidate receiving majority votes does not entitle the eligible candidate receiving the next highest number of votes to be declared elected. A minority or defeated candidate cannot be deemed elected to the office."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; In other words, the votes cast for an ineligible or disqualified candidate cannot be considered "stray."<br><br>However, "this rule would be different if the electorate, fully aware in fact and in law of a candidate's disqualification so as to bring such awareness within the realm of notoriety, would nonetheless cast their votes in favor of the ineligible candidate.&nbsp; In such case, the electorate may be said to have waived the validity and efficacy of their votes by notoriously misapplying their franchise or throwing away their votes, in which case, the eligible candidate obtaining the next higher number of votes may be deemed elected."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In short, the votes cast for a "notoriously disqualified" candidate may be considered "stray" and excluded from the canvass.<br><br>The foregoing pronouncement was reiterated in <i>Grego,</i> which held that the exception mentioned in <i>Labo v. Comelec </i>"is predicated on the concurrence of two assumptions, namely: (1) the one who obtained the highest number of votes is disqualified; and (2) the electorate is fully aware in fact and in law of a candidate's disqualification so as to bring such awareness within the realm of notoriety but would nonetheless cast their votes in favor of the ineligible candidate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Note, however, that the foregoing pronouncements (1) referred to regular elections for local offices and (2) involved the interpretation of Section 6 of RA 6646.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; They were not meant to cover party-list elections, which are specifically governed by RA 7941.&nbsp; Section 10 of this latter law clearly provides that the votes cast for a party, a sectoral organization or a coalition "<i>not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted</i>"<i>:</i><br><blockquote>"SEC. 10. <i>Manner of Voting</i>. — Every voter shall be entitled to two (2) votes: the first vote is a vote for candidate for membership of the House of Representatives in his legislative district, and the second, a vote for the party, organization, or coalition he wants represented in the House of Representatives: <b><i>Provided</i>, That a vote cast for a party, sectoral organization, or coalition not entitled to be voted for shall not be counted</b>: <i>Provided, finally</i>, That the first election under the party-list system shall be held in May 1998."&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The language of the law is clear; hence, there is room, not for interpretation, but merely for application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, no recourse to extrinsic aids is warranted when the language of the law is plain and unambiguous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <br><br>Another reason for not applying <i>Labo</i> and <i>Grego</i> is that these cases involve single elective posts, while the present controversy pertains to the acquisition of a number of congressional seats depending on the total election results — such that even those garnering second, third, fourth or lesser places could be proclaimed winners depending on their compliance with other requirements.<br><br>RA 7941 is a special statute governing the elections of party-list representatives and is the controlling law in matters pertaining thereto.&nbsp; Since <i>Labo</i> and Section 6 of RA 6646 came into being prior to the enactment of RA 7941, the latter is a qualification of the former ruling and law.&nbsp; On the other hand, <i>Grego</i> and other related cases that came after the enactment of RA 7941 should be construed as inapplicable to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Subtracting the votes garnered by these disqualified party-list groups from the total votes cast under the party-list system will reduce the base figure to 6,523,185.&nbsp; This means that the two-percent threshold can be more easily attained by the <i>qualified</i> marginalized and under-represented groups. Hence, disregarding the votes of disqualified party-list participants will increase and broaden the number of representatives from these sectors.&nbsp; Doing so will further concretize and give flesh to the policy declaration in RA 7941, which we reproduce thus:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. — The State shall promote proportional representation in the election of representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system of registered, national and sectoral parties or organizations or coalitions thereof, which will enable Filipino citizens belonging to marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to the enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible."</blockquote><i><b><u>Need for Patience</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>and Perseverance</b></u></i><br><br>BAYAN MUNA contends that the deduction of votes obtained by party-list candidates disqualified <i>after</i> the holding of the party-list elections will result in the instability of the system.&nbsp; The reason is that qualified party-list candidates would be encouraged to seek the disqualification of the other candidates for the sole purpose of attaining the needed percentage of the votes cast.&nbsp; Although such scenario may be possible, we believe that the perceived "instability" can be alleviated because, (1) unlike in the past elections, Comelec now has the herein qualified and disqualified participants' list, which can be used for future elections; and (2) in the light of recent jurisprudential developments, Comelec will now be guided accordingly when accrediting new candidates for the next party-list elections and will be able to set the period for accreditation in such time and manner as&nbsp; to enable it to determine their qualifications long before the elections are held.<br><br>Indeed, it takes patience and perseverance to have the marginalized and under-represented sectors ably represented in Congress. The controversies churned during the 1998 and the 2001 party-list elections should further embolden, not distract, the nation in the process of implementing a genuine and sound Philippine-style party-list system.&nbsp; At this point, the Court needs to stress what it said in <i>Veterans</i>:<br><blockquote>"[T]he dismal result of the first election for party-list representatives should serve as a challenge to our sectoral parties and organizations.&nbsp; It should stir them to be more active and vigilant in their campaign for representation in the State's lawmaking body.&nbsp; It should also serve as a clarion call for innovation and creativity in adopting this novel system of popular democracy.<br><br>"With adequate information and dissemination to the public and more active sectoral parties, we are confident our people will be more responsive to future party-list elections. Armed with patience, perseverance and perspicacity, our marginalized sectors, in time, will fulfill the Filipino dream of full representation in Congress under the aegis of the party-list system, Philippine style."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote>We also take this opportunity to emphasize that the formulas devised in <i>Veterans</i> for computing the number of nominees that the party-list winners are entitled to cannot be disregarded by the concerned agencies of government, especially the Commission on Elections.&nbsp; These formulas ensure that the number of seats allocated to the winning party-list candidates conform to the principle of proportional representation mandated by the law.<br><br><i><b><u>The Party-List Winners</u></b></i><br><br>As discussed earlier, the votes obtained by disqualified party-list candidates are not to be counted in determining the total votes cast for the party-list system.&nbsp; In the present cases, the votes they obtained should be deducted from the canvass of the total number of votes cast during the May 14, 2001 elections.&nbsp; Consequently, following Section 12 of RA 7941, a new tally and ranking of qualified party-list candidates is now in order, according to the percentage of votes they obtained as compared with the total valid votes cast nationwide.<br><br>Accordingly, we will now tally and rank the qualified party-list participants during the last elections, pursuant to the approved Comelec Compliance Reports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and our various Resolutions in these consolidated cases.&nbsp; Based on our foregoing discussion, we will deduct the votes obtained by the 116<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> disqualified candidates from the total votes cast for the May 14, 2001 elections.&nbsp; The votes for these disqualified groups total 8,595,630. Subtracting this figure from 15,118,815 (the total votes cast as reported in the Compliance Reports) will result in a new total of 6,523,185 valid votes cast for the May 14, 2001 party-list elections.&nbsp; This new figure representing the votes cast for the 46 qualified party-list participants will now be the basis for computing the two-percent threshold for victory and the number of seats the winners are entitled to. <br><br>To repeat, there are only 46 qualified party-list participants.&nbsp; Be it remembered that the Commission recommended for qualification only 42 party-list candidates in its three Compliance Reports.&nbsp; To this figure should be added the two participants we approved in our January 29, 2002 Resolution, plus another two (BUHAY and COCOFED) per our earlier discussion in this ruling.&nbsp; Table No. 1 below-lists the 46 qualified parties.<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="4"><div align="center"><b>Table No. 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></b></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="12%"><div align="center"><b>Rank</b></div></td> <td width="35%"><div align="center"> Party-List Group </div></td> <td width="25%"><div align="center">Votes Cast</div></td> <td width="28%"><div align="center">Percentage to Total Votes Cast (%)  </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">1 </div></td> <td>BAYAN MUNA <br></td> <td><div align="center">1,708,253 </div></td> <td><div align="center">26.19</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">2 </div></td> <td>APEC </td> <td><div align="center">802,060 </div></td> <td><div align="center">12.29</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">3 </div></td> <td>AKBAYAN! </td> <td><div align="center">377,852 </div></td> <td><div align="center">5.79</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">4 </div></td> <td>BUTIL</td> <td><div align="center"> 330,282 </div></td> <td><div align="center">5.06</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">5 </div></td> <td>CIBAC</td> <td><div align="center"> 323,810 </div></td> <td><div align="center">4.96</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">6 </div></td> <td>BUHAY </td> <td><div align="center">290,760 </div></td> <td><div align="center">4.46</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">7</div></td> <td> AMIN </td> <td><div align="center">252,051 </div></td> <td><div align="center">3.86</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">8 </div></td> <td>ABA </td> <td><div align="center">242,199 </div></td> <td><div align="center">3.71</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">9</div></td> <td> COCOFED </td> <td><div align="center">229,165 </div></td> <td><div align="center">3.51 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">10</div></td> <td> PM</td> <td><div align="center"> 216,823 </div></td> <td><div align="center">3.32 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">11</div></td> <td> SANLAKAS<br></td> <td><div align="center"> 151,017 </div></td> <td><div align="center">2.31</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">12 </div></td> <td>ABANSE!

It cannot be used to determine the number of additional seats of the other qualified parties. As explained earlier, the use of the same formula for all would contravene the proportional representation parameter. For example, a second party obtains six percent of the total number of votes cast. According to the above formula, the said party would be entitled to two additional seats or a total of three seats overall. However, if the first party received a significantly higher amount of votes — say, twenty percent — to grant it the same number of seats as the second party would violate the statutory mandate of proportional representation, since a party getting only six percent of the votes will have an equal number of representatives as the one obtaining twenty percent. The proper solution, therefore, is to grant the first party a total of three seats; and the party receiving six percent, additional seats in proportion to those of the first party." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>As adverted to earlier, the issue of whether <i>additional</i> seats should be allocated to APEC, AKBAYAN, BUTIL and CIBAC will not be addressed in this Resolution; a separate Motion (with Supplemental Motion) challenging their entitlement thereto has been filed by BAYAN MUNA and is still pending completion as of this writing.&nbsp; Hence, we shall compute only the <i>additional</i> seat or seats to be allocated, if any, to the other qualified parties — BUHAY, AMIN, ABA, COCOFED, PM, SANLAKAS and ABANSE!

Principles and precedents in other democracies of the world have not been very helpful, because our party-list law (RA 7941) has earmarked unique parameters, giving rise to an equally distinctive Philippine-style party-list system.&nbsp; Our difficulties have also been aggravated by the less than firm actions of the Commission on Elections referred to earlier, which had to be reversed based on the OSG's later submissions.<br><br>To help all concerned, especially the Commission on Elections, speed up the process of determining the party-list winners in the future, we deem it wise to summarize the implementing process we followed in this Resolution, as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>After the promulgation of our Decision on June 26, 2001, we directed Comelec to conduct a factual determination as to which of the various party-list candidates had passed the eight-point guideline we instituted in that Decision. Although we gave Comelec only 30 days to undertake the work, it was able to submit its Final Compliance Report only on September 27, 2001.<br><br></li><li>Of the various parties and organizations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which Comelec allowed to participate in the 2001 party-list elections, it recommended — in its three Compliance Reports to the Court — 42 to be qualified.&nbsp; Later on, four more groups were added, for a total of 46.<br><br></li><li>Next, we determined which of the 46 qualified parties garnered at least two percent of the total votes cast for the party-list system.&nbsp; To do so, we subtracted the votes obtained by the disqualified candidates from the "total votes cast."&nbsp; Those parties, organizations and coalitions that had obtained at least two percent of this balance were declared winners.<br><br></li><li>After identifying the winners, we determined, by using the formulas mandated in <i>Veterans v. Comelec</i>, how many nominees each winning party was entitled to.<br><br></li><li>The foregoing process would have been finished long ago and the winners proclaimed before the end of the year 2002, had Comelec been more resolute and exacting in the factual determinations contained in its Compliance Reports. &nbsp;<br><br></li><li>In the interest of due process, the Court required Position Papers on the issue of whether the votes of disqualified candidates should be deducted from the "total votes cast" nationwide.<br><br></li><li>The two <i>rollos</i> of these two consolidated cases contain about 14,000 pages, because almost all of the original party-list participants filed — some repeatedly — motions, pleas, position papers and so on, which all needed attention.&nbsp; Thus, the Court had to devote an enormous amount of time and effort poring over, understanding, and ruling upon these submissions.<br><br></li><li>In the interest of speedy justice, this matter was deliberated upon; and this Resolution was discussed, finalized and promulgated by the Court within weeks after it had received the last Position Paper mentioned in item 6 above.</li></ol></blockquote>IN THE FUTURE, the determination of the winners can truly be made much more expeditiously, now that there are precedents to guide all concerned, especially the Commission on Elections. For one thing, Comelec already has the herein base list of 46 qualified parties.&nbsp; For another, given the lessons and experiences in these proceedings, it can now more speedily, more carefully and more prudently pass upon the qualifications of new candidates.&nbsp; Such process can even be done in advance under such rules and regulations it may issue, consistent with the law and with our Decisions and Resolutions here and in <i>Veterans</i>, to pre-qualify participants well in advance of the elections.<br><br>In closing, the Court hopes that, with each bit of wisdom they learned and after the arduous journey they experienced in our one-of-a-kind Philippine-style party-list system, the marginalized and under-represented sectors of our country will be accorded ever-widening opportunities to participate in nation-building, so that they can help develop — in peace and harmony — a society that is just, humane, progressive and free.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <i><b>HOLD</b></i> that, having obtained at least two percent of the total valid votes cast in the last party-list elections, the following qualified participants are <i><b>DECLARED</b></i> elected with one nominee each: BUHAY, AMIN, ABA, COCOFED, PM, SANLAKAS and ABANSE!
