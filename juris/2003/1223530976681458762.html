The dispositive portion of the appellate court's decision reads, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31] </sup><br><blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED with <i>modifications</i> as to <i> penalty</i> and <i>civil indemnity</i>.&nbsp;

P50,000.00.&nbsp; (Emphasis, underscoring and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>In an August 30, 1999 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the appellate court certified the case to this Court for review in accordance with Section 13, Rule 124, par. 2 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.<br><br>This Court afforded appellant the opportunity to file an additional brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> in which he assigns the following errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> I.<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT DISCARDING THE PATENTLY INCONSISTENT, NAY CONFLICTING STATEMENTS OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES ANENT THE SUBJECT INCIDENT WHICH WERE TOTALLY IGNORED BY THE TRIAL COURT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>GRANTING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY, NONETHELESS, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF MURDER SINCE THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY IS WANTING, HENCE, THE PENALTY IMPOSED UPON HIM MUST BE ACCORDINGLY REDUCED.<br></blockquote>The resolution of the case hinges on (1) whether the evidence for the prosecution established the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable doubt; and (2) if in the affirmative, whether the proper penalty was correctly modified by the appellate court.<br><br>In affirming the conviction of appellant, the appellate court relied, as did the trial court, mainly on the testimony of Felipe and Benjamin, particularly their positive identification of appellant.<br><br>Appellant bewails, however, the brushing aside of his defense of alibi despite the existence, so he claims, of conflicting statements in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, he highlighting the following instances:&nbsp;

The contradictions, if any, may be explained by the fact that an affidavit can not possibly disclose the details in their entirety, and may inaccurately describe, without deponent detecting it, some of the occurrences narrated.&nbsp; Being taken&nbsp; <i>ex-parte</i>, an affidavit is almost always incomplete and often inaccurate, sometimes from partial suggestions, and sometimes from the want of suggestions and inquiries. It has thus been held that affidavits are generally subordinated in importance to open court declarations because the former are often executed when an affiant's mental faculties are not in such a state as to afford her a fair opportunity of narrating in full the incident which has transpired.&nbsp; Further, affidavits are not complete reproductions of what the declarant has in mind because they are generally prepared by the administering officer and the affiant simply signs them after the same have been read to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></blockquote>As for the other alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, they refer to minor and collateral matters, not to an essential element of the crime,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [70]</sup> and do not have any bearing on the essential fact testified to, that is, the killing of the victim.
