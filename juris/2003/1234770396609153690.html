The special audit team was composed of auditors Victoria C. Quejada and Ruth Paredes. Then President Marcos also created a Special Cabinet Committee composed of the heads of the COA, Ministry of Justice, Office of the Budget and Management, Bureau of Treasury and the National Bureau of Investigation to investigate the fund anomalies in Region VII. This Special Cabinet Committee created a Special Task Force made up of various teams, among others, Team II, headed by Supervising Agent Amado de Coco to cover the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED. The task force worked with the Audit team and retrieved documents and records from the Regional Office and the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED. The Audit team found out that fake LAAs and SACDCs were issued in the year 1977 leading to irregular disbursements of public funds for the payment of "ghost" projects.<br><br>The investigations resulted in the filing of 397 criminal cases with the Sandiganbayan charging certain officials and employees of the government as well as private contractors with violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>In the 198 cases docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 5585-5782, the accused were officials and employees of Central Office of the then Ministry of Public Highways, Manila (MPH for brevity), now Department of Public Works and Highways. They were all acquitted by the Sandiganbayan for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In the 199 cases docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1341, subject-matter of herein petitions, the following officials and employees of the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED were charged: Manuel de Veyra (Regional Director), Rolando Mangubat (Regional Accountant), Delia Preagido (Regional Accountant III), Santos Cabusas (District Property Custodian), Sofronio Mag-uyon (District Accountant), Adventor Fernandez (Highway District Engineer), Jose Genson (Highway District Engineer), Domingo Rayos (Highway District Engineer), Rafael Rabaya, Jr. (Assistant Highway District Engineer), Godofredo Lagura (Assistant Highway District Engineer), Nestor Rabaya (Material Testing Engineer), Oscar Belcina, Sr. (Civil Engineer), Rogelio Alvizo, (Civil Engineer), Florito Montecillo (Supervising Civil Engineer I), Catalino Magno, Jr. (Supervising Civil Engineer), Perseverando Licen (Civil Engineer), Pompeo Almagro, (Civil Engineer), Efren Coyoca (Auditor), Harvey Ruiz (Auditor), Edgar Osmeña (Auditor), Fe delos Reyes (Auditing Examiner), Guilberto Hermosa, Aniceto Arriola and Graciano Navales, Jr. (COA Auditing Aides); together with private contractors/suppliers Rufino Nuñez, Antolin Jariol, Erasmo Gabison, Feliciano Echavez, Joselito Genson and Pablo Guinocor.<br><br>The 199 Informations are identically worded, except as to names of the persons charged, dates of the commission, amounts defrauded, and supplies/materials involved. We adopt the same format used by the Sandiganbayan in its decision by reproducing only the Information filed in Criminal Case No. 1143, leaving blank and unfilled the proper spaces corresponding to the above-mentioned particulars, thus:<br><blockquote>That in, about and during the period from [period specified]<sup> </sup>in the City and Province of Cebu, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable SANDIGANBAYAN, the accused [name]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> all public officers and employees in the Ministry of Public Highways and Commission on Audit, Republic of the Philippines, conspiring, confederating, conniving and cooperating with each other, and conspiracy, confederation, connivance and cooperation with [name]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> a private contractor for the supply of materials, with manifest partiality, evident bad faith and/or inexcusable negligence in the discharge and performance of their official and administrative functions, did then and there unlawfully and feloniously cause undue injury, loss and prejudice to the Government of the Philippines by causing, allowing, approving and receiving the illegal and unauthorized disbursement and expenditure of public funds, out of the National Treasury, in the amount of x x x x x Philippine Currency, thru General Voucher No. x x x x x<sup> </sup>and charged against spurious and fake `Letter of Advice of Allotment' (LAA) and fake `Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceiling' (ACDC); supported by simulated and falsified public bidding proposals, abstract of sealed quotations, Requisitions, Purchase Order, Delivery Receipts, Inspection of Reports and Tally Sheets thus making it appear (1) that said expenditures and disbursements were legally funded out of authorized budgetary appropriations of the Ministry of Public Highways; (2) that the accounting and auditing rules and requirements on public biddings in relation to government purchases of equipment supplies and materials were complied with; (3) that a valid purchase order was prepared and approved; and (4) that ...worth ... were needed, ordered, delivered, receipted, inspected and consequently, paid for - when in truth and in fact, as all the aforementioned accused very well knew, that such were all false and falsified as same were prepared to merely give semblances of regularity of the transactions and as designed means to pursue and cover-up the fraud; and finally, upon receipt of the aforesaid amount the accused misappropriated, converted and misapplied the same for their own personal benefit, uses and gain thus, causing injury to the government in the aforesaid amount of ...<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>The following tabulation specifies the data corresponding to the particulars alleged in each of the Information under which the petitioners are charged:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="15%"><div align="center">Crim.

In turn, the MPH issues a Sub-Advice of Allotment (SAA) and the corresponding Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (ACDC) addressed to the Regional Director concerned which are duly recorded in the appropriate book of account of the Central Office of the MPH. These SAAs and ACDCs serve as the authority for the Regional Offices to obligate and disburse funds which become the sources of funds of the various Engineering Districts apportioned throughout each region. The Engineering District then submits a Program of Work to the Regional Director for the release of these funds. Upon approval of said request by the Regional Director, the Regional Finance Officer issues a Letter of Advice of Allotment (LAA) and the corresponding Sub-Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (SACDC), as authority to incur obligation and to disburse the funds so obligated, to the District Engineer. The LAA and the SACDC are then duly recorded in the logbook of the Regional Office and are sent to the district engineer's office.<br><br>The testimony of Auditor Paredes as to the implementation of the project in the district level is summarized by the Sandiganbayan as follows:<br><blockquote>Implementation of the district's programs of work now go into the requisition stage, wherein the proper Requisition for Supplies and Equipment (RSE), needed for the prosecution of its projects and embodied in the approved program of work, is prepared by the requisitioning officer, certified as to the availability of funds by the District Accountant, and approved by the District Engineer. The Project Engineer also prepares a Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) which the Accountant certifies as to availability of funds. The RSE, together with a copy of the program of work, is then transmitted to the Regional Office for the approval of the Regional Director and thereafter returned to the district concerned for prosecution of the project after compliance with bidding and award procedures.<br><br>Based on the approved RSE, the district's Property Custodian or Purchasing/Supply Officer, with the approval of the District Engineer, sends out Request for Sealed Quotations to various contractors or suppliers requesting them to submit, on or before a date fixed therein, their quotations for the materials or supplies. Notices thereof are likewise publicized through either newspaper publications or postings in public places. Within the reglementary period, the sealed bid forms are opened by the Committee on Bidding and Award in the presence of representatives of the District Engineer and the District/City Auditor. The lowest price quotation or bid is determined and the corresponding Abstract of Bids is prepared and signed by the members of the committee, as well as the auditor's and district engineer's representatives, after which the corresponding award is made to the said lowest bidder, duly approved by the District Engineer. A Purchase Order (PO) is thereafter prepared by the Property Custodian, addressed to the winning bidder, certified as to availability of funds by the Accountant and approved by the District Engineer.<br><br>Delivery is then effected by the winning bidder, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PO, which may include the time required to start and terminate said deliveries and the places of delivery. Inspection of deliveries are made at the delivery or project sites by a representative of the Auditor's office upon receipt of a verbal or written request for such inspection prepared by the Property Custodian to the Auditor. The Auditor's representative inspects the deliveries, signs the Delivery Receipts (DRs) and, finally, the Report of Inspection (ROI), duly concurred in by the Property Custodian. During said deliveries, samples of the materials are also tested for their conformity with specifications and the results of such tests are submitted to the District Engineer to be attached to the payment vouchers, together with all other supporting documents.<br><br>After completion of deliveries, the corresponding General Voucher (GV) for the payment of the supplies or materials delivered is prepared, usually by someone at the district office. Said GV contains on the face thereof five (5) certifications to be signed by the proper officials, namely, the Property Custodian, the Project Engineer, the District or City Engineer, the Accountant and the District or City Auditor attesting and certifying to the correctness, legality and propriety of the transactions covered by said GV. Attached to said GV and required to be examined and verified by the proper district officials and their subordinates are the requisite supporting documents, such as, the RSE, ROA, Program of Work, Detailed Estimates, Request for Sealed Quotations, Abstract of Bids, PO, DRs, Request for Inspection, Test Reports and Tax Clearance Certificate of the supplier-contractor. After the GV is processed, pre-audited and approved, the papers are brought to the Cashier for the preparation of the check or treasury warrant or TCAA check, which is also pre-audited. The check is then released to the supplier-contractor or his duly authorized representative who issues the corresponding official receipt.<br><br>At the end of each calendar month, the District Accountant prepares several reports, including the Report of Obligations Incurred (ROI) and the Report of Checks Issued (RCI), which are submitted to the Regional Office. At the Regional Budget and Finance Division, these reports, together with those coming from other districts, are entered in the proper journals and, in the course of ordinary accounting procedures, are entered in the General Ledger. In turn, the entries in the General Ledger become the basis for monthly Trial Balances (TBs) which are prepared cumulatively by the Regional Accountant, recommended for approval by the Regional Finance officer and approved by the Regional Director, which TBs are also submitted every month to the Central Office of the MPH. At the end of the fiscal calendar year, the final Trial Balance is prepared by the Regional Office and likewise submitted to the MPH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>Paredes further testified: Her team prepared a working paper containing the summary of Sub-Advice of Allotments (SAAs) received by Region VII from the MPH, Central Office in 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The summary was based on the (1) certifications from the Regional officials<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (2) the copies of the SAAs themselves and (3) the logbook of the Regional Offices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They prepared another working paper to match the SAAs and the Letters of Advice of Allotments (LAAs) released by the Region to Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED for 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> While they found some LAAs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> that matched with the SAAs and these LAAs were entered in the logbook of the Regional Office, they also found another set of LAAs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which were fake or irregular as they were (1) not stamped released by the accounting section of the region at the topmost portion of the sheet, (2) undated and not numbered consecutively, (3) not recorded in the Regional Office logbook, (4) not covered by any appropriation law and (5) not supported by SAA number coming from the MPH which must be reflected in the LAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It was possible to release several LAAs but not exceeding the amount of the SAA and she found no fake SAAs released by the MPH, Central Office.

Accused District Engineer Jose Genson, Assistant District Engineers Rafael Rabaya, Jr. and Godofredo Lagura and District Accountant Sofronio Mag-uyon likewise acted with evident bad faith, gross inexcusable negligence and manifest partiality in receiving and implementing the fake LAAs and SACDCs since they should have known and noticed that all the allotments released thereunder were not for `regular maintenance', especially so when the district had been receiving its regular maintenance allocations for 1977; that they had not requested formally for such extra allocations; that the LAAs and SACDCs were fake or spurious on their faces and signed by unauthorized officials, and that they had not prepared any program of work to justify such extra allocations.<br><br>All the other accused officials from the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED, namely, Santos Cabusas, Nestor Rabaya, Almagro, Montecillo, Alvizo, Magno, Jr., Belciña and Licen who are all engineers, together with those involved in auditing functions, namely, District Auditors Harvey Ruiz, Edgar Osmeña and Efren Coyoca, and Auditing Aides Aniceto Arriola and Guilberto Hermosa, likewise acted with evident bad faith and manifest partiality in participating in the preparation, processing and approval of the GVs and supporting documents, such as RSEs, Requests for Obligation of Allotment (ROAs), Abstracts of Bids, POs, Delivery Receipts (DRs), Summary of Deliveries, Reports of Inspection (ROIs) and Checks in payment of `ghost projects' to fake or spurious contractors-suppliers, among whom are Jariol and Joselito Genson. They not only connived and confederated in the hasty and mass production of such ante-dated documents, excluding programs of work, but also allowed their names, positions and signatures to be used in completing the cycle which would lend a semblance of legality or regularity to the questioned transactions and illegal disbursements and which caused undue injury to the Government in the total amount of P7,005,477.22. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that their claims and pretensions as to their lack of expertise or means to determine the validity or nullity of the LAAs and SACDCs in questions have any bases, however, they are still liable for having acted with gross inexcusable negligence in the performance of their respective duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote>Except for Manuel de Veyra, who was acquitted, all the other accused in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1341, which include herein petitioners, were convicted in all the criminal cases they were respectively charged.

She testified that on the two separate days that she went to the job sites where the deliveries were to have been made, she found none; that she called the attention of the Auditor, petitioner Efren Coyoca regarding the non-delivery but he told her to sign the tally sheets and inspection reports even without actual deliveries and assured her that he will be responsible if something went wrong. She did not go to the jobsite after her first and second inspections because petitioner Auditor Coyoca told her to just sign the tally sheets and there was no need to go to the site since there would be no delivery at all. Petitioner Auditor Coyoca was replaced by petitioner Auditor Edgar Osmeña and later by petitioner Auditor Harvey Ruiz. Delos Reyes brought the matter of non-delivery to the attention of these replacement Auditors who just told her to continue with what had been the practice.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan found no actual deliveries of materials and aptly made the following disquisition:<br><blockquote>With respect to the issue as to whether there was actual compliance and deliveries made by the accused-contractors herein, the Court must necessarily adjudge that there was no such compliance or deliveries and that the execution and preparation of the supposed DRs, Summaries of Deliveries (Tally Sheets), and Reports of Inspection, together with the Reports of Analysis of the materials, were all manufactured en masse and ante-dated to give some semblance of justification for the questioned transactions. Even if it will be admitted, for the sake of argument, that there were projects during 1977 within the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED involving re-gravelling and asphalting and that there were deliveries made on such projects, the Court concludes that these were in connection with the `regular maintenance' projects and not, as claimed by the defense, part of `routine, periodic, or progressive maintenance' or for `rehabilitation, betterment or improvement.' Considering the allotments released to the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED for regular maintenance in 1977, and there being no showing at all that dire calamities, such as typhoons and earthquakes, had occurred over Cebu province during said year which would have necessitated or required additional allotments, then the defense theory to that effect must be rejected. Such a theory appears to be a desperate and last minute concoction by the accused which they seek to impose on the Court in the total absence of any meritorious or valid defense.<br><br>This Court's credulity and powers of imagination would have to be stretched ten-fold to conceive that the seven (7) accused-contractors could make the deliveries alleged by them within the limited periods appearing in the supporting papers to the GVs in question, notably, the DRs and the Tally Sheets. The convergence of the dates when some of these deliveries were alleged to have been made and the monumental, if not stupendous, efforts required to perform such tasks, together with the inordinate haste with which the alleged inspections were made, resulting in similarly hasty payments, all these circumstances indicate that no such deliveries were actually made. In fact, the defense theories put up by the accused who are officials of the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED suffer from an intrinsic flaw or defect, which is, that two of the seven (7) contractors suppliers had admitted non deliveries by pleading guilty in the cases wherein they were charged. As reflected in the record, accused Gabison and Echavez had withdrawn their previous pleas of `not guilty' in all of cases wherein they were charged and, upon re-arraignment, pleaded guilty, thus, admitting that they had participated in the conspiracy by submitting simulated bids, making fictitious deliveries and receiving payments for them. Accused Pablo Guinocor, on the other hand, has remained at- large up to this date while Rufino Nunez had died after having been convicted by final judgment in the Danao '78 and Lapu Lapu '78 cases wherein he was also similarly charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>...<br><br>Furthermore, even assuming, arguendo, that actual projects were being prosecuted by the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED during the period from January to December, 1977 and that there were actual deliveries of Items 200 and asphalt made on such projects, the Court logically assumes that these were in connection with "regular maintenance" and not for "periodic maintenance", or for "rehabilitation, betterment or improvement" (RBI) as claimed by the defense. Considering that, as previously stated, the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED had already been issued regular LAAs and SACDCs in the amounts of P5,737,197.97 and P6,529,063.39 respectively, for the entire year 1977, and there is no showing whatsoever, that, firstly, such allocations were insufficient; secondly, that extreme emergencies, calamities or "force majeure" had actually occurred during said year to justify additional allocations and, thirdly, that the proper request or requests had been made to the Central Office, MPH, through the Regional Office, then the inevitable conclusions which arise are that the alleged "periodic maintenance" or "RBI" were not actually done but had been prosecuted as part and parcel of "regular maintenance" and that such theory had been concocted by the defense to justify the illegal disbursements made through the 199 GVs. For it defies logic and reason to accept the defense posture that illegally-disbursed and misappropriated public funds would be actually spent for any project at all. Instead, the co-conspirators would naturally divide the spoils among themselves rather than look for ways and means to disburse them pursuant to the generally-accepted accounting and auditing procedures. Such a situation we find to be completely in accord with the facts and circumstances appearing on the record.<br><br>Moreover, attempts by the defense to discredit the testimony of discharged state witness Fe delos Reyes to the effect that, as Auditing Aide or Examiner, she signed Daily Tally Sheets and Reports of Inspections for supplies and materials supposedly delivered at the project sites by accused-contractors when there were actually no deliveries or inspection, do not gain our acceptance or approval. Aside from the fact that delos Reyes' testimony appears to be convincing and credible, the facts testified to by her have been substantiated and/or corroborated by the pleas of `guilty' of accused-contractors Gabison and Echavez. If such modus operandi was resorted to with respect to these two contractors, then there is no reason for its non-application or non-compliance as regards accused-contractors Joselito Genson and Jariol, Jr. and also Nunez, Guinocor and Abatayo. Again, logic and common sense dictates that the disbursement of public funds emanating from the fake or irregular LAAs and SACDCs and the utilization of simulated RSEs, POs, Tests Reports, DRs, DTSs, ROIs and GVs would not include or cover the actual deliveries of supplies and materials since the co-conspirators would not be able to profit therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>...<br><br>Thus, if We are to believe and accept the accused-contractors' theories, more particularly those of accused Jariol and Joselito Genson, with respect to their alleged prosecution of projects in 1977 within the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED, involving P7,005,477.22, We can just imagine the monstrous traffic jams and problems which would have occurred within the district throughout the year, considering that, at the same time and during the same months, projects involving regular maintenance worth P5,735,197.97 were on-going. Considering further, that during the same year, contractors Rufino Nunez, Juliana delos Angeles, Antolin Jariol and Erasmo Gabison were involved in allegedly similar projects in the Cebu 1<sup>st</sup> HED, Mandaue City HED, Davao City HED and Lapu-Lapu City HED, then it could be logically and reasonably concluded that they would have run short of supplies and equipment, such as trucks, payloaders, bulldozers and rollers, as well as manpower. Furthermore, no attempt whatsoever had been made by the accused district officials and the accused-contractors to show or prove that there was no overlapping or regular maintenance projects with the projects in question, there being no showing that the district's records for 1977 are not available or complete.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><b></b></blockquote>The general vouchers were prepared for payment to the contractors/ suppliers concerned, one of whom was petitioner Joselito Genson.

The general vouchers contain on the face thereof five certifications signed by the proper officials, to wit: (1) a certification of receipt of supplies accomplished by the Property Custodian; (2) a certification of correctness, that is, that the expenses are necessary and lawful and that the prices are just and reasonable and not in excess of current rates in the locality accomplished by the Project Engineeer; (3) approval by the District Engineer; (4) a certification accomplished by the Accountant, that the GV had been properly approved, its account codes proper, and that it is supported by the proper documents; (5) a certification that the GV has undergone pre-audit accomplished by the Auditor.<br><br>The general vouchers and the supporting documents attached thereto were processed, pre-audited and approved for payment by the District Auditor, petitioners Efren Coyoca or Edgar Osmeña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>The Sandiganbayan found that there were patent splitting of payments in the general vouchers as shown by the supporting documents which was in violation of COA Circular No.76-41. One glaring fact which cannot be overlooked is that all the 199 general vouchers were for amounts less than P50,000.00 even if most of these vouchers were supported by the same set of documents worth much higher than the said amount. Under COA Circular No. 76-41, the District Auditor can approve vouchers in amounts not exceeding P50,000.00. All the general vouchers more than P50,000.00 must have to be pre-audited and approved for payment by the Regional Auditor instead of the herein petitioner District Auditors. In fact, COA Examiner Ruth Paredes testified that during their investigation, they found out that the Regional Auditor who routinely receives copy of the LAAs and SACDCs from the Regional Office, was not furnished copies of the fake LAAs. Paredes explained that this was due to the fact that the Regional Auditor who received copies of the SAA released by the Central Office to the Regional Office would disapprove the voucher since he could easily see that the fake LAAs were beyond the SAA issued.<br><br>With the approval of the general vouchers, checks were prepared by the Cashier and released to the supplier/contractor or his representative who then issued the corresponding official receipts.

The individual acts of the petitioners including petitioner contractor Genson pointed to a single criminal intent, one performing one part of the transaction and the others another part of the same transaction, so as to complete it with a view to attaining the object which they were pursuing, i.e., to defraud the government.<br><br>We will now discuss the respective liabilities of the petitioners.<br><br><b>Petitioners Assistant District Engineer Rafael Rabaya, Jr., Engineer Nestor Rabaya, Material Testing Supervisor, Project Engineers Rogelio Alvizo, Pompeyo Almagro and Catalino Magno, Jr. </b>were convicted for signing the RIVs, worksheet for mechanical analysis and tally sheets.

The general vouchers were traced to the fake LAAs. Petitioners made it appear that there were valid requisitions and deliveries of materials, that projects were indeed undertaken. However, the Sandiganbayan found that although there were deliveries in 1977 in Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED, these deliveries were in connection with the regular maintenance projects covered by the regular LAAs and SACDCs and not part of the routine, periodic or progressive maintenance as claimed by the petitioners which were based on the fake LAAs and SACDCs; and that no deliveries were made under the fake LAAs and SACDCs since payments to the vouchers went to the pockets of the co-conspirators.<br><br>Liability of Asst. District Engineer Rafael Rabaya, Jr.:<br><br>Rafael was the then Assistant District Engineer of the Cebu 2<sup>nd </sup>HED. He was second in command in the over-all supervision of the district office which includes the proper implementation of the maintenance, construction and improvement of the district's national roads and bridges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> It was established and unrebutted that the district had received 33 regular LAAs in 1977 for the regular maintenance of the district's national roads and bridges. It was also shown that when the district would ask for supplementary allocations outside of the regular allocations given, a written communication must be made by the District Engineer to the Regional Director who would refer the request and the copy of the program of work attached thereto to the Central Office for approval. Petitioner Rafael, in his petition, insists that requests for additional allotments which covered the alleged ghost projects were indeed made but these requests and the programs of work were all taken by the NBI agents when the latter retrieved documents from the district office. If these documents really existed, petitioner Rafael could have easily secured a certification from the Regional Office where the requests were made or from the Central Office where the alleged written requests and programs of work were supposed to have been forwarded to prove his claim. It is an essential part of standard operating procedure that these documents have copies for each office where they customarily pass through. Without such written request accompanied by a program of work, the district had no basis for additional releases of funds.<br><br>Petitioner Rafael had signed so many RIVs as the requisitioning officer and a painstaking review of these RIVs showed that even if the projects undertaken refer to the same road for the same materials and for almost the same period of time, there were splitting of RIVs which resulted in separate biddings for each RIV and separate purchase orders. We find no compelling reason to disregard the finding of the Sandiganbayan that such splitting had been deliberately resorted to in order to avoid said transactions to be sent to the higher authorities for approval.<br><br>Petitioner Rafael was also held liable for affixing his signature in the general vouchers certifying that the expenses are necessary, lawful and incurred for.

Moreover, his defense of denial does not relieve him from the fact that had he exercised due diligence, he would have known the badges of fraud enumerated by the Sandiganbayan in its decision and refused to be a part of the conspiracy.<br><br>We therefore sustain the conviction of petitioner Rafael Rabaya, Jr. in 184 counts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>Rafael was not charged in Criminal Case No. 1232 but the Sandiganbayan convicted him in said case.

The evidence of the prosecution clearly show that no deliveries were actually made, thus, Nestor is guilty of affixing his signature in the worksheets for mechanical analysis when in fact there were no deliveries and no analysis were made by him.

The prosecution had sufficiently established the falsity of the same. All the LAAs which were regularly issued by the Regional Office were recorded in their logbook. The fact that the fake LAAs were not recorded conclusively established their falsity.<br><br>Petitioners Rabayas further contend that although the total amount released to Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED for 1977 through the 33 LAAs was P5,735,197.97, only the amount of P1,919,385.71 was actually released for the regular maintenance of the national roads and bridges which amount was inadequate to meet the total effective maintenance kilometrage (EMK) of 294.54 a year.<br><br>We find the argument devoid of merit.<br><br>The 33 regular LAAs issued to Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED provided also for calamity funds for the repair of the national and barangay roads hit by typhoons. There were also funds released for the construction, rehabilitation, betterment and improvement of the other national and barangay roads. These funds were released together with the amount of P1,919,385.71 for the regular maintenance of the national roads and bridges; thus, the claim of petitioners Rabayas is misleading. Assuming arguendo that the funds released were inadequate to maintain the national roads, such deficiency, in the absence of a written request for additional allotment did not give authority to petitioners to obtain the release of these funds in violation of the standard operating procedure. To reiterate, the LAAs are issued by the Regional Office based on the SAA from the MPH. The fake LAAs did not have the SAA No. from which the allotment was based and were not recorded in the logbook of the Regional Office.<br><br>The contention of petitioners Rabayas that the court erred in giving evidentiary value to the pleas of guilty of accused Mangubat, Gabison and Echavez as it violated the hearsay and res inter alios acta rule, is devoid of merit.<br><br>The Solicitor General, in the Brief for respondent State, aptly refuted the argument of petitioners, as follows:<br><blockquote>In their fourth and last argument, petitioners maintain that the Sandiganbayan erred in giving evidentiary value to the pleas of guilty of Mangubat, Gabison and Echavez, petitioners' co-accused. According to petitioners, the admission or confession of a party may be presented as evidence only against himself pursuant to Sec. 33 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court and under Sec. 26 of the same Rule; that, therefore, admission of the pleas of guilty of Mangubat, Gabison and Echavez against petitioners violated the hearsay and res inter alios acta rules.<br><br>Sections 26 and 33 of the Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, cited by petitioners, provide as follows:<br><blockquote>Section 26. Admissions of a party. - The act, declaration or omission of a party as to relevant fact may be given in evidence against him.<br><br>Section 33. Confession. - The declaration of an accused [expressly] acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, OR OF ANY OFFENSE NECESSARILY INCLUDED THEREIN, may be given in evidence against him.</blockquote>On the other hand, the rule of res inter alios acta, mentioned by petitioners, is embodied in Section 28 of Rule 130, Rules of Court states:<br><blockquote>Section 28. Admission by third party. - The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another and proceedings against one cannot affect another, except as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>However, this aforecited rule allow exceptions one of these being Section 30 on admissions by a co-conspirator, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 30. Admission by conspirator. - The act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its existence, may be given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration.</blockquote>Petitioners contend that the Sandiganbayan violated the rule of res inter alios acta when said Court made reference to the pleas of guilty of Mangubat, Gabison and Echavez. It is submitted that this contention is untenable.<br><br>Gabison, Mangubat and Echavez were charged together with petitioners for having acted in conspiracy with one another to commit the offenses. The pleas of guilty of some of the accused are admissions of the truth of the accusations that they committed acts of falsifications done during the existence of the conspiracy.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan merely declared that the pleas of guilty confirmed the issuance and release of fake or simulated LAAs and SACDCs, the irregular, improper and illegal preparation, execution and processing of the general vouchers and their supporting documents, and the non-delivery of materials and non-prosecution of ghost projects. In short, the pleas of guilty were merely confirmatory: they confirmed the facts already established by other evidence of the prosecution. <b>Said pleas were not used by the Sandiganbayan to convict petitioners for, as already mentioned, even if the pleas were completely disregarded, the prosecution had already succeeded in proving petitioners' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</b><br><br>It could be conceded, as petitioners assert, that the confession, i.e., the pleas of guilty, were not made during the existence of the conspiracy (Rules of Court, Rule 130, Sec. 30). However, it is submitted that said pleas are nonetheless admissible against petitioners as co-conspirators because the pleas were made in open court. In other words, they are judicial confessions. <b>The rule embodied in Sec. 30 that the declaration of a conspirator made after the termination of the conspiracy is inadmissible against his co-conspirator applies only to an extra-judicial confession, and not to a plea of guilty, which is a judicial confession. In this very specific instance, the rule of res inter alios acta does not apply because the confessions embodied in the pleas of guilty are judicial confessions, not extra-judicial ones.</b><br><br>...<br><br>The hearsay rule being put up by petitioners apply only if Gabison, Mangubat and Echavez' admission of guilt was testified to by another person or by means of affidavit. In this case the three co-accused personally confessed their guilt during arraignment where petitioners were likewise present. If petitioners wanted to dispute the circumstances surrounding the confession of guilt of Gabison, Mangubat and Echavez, petitioners had the right to present the three as hostile witnesses during the trial or petitioners could even have presented the three as their own witnesses. And this fault should not be translated in terms of absence of opportunity to cross-examine the three.<br><br>Petitioners invoke the rule on res inter alios acta alleging that the pleas of guilty of the three should have not been given weight because they were made after the conspiracy had terminated (Petition, p. 29). This is erroneous because the Sandiganbayan did not convict petitioners on the basis of the pleas of guilty. The Sandiganbayan merely said that the prosecution's case had been amply supported and strengthened by the pleas of guilty entered by the three. The pleas of guilty are in themselves evidence that the pleaders committed the acts mentioned in the Informations. The pleas certainly have corroborative effect on the evidence-in-chief of the prosecution. There is no rule violated by the Sandiganbayan when it considered the pleas of guilty.<br><br>The motive of the three in pleading not guilty is both speculative and insignificant. Petitioners could imagine the motives of the three for pleading guilty, but the fact remains that the consequence of their pleas is that they admitted the commission of the crimes charged. Petitioners cannot escape the effects of this admission.<br><br><b>Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the portion of the Decision referring to the pleas of guilty of Gabison, Mangubat and Echavez is not the basis for the conviction of petitioners. Even if said portion is disregarded, the decision is still supported by evidence which proved petitioners' guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, even if there were no pleas of guilty by Mangubat, Gabison and Echavez, the prosecution was able to prove petitioners' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</b><br><br>Assuming that it was error for the Sandiganbayan to consider and refer to the pleas of guilty, this is not reversible error because after disregarding the pleas of guilty there remains sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of petitioners beyond reasonable doubt, and the substantial rights of petitioners were not, therefore, prejudice by its admission (See U.S. vs. Empeinado, 9 Phil. 613, 616 [1908]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>We uphold the conviction of petitioner Nestor Rabaya in 184 counts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>Liabilities of Project Engineers Rogelio Alvizo, Catalino Magno, Jr. and Pompeyo Almagro:<br><br>Project Engineers Alvizo, Almagro and Magno, Jr. claim that they received the materials delivered in their respective projects; that they signed the tally sheets certifying receipt of materials after they had checked and verified the deliveries; that all projects assigned to them were prosecuted in accordance with the program of work.

The appropriation law which authorized such expenditure was indicated in the regular LAAs but it was not so indicated in the fake LAAs.<br><br>All regular LAAs were dated while five fake LAAs were undated. COA Auditor Paredes explained during her cross-examination that the LAA must be dated because under budgetary regulations, the funds intended for a particular quarter becomes self-executory only at the beginning of that quarter; and that the LAA has to be dated to indicate when it is supposed to take effect because obligation which may not be incurred in the particular quarter is chargeable against the allotments of subsequent quarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Thus, in the absence of the date in the fake LAA, Mag-uyon would not know when it is to take effect and to what period of obligation it should be applied.<br><br>These were patent irregularities on the faces of the LAAs which Mag-uyon could not have failed to see but still, he affixed his signature on the RIV and ROA certifying to the availability of funds.<br><br>Notably, petitioner Mag-uyon had approved 199 general vouchers which were all for amounts less than P50,000.00.

It has been established that there was conspiracy among the district and regional officials and employees thus, Mag-uyon had to record all the transactions done in the district to enable his co-conspirators in the region, who received the cost ledger sheet, to manipulate the books of accounts.

His signature in the 199 general vouchers certifying that he received the supplies and materials served as a vital link to perpetuate such anomaly. As Property Custodian, he discharges a very sensitive function in the work of the Ministry of Public Highways, even in such areas that may be said to be routine. It is of no defense therefore to say that since there were engineers to inspect and supervise the projects as well as the materials requisitioned therefore, he need not have intervened therein.

A higher amount of the vouchers would have required the vouchers to be forwarded to the Regional Auditor for action and review. The Sandiganbayan described the details of splitting, thus:<br><blockquote>V.

Otherwise, if such transactions were to be reviewed and pre-audited by the Regional COA Auditor, who might be adverse to joining the conspiracy then the GVs and supporting papers may be found to be the result of (1) inexistent or ante-dated programs of work, (2) illegal funding, (3) irregular bidding, (4) fictitious or simulated deliveries and inspection, and other anomalies. Consequently, the Court considers such `splitting' as an integral and/or essential element or link in the conspiracy to defraud the Government inasmuch as such practice was consciously and deliberately resorted to in order to hide the massive misappropriation being undertaken by some of the accused herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup></blockquote>The participation of petitioners Coyoca and Osmeña in the conspiracy were established by the testimony of prosecution witness Fe delos Reyes who positively identified them, to wit:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q -</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Now in the early part of 1977 would you recall if the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> Highway Engineering District have ever undertaken projects concerning the maintenance or repair of the highway under its jurisdiction?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td>Now, why do you know this fact?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>Because, I was assigned as one of the property inspectors during that time.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td><div align="justify">As property inspector, what do you usually perform with respect to these projects being undertaken or prosecuted by the district?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>I usually perform the inspection.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td>Inspection of?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>Of deliveries of supplies and materials.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td>And where do you usually make the inspection of these materials that would be delivered?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>At the job site.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td>When you said `at the job site', to what place are you particularly referring to?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>It depends upon my office memorandum issued by the auditor.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td>Now, usually who assigns you to inspect deliveries of materials for projects being undertaken by the district?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td>It is the auditor.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q -</td><td>And how are you assigned -

positive declaration of prosecution witness Fe de Los Reyes was corroborated by the voluminous documentary evidence consisting of the 199 general vouchers and checks as well as the supporting documents attached thereto which were submitted by the prosecution establishing the complicity of petitioners in the illegality of the subject transactions.<br><br>A careful review of the 199 general vouchers and the supporting documents revealed that there were splitting of requisitions, purchase orders and general vouchers which were all in violation of COA Circular No. 76-41, dated 30 July 1976. As defined by the Circular, "splitting" in its literal sense, means dividing or breaking up into separate parts or portions, or an act resulting in a fissure, rupture, breach. Within the sphere of government procurement, splitting is associated with requisitions, purchase orders, deliveries and payments.<br><br>Splitting may be in the form of (1) Splitting of Requisitions which consists in the non-consolidation of requisitions for one or more items needed at or about the same time by the requisitioner; (2) Splitting of Purchase Orders which consists in the issuance of two or more purchase orders based on two or more requisitions for the same or at about the same time by the different requisitioners; and (3) Splitting of payments which consists in making two or more payments for one or more items involving one purchase order. These forms of splitting are resorted to in order to avoid (a) inspection of deliveries, (b) action, review of approval by higher authorities; (or) public bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> We find that all these forms of splitting were used in all the transactions brought to the attention of the auditors. Thus, even if the projects undertaken refer to the same road and for the same materials and for almost the same period of time, separate requisitions were prepared and separate purchase orders were made corresponding to each requisition. Also, payments were split into amounts less than P50,000.00 although the general vouchers were supported by the same RIVs and POs. All, to avoid action or review by the higher authorities.<br><br>The petitioners District Auditors were tasked to safeguard expenditures and uses of government funds hence they had to be on the look-out for cases of splitting in varied forms. The job of an auditor is to pre-audit the general voucher and review the documents attached thereto before a check is to be issued. Petitioners auditors could not have failed to notice that the 199 general vouchers were all for amounts less than P50,000.00 despite the fact that most of these vouchers were supported by the same set of documents, i.e., RIVs and POs, which were worth higher than such amount. To reiterate, several of the general vouchers were made in payment for the same kind of materials to be delivered to the same project for almost the same period of time and payable to the same contractor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> Notably, some of the checks issued pursuant to these general vouchers bore the same date<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> or were dated very close to each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br>All the herein petitioners insist that there were no splitting of payments but only partial payments in accordance with the progress of work. They claim that partial payments are allowed under existing rules of the MPH particularly Art. 9.06 of the Standard Specification for Highways and Bridges which reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 9.06. PARTIAL PAYMENTS. Once each month, or oftener if warranted, as the work progresses, the Engineer and the representative of the Contractor will make an estimate of the value of the work performed and materials complete in place in accordance with the contract. Materials on hand but not complete in place shall not be included for payment.<br><br>Each consecutive estimate shall be filed by the Contractor as a claim against the government and certified to by the Engineer. Ten per cent of each estimate shall be deducted and retained until final acceptance of the entire contract as guarantee for good performance. The monthly payments shall be considered as approximate only and shall not be evidence of acceptance of unsatisfactory work or material. The retention of ten per cent on every partial payment shall be made regardless of whether or not claims for labor and materials have been paid, and shall not be released or authorized to be paid to the contractor until after sixty calendar days have elapsed, counting from the date the final payment on the contract is made.</blockquote>We are not convinced. Petitioners' reliance on Art. 9.06 is misplaced for the following reasons: <i>Firstly</i>, the RIVs pertained to the procurement of supplies and materials and the purchase orders covering these procurements did not indicate therein any partial payment that may be allowed to the contractor. Hence, the suppliers were obligated to deliver the materials within the period agreed upon and to be paid only after completion of the delivery. <i>Secondly</i>, based on the delivery receipts and checks paid to the suppliers, the alleged deliveries of materials were completed within 10-15 days from the start of the deliveries and paid within 3-4 weeks from the issuance of the RIVs. A reading of Art. 9.06 would show that the allowed partial payments refer to long term project which is precisely why the frequency of the said payments is generally on a monthly basis. <i>Thirdly</i>, the almost one hundred checks issued to the suppliers which were based on the general vouchers supported by the same RIVs and purchase orders were dated on the same date or were dated very close to each other; therefore, partial payments did not serve its alleged purpose of helping the suppliers to defray their expenses. It bears stressing that when these contractors/ suppliers participated and were awarded the whole quantity of what they bidded, they were expected that they had their own resources to comply in order to attain uniformity of the materials delivered. <i>Finally</i>, it is incredibly astonishing that all the alleged partial payments were uniformly pegged at amounts below P50,000.00 when this circumstance only shows that the scheme was deliberately employed by petitioners to make sure that said payments would no longer be made subject to the approval of the Regional Auditor.<br><br>Thus, we agree with the Sandiganbayan that the prosecution has amply established the guilt of petitioners Auditors Coyoca and Osmeña, as well as the Auditing Aides Hermosa and Arriola.<br><br>Records disclose that although petitioner Osmeña was convicted in Criminal Case No. 1163, he was not charged in said case; and in Criminal Case No. 1232, he was neither convicted nor acquitted by the Sandiganbayan although he had been duly charged and tried in said case. The assailed decision must be set aside insofar as Osmeña is concerned in Criminal Case No. 1163 and the records should be remanded to Sandiganbayan for proper disposition of Criminal Case No. 1232.<br><br>Petitioner Coyoca was charged in Criminal Case No. 1289 and tried but was neither convicted nor acquitted by the Sandiganbayan. Consequently, records of said case must be remanded to respondent court for proper disposition.<br><br>While there are cases where heads of offices, whose actions involved the very function he had to discharge, cannot be swept into a conspiracy conviction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> we find the same to be inapplicable in the present cases before the Court. Herein petitioners, Engineer Rafael Rabaya, Jr., District Accountant Mag-uyon, Property Custodian Cabusas and the District Auditors who were heads of their respective divisions in the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED were knowing participants in the conspiracy considering that despite the patent irregularities in the documents presented to them, they still affixed their signatures thereto. In fine, all the individual acts of petitioners were so synchronized and concerted leaving no room for any doubt that there was conspiracy and connivance among them.<br><br><b>Liability of petitioner contractor Joselito Genson:</b><br><br>Petitioner Genson was one of the private contractors who was convicted of 19 counts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> of violation of section 3(e), RA 3019 for having conspired, cooperated and confederated with the other petitioners in a fraudulent scheme that defrauded the government.<br><br>Genson was not charged in Criminal Case No. 1232 but he was convicted. The Solicitor General, in his Comment, points out that Genson was not charged in Criminal Case No. 1251 as the name of contractor Rufino Nuñez appeared in the body of the Information. A reading of the Information would show that Genson's name appeared in the title as well as in the first paragraph of the Information but not in the body of the Information. However, Genson never raised any objection thereto when he entered his plea of not guilty to the Information nor did he raise the same before, during, after trial, in his memorandum or in his petition. In fact, he included Criminal Case No. 1251 as one of the appealed cases. Thus, unlike the other petitioners heretofore mentioned, Genson is considered as having been validly charged and tried in Criminal Case No. 1251.<br><br>Petitioner Genson basically raises the issue of sufficiency of the prosecution evidence to sustain his conviction on the basis of conspiracy. He claims that Sandiganbayan's statement that "a meticulous examination and analysis of the mass of testimonial and documentary evidence presented by the prosecution tends to show the existence of a conspiracy..." was not the kind of proof required to establish conspiracy.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Although the findings of the Sandiganbayan started with such a statement, the entirety of the decision discussed how the crime was committed by means of conspiracy between petitioner Genson and his co-accused. The Sandiganbayan had discussed lengthily how such conspiracy was carried out by the individual collective actions of the regional and district employees which began with the issuances of the fake LAAs and SACDCs, followed by the irregular processing of the supporting documents and the approval of the general vouchers which ended with the payment of the checks to the accused supplier or contractor.<br><br>We agree with the findings of the Sandiganbayan that petitioner Joselito Genson conspired with the other petitioners to commit the crime. Such agreement was manifested in the general vouchers and the checks paid to petitioner Joselito Genson, to wit:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="19%"><div align="center">CC</div></td><td width="12%"><div align="center">RIV</div></td><td width="12%"><div align="center">GV No.</div></td><td width="14%"><div align="center">Date of</div></td><td width="19%"><div align="center">Amount</div></td><td width="24%"><div align="center">Project</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">No</div></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center">Check</div></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center"></div><br></td><td><div align="center">Pinamungahan -</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1255<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">345</div></td><td><div align="center">B-751</div></td><td><div align="center">5-31-77</div></td><td><div align="center">P 43,795.50</div></td><td><div align="center">Aloguinsan Rd.</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1256<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td><td><div align="center">753</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td><td><div align="center">43,504.50</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1250<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">451</div></td><td><div align="center">1081</div></td><td><div align="center">7-28-77</div></td><td><div align="center">43,650.00</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1251<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td><td><div align="center">1065</div></td><td><div align="center">8-1-77</div></td><td><div align="center">43,650.00</div></td><td><p align="center">- do -</p></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1252<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">421</div></td><td><div align="center">961</div></td><td><div align="center">7-13-77</div></td><td><div align="center">39,721.50</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1254<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td><td><div align="center">959</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td><td><div align="center">47,578.50</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1207<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td><td><div align="center">1239</div></td><td><div align="center">9-1-77</div></td><td><div align="center">48,015.00</div></td><td><div align="center">- do -</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1204<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">607</div></td><td><div align="center">1379</div></td><td><div align="center">9-20-77</div></td><td><div align="center">30,433.75</div></td><td><div align="center">Cebu Toledo Rd</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">1205<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup></div></td><td><div align="center">- do -

Such fact supports the findings of respondent court that there was splitting of payments to avoid review by the Regional COA Auditor. Petitioner Genson admits the receipt of said payments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> but claims that he had asked for partial payments to answer for the fuel and oil used and as a down payment for the rented dump trucks and other equipments. However, the summary shows that some checks supported by the same RIV bore the same date or were dated very close to each other. How could such partial payments serve their purported purpose when the checks were received by petitioner supposedly after the alleged deliveries were completed as shown by the tally sheets attached to the general vouchers.<br><br>Petitioner Genson further contends that his conviction was merely based on the pleas of guilty of the two co-accused contractors/suppliers, namely, Erasmo Gabison and Feliciano Echavez;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> that said pleas are not admissible against him considering that he was granted a separate trial by the court.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br>It is settled that if a separate trial is allowed to one of two or more defendants, his testimony therein imputing guilt to any of the co-accused is not admissible against the latter who was not able to cross-examine him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br><br>We have carefully studied the decision of the Sandiganbayan and we find that petitioner Genson, like the petitioners Engineers, was not convicted on the basis solely of the pleas of guilty of his co-accused private contractors/suppliers. The evidence of the prosecution had fully established the conspiracy among the accused and the pleas of guilty of the two contractors were merely considered as confirmatory. Thus, even without such pleas, petitioner Genson's participation in the scheme to defraud the government was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Petitioner Genson claims that the respondent court did not consider the testimonies of his witnesses proving that he prosecuted the questioned projects. We have gone over the testimonies of Genson's witnesses and we find no error committed by the respondent court in not giving them probative value.<br><br>Defense witness Mariano Castro testified that petitioner Genson requested him to utilize his house as resting place for his men while hauling gravel and sand; that their place was not a boarding house nor was he engaged in the business of accepting transients; that he did not know Genson personally;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> that Genson's men stayed in his house for 2-3 weeks which began on the 9<sup>th</sup> of November;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> that he did not accept any rental fees from Genson since the road construction was just in front of his house thus, will be beneficial to him;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> Based on the prosecution's evidence, however, the alleged deliveries of the materials in the Argao section were supposed to have started on November 5 up to 10, 1977,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> or a total of 6 days only contrary to Castro's testimony that Genson's men stayed in his house for 14 to 21 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> Moreover, it is quite unusual that witness Castro would allow the workers of Genson to stay in his house and for free at that when Castro admitted that he did not even know Genson personally, much more the workers.<br><br>Defense witness Perpetua Mercado, barangay captain of Ubo and owner of the quarry where petitioner allegedly hauled limestone, testified that she met Genson for the first time when he asked her permission to allow his men to stay in her sister-in law's house; that she agreed on condition that Genson will fill up the barangay road with grinded materials. There was nothing, however, in Perpetua's testimony explaining why it was her permission that was sought and not of her sister-in-law who lives in the house where Genson's men were supposed to stay. The name of Perpetua's sister-in law was not even made known nor was she presented in court to confirm that Genson's men indeed stayed in her place.<br><br>Perpetua further stated that it took petitioner a month or more to deliver the piles of limestone used in leveling the 12 kms. Montalongon road,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> however, the delivery receipts show that it purportedly took petitioner only 5 days, i.e., November 7 to 12, 1977, to deliver the materials to the project site.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Perpetua's testimony on cross-examination that she was not requested by Genson to testify for him is quite unbelievable. She testified that the last time she saw Genson was in 1977 when the project was still undergoing; that since then she had no communication with him until twelve years later, she received a note at 7:00 a.m. of April 11, 1989 signed by Genson telling her to meet him on the same day at the Capitol building without specifying the subject matter of the meeting;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> that she had traveled ninety kilometers from Barangay Ubo, Dalaguete to Cebu City in order to meet Genson and on the same day was presented as Genson's witness;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> that she only came to know that there were cases filed against Genson involving non-deliveries of materials when she was already being questioned in court; that she was not able to talk to Genson or his lawyer before she was presented as a witness. The behavior shown by Perpetua is contrary to ordinary human experience since a note from somebody whom she was not in close association with and without even a slightest hint on what the meeting would be about, would not prompt her to act on it specially when it was made on such a short notice and such meeting would not only entail expenses on her part but also the inconvenience of traveling a ninety kilometer road just to reach the meeting place.<br><br>Felicidad Obejero testified that she met Genson when he came to haul materials at the river bank of Mananga, Campo 2, in Talisay, Cebu; that after hauling the materials, she collected P1 for every truck that passed by their private road; that she did not know where those gravel and sand taken from the river were unloaded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> Obviously, this testimony has no probative value as it is too general and does not specifically refer to the projects in question.<br><br>We find that the testimonies of petitioner Genson's witnesses do not outweigh the evidence presented by the prosecution that no deliveries were actually made in 1977 in the Cebu 2<sup>nd</sup> HED and that the Sandiganbayan did not commit any error in convicting him.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the convictions of petitioners <b>Rogelio Alvizo</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1153-1159, 1196-1197, 1200, 1242-1245, 1249, 1263-1266, 1272, 1280, 1293-1294, 1302 and 1304, <b>Pompeyo Almagro</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1170-1171, 1182, 1192, 1194-1195, 1201, 1222, 1231, 1233, 1258, 1261, 1291-1292, 1295, 1301, 1319-1324, 1334 and 1337, <b>Catalino Magno, Jr.</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1161, 1165, 1173-1177, 1187-1188, 1196, 1216, 1218, 1246, 1253, 1255, 1257, 1284, 1307, 1319, 1330-1332, <b>Efren Coyoca</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1153, 1155-1159, 1197-1201, 1242-1249, 1261-1266, 1270-1281, 1285-1288, 1290-1306 and 1309-1318, <b>Edgar Osmeña</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1160-1162, 1208-1213, 1226-1229, 1233, 1253, 1257-1260, 1320-1321 and 1325-1326, <b>Guilberto Hermosa</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1160, 1162, 1165, 1172, 1180-1181, 1184, 1190-1191, 1193, 1213-1214, 1221, 1223, 1237, 1240, 1253, 1255-1257, 1262, 1333, 1336, 1339 and 1341, <b>Aniceto Arriola</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1159, 1166-1167, 1169-1171, 1173-1177, 1181, 1189-1190, 1194, 1196, 1198-1200, 1210, 1217, 1221-1222, 1224, 1226-1229, 1233, 1236-1237, 1239-1240, 1245, 1256, 1263, 1265-1272, 1277, 1281-1285, 1288-1289, 1291-1299, 1301, 1306, 1311, 1315, 1317-1319, 1321-1323, 1325, 1327-1332, 1334-1336, 1338, 1340 and 1341, <b>S</b><b>ofronio Mag-uyon</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1341, <b>Santos Cabusas</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1341, <b>Rafael Rabaya, Jr.,</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1159, 1162-1179, 1181-1195, 1197-1207, 1210-1231, 1234-1252, 1254-1256, 1258-1259, 1261-1282, 1284-1288, 1290-1319, 1321-1324 and 1326-1341, <b>Nestor Rabaya </b>in Criminal Cases Nos. 1143-1152, 1155, 1157-1158, 1160-1172, 1174-1192, 1194-1206, 1208-1236, 1238-1247, 1250-1261, 1263-1265, 1267-1276, 1278-1279, 1281-1288 and 1290-1341, and <b>Joselito Genson</b> in Criminal Cases Nos. 1202-1207, 1230-1231, 1250-1259 of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 are hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>The convictions of Rogelio Alvizo in Criminal Cases Nos. 1203, 1204, 1205, 1230, 1281, and 1288; Catalino Magno, Jr. in Criminal Cases Nos. 1162, 1163, 1215, 1217, 1236 and 1238; Pompeyo Almagro in Criminal Case No. 1227 are hereby SET ASIDE and they are ACQUITTED for lack of evidence.<br><br>The convictions of Pompeyo Almagro in Criminal Case No. 1232, Edgar Osmeña in Criminal Case No. 1163, Guilberto Hermosa in Criminal Case No. 1163, Rafael Rabaya in Criminal Case No. 1232 and Joselito Genson in Criminal Case No. 1232 are hereby SET ASIDE considering that they were not charged in the Informations.<br><br>Considering that the Sandiganbayan did not acquit or convict Rafael Rabaya, Jr., in Criminal Cases Nos. 1180, 1283 and 1289; Efren Coyoca in Criminal Case No. 1289; Edgar Osmeña in Criminal Case No. 1232, Aniceto Arriola in Criminal Cases Nos. 1163 and 1232; and Catalino Magno in Criminal Case No. 1241, let the original records of the said cases be remanded to the Sandiganbayan for rendition of the proper verdict on the said petitioners.<br><br>The petition filed by Oscar Belcina in G.R.Nos. 99309-18 had already been DISMISSED in our Resolution dated September 29, 1994 which had already attained finality.<br><br>The name of petitioner Harvey Ruiz in G.R.
