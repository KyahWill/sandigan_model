				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Well-settled is the rule that a final judgment is immutable and unalterable. The only exceptions to this rule are (1) the correction of clerical errors, (2) the so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">nunc pro tunc</span> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and (3) void judgments.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the July 31, 2000 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 29507 which denied petitioners’ Motion to Set Aside the CA Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated September 28, 1995. The assailed Resolution disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>“Finding the opposition of [respondents] to be well-taken, the [Court hereby <span style="font-style: italic;">DENIES</span> the Motion].”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>Petitioners are children of the late Paulino V. Chanliongco Jr., who was the co-owner of a parcel of land known as Lot No. 2-G of Subdivision Plan SWO No. 7308. Situated in Tondo, Manila, it was co-owned by him, his sister Narcisa, and his brothers Mario and Antonio. By virtue of a Special Power of Attorney executed by the co-owners in favor of Narcisa, her daughter Adoracion C. Mendoza had sold the lot to herein respondents on different days in September 1986. Because of conflict among the heirs of the co-owners as to the validity of the sale, respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for interpleader to resolve the various ownership claims.<br><br>The RTC upheld the sale insofar as the share of Narcisa was concerned. It ruled that Adoracion had no authority to sell the shares of the other co-owners, because the Special Power of Attorney had been executed in favor only of her mother, Narcisa.<br><br>On appeal, the CA modified the ruling of the RTC. It held that while there was no Special Power of Attorney in favor of Adoracion, the sale was nonetheless valid, because she had been authorized by her mother to be the latter’s sub-agent. There was thus no need to execute another special power of attorney in her favor as sub-agent. This CA Decision was not appealed, became final and was entered in favor of respondents on August 8, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On April 10, 1999, petitioners filed with the CA a Motion to Set Aside the Decision. They contended that they had not been served a copy of either the Complaint or the summons. Neither had they been impleaded as parties to the case in the RTC. As it was, they argued, the CA Decision should be set aside because it adversely affected their respective shares in the property without due process.<br><br>In denying the Motion of petitioners, the CA cited the grounds raised in respondents’ Opposition: (a) the Motion was not allowed as a remedy under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure; (b) the Decision sought to be set aside had long become final and executory; (c) the movants did not have any legal standing; and (d) the Motion was purely dilatory and without merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issue</span><br></div><br>In their Memorandum, petitioners raise this sole issue for the Court’s consideration:<br><blockquote>“x x x [W]hether the Court of Appeals erred in denying petitioners’ Motion and allowing its Decision dated September 25, 1995 to take its course, inspite of its knowledge that the lower court did not acquire jurisdiction over the person of petitioners and passing petitioners property in favor of respondents, hence without due process of law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court’s Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition is unmeritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Main Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Entitlement to Summons</span></span><br></div><br>It is well settled that a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable. A final judgment may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and whether it will be made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court in the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The only exceptions to this rule are the correction of (1) clerical errors, (2) the so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">nunc pro tunc</span> entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and (3) void judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> To determine whether the CA Decision of September 28, 1995 is void, the failure to implead and to serve summons upon petitioners will now be addressed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>To be able to rule on this point, the Court needs to determine whether the action is <span style="font-style: italic;">in personam</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">in rem</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">quasi in rem</span>. The rules on the service of summons differ depending on the nature of the action.<br><br>An action <span style="font-style: italic;">in personam</span> is lodged against a person based on personal liability; an action <span style="font-style: italic;">in rem</span> is directed against the thing itself instead of the person;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> while an action <span style="font-style: italic;">quasi in rem</span> names a person as defendant, but its object is to subject that person’s interest in a property to a corresponding lien or obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Complaint filed by respondents with the RTC called for an interpleader to determine the ownership of the real property in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Specifically, it forced persons claiming an interest in the land to settle the dispute among themselves as to which of them owned the property. Essentially, it sought to resolve the ownership of the land and was not directed against the personal liability of any particular person. It was therefore a real action, because it affected title to or possession of real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> As such, the Complaint was brought against the deceased registered co-owners: Narcisa, Mario, Paulino and Antonio Chanliongco, as represented by their respective estates.<br><br>Clearly, petitioners were not the registered owners of the land, but represented merely an inchoate interest thereto as heirs of Paulino. They had no standing in court with respect to actions over a property of the estate, because the latter was represented by an executor or administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, there was no need to implead them as defendants in the case, inasmuch as the estates of the deceased co-owners had already been made parties.<br><br>Furthermore, at the time the Complaint was filed, the 1964 Rules of Court were still in effect. Under the old Rules, specifically Section 3 of Rule 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> an executor or administrator may sue or be sued without joining the party for whose benefit the action is prosecuted or defended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The present rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> however, requires the joinder of the beneficiary or the party for whose benefit the action is brought. Under the former Rules, an executor or administrator is allowed to either sue or be sued alone in that capacity. In the present case, it was the estate of petitioners’ father Paulino Chanliongco, as represented by Sebrio Tan Quiming and Associates, that was included as defendant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and served summons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As it was, there was no need to include petitioners as defendants. Not being parties, they were not entitled to be served summons.<br><br>Petitioner Florencio D. Chanliongco, on the other hand, was impleaded in the Complaint, but not served summons. However, the service of summons upon the estate of his deceased father was sufficient, as the estate appeared for and on behalf of all the beneficiaries and the heirs of Paulino Chanliongco, including Florencio.<br><br>We also note that the counsel of petitioners, Atty. Felino V. Quiming Jr., is a partner of the law firm that represented the estate of the deceased father. Hence, it can reasonably be expected that the service upon the law firm was sufficient notice to all the beneficiaries of the estate, including Petitioner Florencio D. Chanliongco.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and the assailed Resolution <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>Costs against petitioners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Carpio-Morales, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 3-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id., p. 111.
