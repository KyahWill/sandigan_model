Already on board the tricycle was a lesbian who had a birthmark on the right side of the face and who invited Locil for a joy ride.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Upon instruction of the lesbian, the tricycle driver, whom she did not know but whom she later identified and who answered to the name Rey Sunga (Sunga), repaired to the Mendoza Park.<br><br>At the Mendoza Park, the lesbian alighted and spoke to Jocelyn Tan, the victim, who was dressed in a PINS uniform. The lesbian, together with Jocelyn, then joined Locil aboard the tricycle which was already driven by Inocencio Pascua (Pascua) vice Sunga who had in the meantime left. Still aboard the tricycle, the four of them proceeded to and reached Barangay Irawan, Puerto Princesa City and on reaching a forested area, Jocelyn was met by Sunga who held her and by Ramil Lansang (Lansang) who wrapped his arm around her waist as they dragged her to a nearby “buho” clumps. There, Jocelyn was made to lie down. Her skirt was raised and her panty was taken off by Lansang. As she lay face up with both her hands held by Sunga and Pascua, Lansang stripped naked, placed himself on top of Jocelyn, inserted his penis into her vagina and “seemed to be pumping.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After Lansang, Sunga took turn to have sexual intercourse with Jocelyn as Lansang and one who was not known to Locil and whom the latter described as one who has “chinky” or “narrow eyes,” later identified to be Pascua, kept Jocelyn pinned down by her hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Pascua too subsequently had carnal knowledge of Jocelyn who all along struggled against her malefactors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>After Pascua satisfied his lust, Sunga, with a sharp bladed weapon, stabbed the abdomen of the motionless Jocelyn, drawing her to rise to a sitting position and clutch her abdomen. Sunga then passed on the bladed weapon to Lansang who smashed Jocelyn’s head with an irregularly shaped stone, causing her to fall to the ground lifeless. Locil, who witnessed everything, was then pulled by the lesbian and led back into the tricycle where they awaited Lansang, Sunga and Pascua to ride with them. All five thereafter headed back to Puerto Princesa City proper, leaving Jocelyn’s body behind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>When the five reached the Mendoza Park where Locil alighted, she heard the voice of someone from inside the tricycle warning her to keep mum about the incident, otherwise something would also happen to her. Locil then repaired to her boarding house. Until she was arrested following the discovery on July 12, 1994 of Jocelyn’s corpse, she did not report the incident to anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The other prosecution witnesses provided testimonies pertaining to circumstances <span style="font-weight: bold;">after the fact</span>.<br><br>Oscar Devilleres, a garbage truck driver, recalled that he was on his way home in Jacana, Barangay Bancao-Bancao at 12:30 a. m. of June 30, 1994, a day after the incident, when from a distance of about 30 meters, he saw Lansang walking back and forth and appearing restless near the coffee plantation in Jacana, Barangay Bancao-Bancao where Jocelyn’s body was later found on July 12, 1994. Although it was then nighttime, Devilleres had a good look at Lansang due to the illumination provided by the electric light post under which Lansang was situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Igleceria Gabinete, a resident of Jacana, declared that she was among those who saw the mutilated body of Jocelyn in the morning of July 12, 1994 at a coffee plantation near her place; that in the afternoon of that date and while tending her sari-sari store, a tricycle arrived with three men on board, one of whom, Lito Octac (Octac) alighted, leaving the two inside the tricycle who seemed to be hiding their faces; that one of those two men inside the tricycle inquired from her whether the discovered corpse, that of Jocelyn, was from Barangay Caroray; that the following day, she reported to the police about the three suspicious looking men who went to her store; and that two days later, she was made to, as she did, identify Lansang at the police station as one of the men who went to her store in the afternoon of July 12, 1994 and inquired as to Jocelyn’s corpse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Galahad Tan (Tan), Jocelyn’s father, recounted as follows: During the wake of his daughter at the Sampaton Funeral Parlor, at 1:30 a. m. of July 14, 1994 (15th day following the incident), Lansang arrived and told him as follows: “<span style="font-style: italic;">Total tayo ay magkaisang barangay lang ay ayosin natin itong kaso at magtulungan na lang, mayroon na akong alam na makakapagturo kung sino and may kagagawan sa krimen. Huwag na lang nating sabihin sa mga polis.</span>” When he asked Lansang who he was referring to, Lansang replied that he would return. Lansang did not return, however, prompting Tan to relay to law enforcers the statements of Lansang, his neighbor who was courting Jocelyn at the time and with whose family his own family was in good terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Testifying on the autopsy she conducted on Jocelyn, Dr. Ma. Carla Gallego - Vigonte (Dr. Vigonte) affirmed the following findings in her report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated July 12, 1994:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">POST-MORTEM FINDINGS<br></div><ol><li>The cadaver was seen in advanced stage of decomposition.<br></li><br><li>Depressed fracture noted at the frontal bone of the skull about 2 cm anterior to the bregma, measuring 2.5 cm in width and 3.5 cm in length, with a rounded hole at its right side with irregular edges measuring 4 cm x 5 cm in diameter; with a linear fracture about 2 cm in length extending from the depressed fracture up to the bregma; linear fracture about 3 cm in length along the coronal suture, right side, extending from the hole to the bregma.<br></li><br><li>Multiple linear fracture with lengths ranging from 2 cm to 5 cm, noted at the lambdoid suture, about 2 cm right side of the lambda, extending to the right side of the occipital and parietal bones of the skull.</li></ol>PROBABLE CAUSE OF DEATH: Intracranial Hemorrhage secondary to multiple fractures of the skull.<br></blockquote>Dr. Vigonte opined that a blunt object or instrument like a hard wood or a rock caused the injury noted in post-mortem finding no. 2 which was fatal, it being a deep wound in the skull affecting its inner organ and lacerating the tissues of the brain, thus causing hemorrhage; that for said fatal wound, the assailant was probably at Jocelyn’s left side; that for the injury in post-mortem finding no. 3, the attacker was at the back of Jocelyn; and that in light of the multiple injuries, there were more than one perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Dr. Vigonte was, however, unable to determine whether Jocelyn was also raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The prosecution adduced documentary evidence consisting mainly of two supposed extrajudicial confessions made by Sunga.<br><br>In a sworn statement (Exhibit “A”)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated July 18, 1994 which was executed before SPO2 Jose P.

He obliged and just before reaching their destination, Locil boarded the tricycle. At the gate of the school, Lansang talked to Jocelyn who was then wearing the school uniform after which the two boarded the tricycle which he (Sunga) drove to a spot at the corner of Rizal Avenue and Lacao St. in the Puerto Princesa City proper where the four of them (Sunga, Lansang, Locil and Jocelyn) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transferred to an “owner’s jeep” brought by Octac alias “Toto.”</span> The group then proceeded to and reached Barangay Irawan at around 10:30 a. m. and at a forested area in Sitio Tagaud, everyone alighted except for Octac. Lansang then forcibly undressed Jocelyn and raped her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while he (Sunga) and Locil watched</span>. After consummating his carnal desire, Lansang hit Jocelyn with a 2” x 2” piece of wood on her head and successively on different parts of her body. When Jocelyn was already dead, Locil also whacked Jocelyn’s body many times. The group then headed back to the city proper, leaving Jocelyn’s remains at the scene of the crime.<br><br>In accordance with their previous agreement, he (Sunga), Lansang and Locil returned to Barangay Irawan aboard a jeep driven by Octac four days after June 29, 1994 and took Jocelyn’s body for the purpose of bringing it to Jacana in Barangay Bancao-Bancao in accordance with Lansang’s wish. On their way to Bancao-Bancao, Locil inserted a cigarette into the corpse’s mouth – “…. <span style="font-style: italic;">pinasigarilyo ni [Locil] ang bangkay upang ikubli sa maaaring makakita ang tunay na kaanyuan ni Jocelyn Tan.</span>”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> At Barangay Bancao-Bancao, he (Sunga), Lansang and Locil carried the victim’s body and left the same at a coffee plantation fifty meters away from Jacana Road while Octac served as a lookout by the roadside. On their return to the city, the four parted ways at the corner of Rizal Avenue and Lacao Street. He (Sunga) then drove the tricycle with the marking “Ryan-Ryan” with Locil aboard while Lansang and Octac remained together at the jeep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The above sworn statement bears Sunga’s signature and that of his assisting counsel, Atty. Agustin Rocamora (Atty. Rocamora), Puerto Princesa City Legal Officer.<br><br>Testifying as to the investigation he conducted upon Sunga, SPO2 Janoras recalled that he was on duty at the Puerto Princesa City police precinct in the morning of July 18, 1994 when SPO4 Boy Pantollano and patrolman Bolos arrived together with Sunga. The two brought Sunga inside a room and asked him questions pertaining to Jocelyn’s death and after about thirty minutes, Sunga was presented before him (SPO2 Janoras) for investigation. He initially asked Sunga whether he knew anything about Jocelyn’s death and Sunga replied affirmatively, prompting him to inform him of his rights under custodial interrogation. After Sunga signified his desire to avail of the services of a lawyer, Sunga chose Atty. Rocamora to be his counsel from among the names of lawyers mentioned by him (SPO2 Janoras). He thereupon fetched Atty. Rocamora from his residence. Atty. Rocamora briefly conferred with Sunga, asking him if he wanted to give a confession and informing him of the consequences thereof. Thereafter, the investigation proceeded with Sunga voluntarily giving his answers to questions he (SPO2 Janoras) propounded at the end of which investigation Sunga and Atty.

Shortly after, he and his mother went to the PCI Bank where he, instead of his mother who did not have any identification card and Community Tax Certificate, did the encashing (at 9:53 a. m.) of the checks- (Exhibits “12” and “12-A”).

He loaded all their purchases in a jeep bound for Barangay Bahile from which point they were to be transported via a pump boat to his parent’s home in Barangay Caruray. As his mother no longer showed up, he was constrained to accompany his cargo aboard the jeep which departed at 1:00 p. m. and reached Barangay Bahile at 3:00 p. m. of the same day, June 29, 1994. At Barangay Bahile, he loaded the goods into his boat with the help of the boat driver, Arnel Tulonghari.

Her discharge was ordered in the course of what originally were hearings on the petition of the accused for bail and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after the prosecution had presented several of its witnesses and submitted Locil’s sworn statement</span>. Contrary to accused’s counsels’ argument that a motion for discharge could only be filed during trial on the merits, it could be done at any stage of the proceedings, and discharge can be effected from the filing of the information to the time the defense starts to offer any evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>From the records, it appears that the following conditions for Locil’s discharge under Section 9, Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Court were satisfied:<br><blockquote><ol><li>the discharge must be with the consent of the accused sought to be a state witness;<br></li><br><li>his testimony is absolutely necessary;<br></li><br><li>no other direct evidence is available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed except his testimony;<br></li><br><li>his testimony can be substantially corroborated in its material points;<br></li><br><li>he does not appear to be the most guilty; and<br></li><br><li>he has not at any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude.<br></li></ol></blockquote>It is undisputed that at the start of the trial, the prosecution did not have direct evidence, testimonial or otherwise, to establish the culpability of the accused.<br><br>Based on Locil’s sworn statement, she was <span style="font-weight: bold;">the only person who saw</span> what happened to Jocelyn. Her testimony was thus indispensable. That she did not appear to be the most guilty among the accused and that she had not been convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude were shown, as was the susceptibility of material corroboration of her testimony at the time of her discharge in view of the other evidence in the hands of the prosecution.<br><br>That the trial court ordered Locil’s discharge a day before the scheduled hearing on the motion for her discharge is of no moment. The requirement of “a hearing in support of the discharge” had been substantially complied with when the trial court, during the hearings on the bail petition, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">already received evidence from the prosecution</span> including Locil’s sworn statement and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also heard in open court the defense’s arguments in opposition thereto</span>. A hearing did take place but interspersed with the hearings on the bail petition. So long as the trial court was able to receive evidence <span style="font-weight: bold;">for</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">against</span> the discharge, its subsequent order granting or denying the motion for discharge is in order notwithstanding the lack of actual hearing on said motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In fine, even if Locil’s discharge failed to comply with all the requirements embodied in Section 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, her testimony would not, for that sole reason, be discarded or disregarded for, in the discharge of a co-defendant, the trial court may reasonably be expected to commit error which is not reversible, the underlying principle being that it does not affect the competency and quality of testimony of the discharged defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>From the prosecution evidence, the testimony of the erstwhile accused-turned state witness Locil is the most pivotal, for it is an <span style="font-weight: bold;">eyewitness’</span> account of what transpired before and at the time of Jocelyn’s death.

A legal officer of the city, like Atty.

Rocamora did not, if at all, fully apprise Sunga of his rights and options prior to giving his (Sunga’s) admission. Evidently, Atty. Rocamora, without more, merely acted to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">facilitate</span> the taking of the admission from Sunga.<br><br>Moreover, that Sunga was first questioned by SPO4 Pantollano and Patrolman Bolos before he was investigated by SPO2 Janoras does not escape the attention of this Court. Although Sunga failed to present evidence as to the maltreatment he claimed to have suffered in the hands of SPO4 Pantollano and Patrolman Bolos, he did not have any lawyer by his side <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the time these two policemen started asking him questions about Jocelyn’s death</span>. At that point, Sunga was already under custodial investigation without the assistance of counsel.<br><br>Custodial investigation is the stage “where the police investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">has begun to focus on a particular suspect taken into custody by the police who carry out a process of interrogation that lends itself to elicit incriminating statements</span> (Italics in the original; Emphasis supplied.).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Under such circumstances, this Court cannot but entertain serious misgivings as to the admission Sunga subsequently gave to SPO2 Janoras.<br><br>Like Exhibit “A,” Sunga’s second extrajudicial admission-Exhibit “I” is inadmissible, due to the absence of counsel to assist him when he executed it on August 3, 1994 before the NBI of Puerto Princesa City. Although Sunga declared in open court that he made such admission <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in connection with his desire to apply as state witness</span> which admission he later repudiated, this does not make Exhibit “I” admissible. Sunga was at the time still under detention at the NBI office and had been languishing in jail since his arrest in mid-July 1994. His desire to regain his freedom is not difficult to understand, he having lost it once due to his conviction for another crime. His admission which was done without the benefit of counsel consisted of answers to questions propounded by the investigating agent of the NBI and not of a unilateral declaration of his participation in the crime. To this Court, these conditions are constitutive of an atmosphere pervading that of a custodial investigation and necessitating the assistance of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">competent </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">independent </span>counsel <span style="font-weight: bold;">of Sunga’s choice</span> as a matter of right but which he had none.<br><br>Any information or admission given by a person while in custody which may appear harmless or innocuous at the time without the competent assistance of an independent counsel must be struck down as inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Even if the confession contains a grain of truth or even if it had been voluntarily given, if it was made without the assistance of counsel, it is inadmissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The waiver by Sunga of his right to counsel as contained in his sworn statement-Exhibit “I” was not a valid waiver for, on its face, it was executed not in the presence of counsel, contrary to the express requirement of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Sunga having had no counsel when he made his admission before the NBI and his waiver of the right to have one being invalid, his statement- Exhibit “I” is inadmissible.<br><br>The testimony of Sunga during the preliminary investigation before the Municipal Trial Court whereby he expressly acknowledged having executed Exhibit “A” and affirmed the contents thereof did not render his extrajudicial admission into a judicial one which could be used against him and his co-appellants. Neither could his other statements in such proceeding admitting his participation in the crime be utilized to establish his and the other appellants’ guilt. For in that preliminary investigation, Sunga again was effectively denied of his essential right to counsel. Atty. Rocamora was appointed Sunga’s counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de officio</span> but just like the assistance he extended during the execution of Exhibit “A,” Atty. Rocamora utterly did nothing in defense of Sunga’s cause. While Sunga was being asked by the judge a barrage of questions calling for answers which could and did incriminate him, Atty.

These circumstances in the scheme of things are not indubitable pieces of evidence of a person’s commission of a crime for they are susceptible of explanations which do not necessarily speak of guilt or culpability.<br><br>Standing alone and uncorroborated, can Locil’s testimony serve as a basis for appellants’ conviction?

To recapitulate, Locil claimed that on June 29, 1994 she boarded a tricycle bearing a lesbian who invited her for a joyride, proceeded to the Mendoza Park and picked up Jocelyn, whom she was not acquainted with, then brought by the same tricycle to Irawan where the latter was raped and brutally murdered. In other words, she wanted to convey that she was deliberately brought by appellants with them on June 29, 1994 to the place where they were to carry out, which they did, their abominable acts against Jocelyn. This strikes this Court as improbable if not bizarre. For it is contrary to human nature and experience for those who undertake the commission of a crime to bring a spectator thereof. A criminal would certainly take steps to evade detection or discovery of his criminal act, to keep it from being witnessed or known by others who might later turn against him. Yet, from Locil’s testimony, appellants took the trouble of bringing her to the <span style="font-style: italic;">locus criminis</span> so she could bear witness to a horrible crime which appellants carried out with evident secrecy in a remote, uninhabited place in Puerto Princesa City.<br><br>That appellants required Locil’s presence at the time and place of the crime only to threaten her later against divulging what she had witnessed thus defies comprehension.<br><br>Evidence to be believed should not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but should also be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>This Court is not in fact prepared to accord Locil credibly as a witness. Who can trust one who, in her early teens, gets pregnant, flees home and stays in a boarding house albeit she has no visible means of income to pay therefor, and carries an alias name to evade being traced by her mother and aunt?<br><br>Locil’s testimony on how appellants put her in a position to have direct knowledge of their malevolent acts despite taking measures to conceal their deeds fails to inspire belief and must, therefore, be discredited.<br><br>A serious question too abounds on Locil’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">identification</span> of appellant Pascua as one of those who raped Jocelyn. She described Pascua, the man who according to her raped the victim after appellants Lansang and Sunga did, as having, among other things, <span style="font-style: italic;">singkit</span> (chinky) eyes. But as Pascua did not have <span style="font-style: italic;">singkit</span> eyes, even the trial court was prompted to ask her if she was sure that the third person who raped Jocelyn had <span style="font-style: italic;">singkit</span> eyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Thus, with the court’s approval, the defense made it of record that Pascua did not have chinky eyes, contrary to Locil’s description of him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>The aforementioned observations pertaining to both the weak, incomprehensible voice with which Locil gave her testimony, the improbability with which she was precisely made by appellants to be a witness to their crime, and the failure of her description of Pascua’s eyes to match the latter’s actual physical feature cannot but engender serious doubts as to the reliability of her testimony against all appellants. This Court thus finds her uncorroborated account to have failed the jurisprudentially established touchstone for its credibility and sufficiency, that of straightforwardness and deliberateness, as evidence to warrant appellants’ conviction.<br><br>In light of the weak evidence for the prosecution, the defense of alibi as well as of denial by appellants is accorded credence, for it is precisely when the prosecution’s case is weak that the defense of alibi assumes importance and becomes crucial in negating criminal liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> It bears noting that the alibi proffered by appellants, especially that by Lansang, had been corroborated.<br><br>In fine, regardless of the probative weight of appellants’ alibi, the prosecution still has the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus</span> of proving the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the accused and cannot rely on the weakness of the defense evidence.
