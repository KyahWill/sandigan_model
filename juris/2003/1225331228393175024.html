				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic appeal from the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Oriental Mindoro, Branch 40, in Criminal Cases Nos. 4832 and 4833, convicting appellant Leonito Lorenzo of two counts of qualified rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death for each count, and to pay civil indemnity and moral damages, likewise for each count.<br><center><br><u>The Indictments</u><br></center><br>On October 12, 1995<i>, </i>an Information, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-4832, was filed, charging the appellant with qualified rape.  The accusatory portion of the Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 24th day of July, 1995, <i>at </i>2:30 o'clock in the afternoon, at Barangay Water, Municipality of Baco, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, motivated by lust, lewd design, and by taking advantage of innocence and minority of LEA VANESSA ADAY y DELOS REYES, who is only four (4) years old, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge to said LEA VANESSA ADAY by touching and inserting in some degree his penis within the labia of the pudendum of the offended party but was not able to penetrate deeply due to the accused excitement of the moment caused an untimely ejaculation, all against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>A second Information, docketed as Criminal Case No. C-4833, was filed, where the appellant was also charged with qualified rape. The accusatory portion reads as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 17th day of August, 1995, at around 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, at Barangay Water, Municipality of Baco, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, motivated by lust, lewd design, and by taking advantage of innocence and minority of LEA VANESSA ADAY y DELOS REYES, who is only four (4) years of age, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously had carnal knowledge to said LEA VANESSA ADAY by touching and inserting in some degree his penis within the labia of the pudendum of the offended party but was not able to penetrate deeply due to the accused excitement of the moment caused an untimely ejaculation, all against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellant was arraigned, assisted by counsel, and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.<br><u><center><br>The Evidence of the Prosecution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></center><br></u>Delacrosa Aday and her husband had seven children: Richard, 19 years old; Ruel, 12 years old; Leonel, 10 years old; Leo, 8 years old; Glenver, 7 years old; Lea Vanessa, 4 years old; and Clarissa Apples, 1 1/2<i> </i>years old. Delacrosa made a living by selling vegetables and pastries, while her husband was a fisherman. When the couple parted ways, Delacrosa stayed with her children in Water, Baco, Oriental Mindoro, while her husband resided somewhere in Batangas. Delacrosa lived about 50 meters away from her aunt Lucinia and the latter's husband, Leonito Lorenzo.<br><br>In June 1995, four-year-old Lea Vanessa, who was born on May 15<i>, </i>1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was seated at her mother's lap. Delacrosa was talking to her daughter, and told the child that she was growing up, and that she should not allow others to see or touch her private parts; if she wanted to answer the call of nature, she should be the one to clean her private parts, and not someone else. When Lea asked her mother why, Delacrosa replied that it was bad. Lea then asked her mother why her grandfather Leonito Lorenzo, whom she called "Mamay Lito," stripped off her clothes, fondled her private parts.  Lea recounted how Mamay Lito exposed his private organ and rubbed it against her private parts; she was even asked to hold his private organ and to rub it against her private parts, but she refused. Lea further stated that she noticed something milky coming out from his penis and that Leonito thereafter placed his organ inside his pants. Delacrosa was aghast at her young daughter's revelation.  She wanted to confront her Uncle Leonito, but desisted.<br><br>On July 24, 1997 at 10:00 a.m., Delacrosa and Leo left their house to see a doctor as Leo was ill. Ruel and Leonel were in school, while Richard, Glenver, Lea and Clarissa were left in the house. At about 2:00 p.m., Richard put Clarissa to sleep and left to gather firewood at the foothills. He told Glenver and Lea to go to sleep. Momentarily, Leonito arrived and asked Glenver to buy candies. Glenver left, leaving Lea and Clarissa alone in the house.  Leonito removed his pants and Lea's panties, and placed his penis in her vagina. However, only the tip of his penis touched her vagina.  Shortly thereafter, Leonito left the house.<br><br>Delacrosa and Leo arrived home at 4:00 p.m. Lea told her mother that Leonito had been to their house.  She narrated that when Glenver left to buy candies as instructed, Leonito removed his pants He then removed Lea's panties and knelt on the floor, caressed her vagina and rubbed his penis against it. He tried to insert his penis into her vagina but only the tip of his penis touched her organ. Declacrosa examined her daughter's vagina and saw that it was swollen and reddish. She saw traces of semen in front of Lea's panties.  Delacrosa was so furious that she wanted to kill Leonito.<br><br>At 1:00 p.m. on August 17, 1995, Delacrosa was at the well washing soiled clothes, about 50 meters away from her house. She had instructed Leo, Glenver, Lea and Clarissa to sleep, and that she would be back shortly. On her way to the well, Delacrosa had seen Leonito standing in front of his house.  Aunt Lucinia was also at the well, washing soiled clothes with Delacrosa.  The place was also about 50 meters away from a house which was under construction, that belonged to Eddie delos Reyes, Delacrosa's younger brother.<br><br>In the meantime, Wilson Dulce, a member of the <i>Iglesia</i><i> ni Cristo, </i>was on his way home after gathering nipa palm.  He passed by the house of Eddie delos Reyes and saw Leonito, holding Lea's hand. Wilson spoke with Leonito for about three minutes and then left. It appeared that aside from Lea and Leonito, there was no one else in the house.<br><br>After washing and rinsing clothes, Delacrosa went home. The door was locked. When she eventually got inside the house, she discovered that Lea was not there. Delacrosa was so incensed and, in a loud voice, demanded to know where Lea was. Leo told his mother that Lea had refused to go inside the house after she left, and to tease their sister, he and Glenver closed the door to keep her out.<br><br>Momentarily, Leonito and Lea arrived. Leonito declared that they had been to the "house under construction" owned by Eddie delos Reyes. After Leonito left, Delacrosa noticed that Lea was trembling. Unconsciously, Lea lowered her panties, scratched her crotch and pulled up her panties anew. Suspicious, Delacrosa pulled down Lea's underwear and was shocked when she saw traces of semen in her daughter's navel, her crotch, and the front portion of her panties. Delacrosa asked Lea what happened, but the child merely shook her head in reply. After a couple of hours, Lea calmed down and told her mother that Leonito had removed his pants, then her panties and attempted to insert his penis into her vagina. He failed to do so, as only the tip of his penis was able to penetrate her vagina.<br><br>Delacrosa, who was a member of the <i>Iglesia</i><i> ni Cristo, </i>sought help from their head Avelino Belano and reported the incident to him. Delacrosa brought Avelino to her house and showed him Lea's panties. Avelino noticed that the panties were wet with a sticky substance. He advised Delacrosa to report the matter to the minister of the <i>Iglesia</i><i> ni Cristo, </i>who thereafter advised her to report the incidents involving Leonito and her daughter to the police authorities.<br><br>On September 22, 1995, Delacrosa brought Lea to the police, where she gave a sworn statement to SPO1 Dante Abarquez, subscribed and sworn to before the Presiding Judge of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Puerto Galera. Delacrosa also executed a sworn statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Mother and daughter signed two criminal complaints for rape against Leonito, thereafter filed with the Municipal Circuit Trial Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As suggested by the public prosecutor, Delacrosa brought Lea to the Provincial Health Office on October 19, 1995 where Dr. Romeo G. Andal, Medical Officer V, conducted a physical examination of Lea.  The doctor's report contained the following findings:<br><blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="4">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10%"> <br></td> <td width="13%">HEENT</td> <td width="13%">]</td> <td width="64%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td>C/L</td> <td>]</td> <td>No abrasions nor hematoma </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td>Abdomen</td> <td>]</td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4">VAGINAL SPECULUM &amp; INTERNAL EXAMINATION : </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="3">-Absence of pubic hair, with complete healed hymenal lacerations on 2, 5, 7 &amp; 9 o'clock positions </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="3">- Vagina — admits the 5th finger with ease. </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="3"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="4">LABORATORY EXAMINATION: </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="3">Cervice vaginal smear for the presence of spermatoza revealed.<br> Negative result. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8] </sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u>The Evidence of the Accused</u><br></div><br>Leonito denied the charge.  He testified that on July 24, 1995,<i> </i>he was busy plowing his ricefield, which was about nine meters away from his house. At noontime, while he and his wife Lucinia were resting, Delacrosa arrived and asked Lucinia to take care of her children as Leo had to be brought to the doctor.  Lucinia agreed and took care of Delacrosa's children until 4:00 p.m. when Delacrosa arrived home from the clinic.  There were other previous occasions when Lucinia took care of the children while Delacrosa was away.<br><br>Leonito insisted that he could not have possibly molested Lea on August 17, 1995. He was in the house of Eddie delos Reyes, which was about ten meters away from his house. Delacrosa and his wife Lucinia were then at the well washing soiled clothes.<br><br>Leonito averred that the charges against him were instigated by Delacrosa because she was envious of him; the farmland, which her deceased mother and her aunt Lucinia inherited from their parents, were given to him to till and work on. Instead of suing Leonito and Lucinia, Delacrosa fabricated the charges and ordered her daughter Lea to testify against him.<br><br>Lucinia corroborated her husband's testimony. She testified that she asked Delacrosa to have Lea examined by a doctor but Delacrosa refused. She demanded that Delacrosa drop the charges against Leonito because they were baseless, but Delacrosa refused.<br><u><center><br>The Verdict of the Trial Court<br></center><br></u>After trial, the court rendered judgment convicting Leonito with two counts of qualified rape. The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, finding the accused Leonito Lorenzo y Maligo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape (2 counts) with the qualifying circumstance that the victim is a child below 7 years old, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the maximum of two (2) death penalties, together with the accessory penalties as provided for by law, and to indemnify the victim Lea Vanessa Aday the amount of fifty thousand (p50,000.00) pesos for each crime of rape or a total amount of one hundred thousand (P100,000.00) pesos, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the appellant asserts that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt for the felonies charged beyond reasonable doubt. He contends that the private complainant admitted in her testimony that he merely removed her panties but did nothing to her private parts; and that she was merely instructed by her mother Delacrosa to testify that the appellant had raped her. The Office of the Solicitor General, for its part, argues that the appellant merely nit-picked the testimony of the private complainant and ascribed ill motive to her mother, in a last ditch effort to extricate himself from certain conviction. It contends that in calibrating the testimony of the private complainant, the entirety of her testimony must be considered.<br><br>We agree with the Office of the Solicitor General. In rape cases, the testimony of the private complainant must be considered and calibrated in its entirety and not merely by truncated portions or isolated passages thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The true meaning of answers to isolated questions is to be ascertained by due consideration of all the questions propounded to the witness and her answers thereto. To distill the facts established by the testimony of a witness, everything stated by her on direct examination, on cross-examination, redirect and re-cross-examination must be considered. Facts imperfectly or incompletely stated in answer to one or more questions on direct examination supplied by her answers to other questions on redirect or re-cross-examination; and when from one statement considered by itself an inference may be deduced, that inference may be strengthened or repelled by the facts disclosed in another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The testimonies of witnesses must not be merely selected to conveniently suit the claim of a party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In <i>People v. Ortega,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><i> </i>this Court ruled:<br><blockquote>It is sound policy that self-contradictions in testimonies should be reconciled, if possible, the rule being the same as that which obtains where witnesses apparently contradict each other. These contradictory statements should be considered in light of explanations and attending circumstances, and whether inconsistencies or incongruities result from misconception of an innocent witness or willful and corrupt misrepresentation.v... <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the appellant merely quoted a portion of the private complainant's testimony on redirect examination which appeared to support the claim that he did not insert his penis into the vagina of the victim:<br><blockquote> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="left">PROS.

He would be guilty only of acts of lasciviousness.  However, the rest of the testimony of the private complainant conclusively proves that she was raped by the appellant.  She testified on direct examination, redirect examination and even on re-cross-examination that the appellant had raped her.

testified not only on the number of times she was raped by the appellant, but also indicated the places where she was raped, and revealed the details relating to the crimes. Although the private complainant mistakenly testified that the house under construction where she was raped was owned by the appellant, when in fact the house was owned by Eddie delos Reyes, Delacrosa's younger brother and the private complainant's uncle, such mistake should not be taken against a four-year-old girl, who innocently thought that the appellant owned the house.<br><br>The Medical Certificate issued by Dr. Romeo Andal regarding the physical examination conducted on the private complainant confirms the veracity of the private complainant's testimony, that she was raped by the appellant not only on July 24 and August 17, 1995,<i> </i>but on other occasions as well. The doctor found completely-healed hymenal lacerations at two o'clock, five o'clock, seven o'clock and nine o'clock positions and that the vagina admitted the entry of the fifth finger with ease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In <i>People v.

However, such circumstance should not discredit her and her testimony. It must be stressed that Lea was barely four years old when she was raped and when she testified. She could not be expected to understand every question asked of her in the course of examination. Ample margin of error and understanding should be accorded to Lea who, much more than adults, would be gripped with tension due to the novelty of the experience of testifying before a court.<br><br>Error-free testimony cannot be expected, most especially when a witness is recounting vivid details of a harrowing experience, one which even an adult would like to bury in oblivion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Victims of rape often take into memory lapses in their desire to forget their dreadful experiences.

She may have been confused as to the exact details of each and every sexual abuse she was subjected to by the appellant.  It is in fact expected that such a victim would rather wish and even purposely forget the abhorrent memories of every single occasion.  It would be exacting too much should the Court demand a very accurate and flawless account of the two crimes subject of her charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> It is not unnatural for inconsistencies to creep into the testimony of a rape victim, especially one who is of tender age as the victim Lea, in narrating the details of her shocking experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court is inclined to believe that the incident referred to by the private complainant on redirect examination was that which she revealed to Delacrosa, her mother, in June 1995 as gleaned from the latter's testimony, thus:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Prior to July 24, 1995, did you have any conversation with your daughter Leah <i>(sic) </i>Vanessa about his Mamay Lito?

In this case, Delacrosa sought the prosecution and conviction of the appellant, her uncle no less, for his bestial acts on her hapless daughter. Before she did, she sought counsel from officials of the <i>Iglesia</i><i> ni Cristo, </i>of which she was a member. Her collective acts were not those of a depraved mother, but one who sought justice for her daughter.

Delacrosa testified that the properties which her mother and her siblings had inherited from their parents had already been divided among the heirs.

Case law has it that the calibration by the trial court of the testimonial evidence of the parties and its assessment of the probative weight thereof are accorded by the appellate court high respect, if not conclusive effect, precisely because of the unique advantage of the trial court of observing and monitoring at close range the demeanor and deportment of the witnesses as they testify. We find no reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court and its assessment of the credibility and probative weight of the testimonial evidence on record.<br><br>The appellant's bare denial of the crimes charged are mere negative self-serving evidence and cannot prevail over the testimony of the prosecutrix and her witnesses, which the trial court found positive, credible and entitled to full probative weight. The appellant's alibi is likewise barren of merit, given the proximity of the house of the appellant to the house of Delacrosa and that of Eddie delos Reyes, where the appellant raped the victim. Alibi is a weak, if not the weakest of defenses. The appellant is burdened to adduce clear and convincing evidence that he was in a place other than the <i>situs</i><i> </i>of the crime at the time of its commission such that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The appellant failed to prove his alibi, relying solely on his fragile testimony.<br><center><br><u>The Crimes Committed by the Appellant<br>and the Proper Penalties Therefor</u><br></center><br>The trial court correctly ruled that the appellant is guilty of two counts of rape under Article <i>335 </i>of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, by Republic Act No. 7659<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed. </i>- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><ol type="1"><li>By using force or intimidation;<br><br></li><li>When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br></li><li>When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br></div></blockquote>The trial court also correctly sentenced the appellant to suffer the death penalty. The private complainant was barely four years old when she was raped by the appellant. Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 7659, the death penalty shall be imposed if the victim is a child below seven years old:<br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><center>...<br></center><ol start="4"><li> when the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.<br></li></ol></blockquote><center><u>Civil Liabilities of the Appellant</u><br></center><br>The trial court ordered the appellant to pay to private complainant Lea Vanessa Aday the amount of P50,000 as civil indemnity for each of the two crimes.
