				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Republic Act No. 8385, otherwise also known as the Anti-Rape Act of 1997, has incorporated a new chapter in the Revised Penal Code.  In a new provision, designated Article 266-A, the crime of rape is committed either by <i>sexual intercourse</i> or by <i>sexual assault.  </i>Rape by sexual intercourse, pursuant to the first paragraph of the article, is committed by a <i>man </i>who shall have carnal knowledge of a <i>woman </i>under any of the following circumstances; <i>viz</i>: <br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%"><div align="left">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Through force, threat, or intimidation; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">(c)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">(d) </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The last of the enumeration, item (d) above, constitutes what is so often referred to as statutory rape.  Rape by sexual assault, mentioned in the second paragraph of the same article, is committed by <i>any person </i>who, under any of the aforestated circumstances, inserts his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person.<br><br>Appellant Jaime Olaybar y Odtuhan, a.k.a. Jimmy, was charged with two counts of rape, the first for statutory rape under the first paragraph of Article 266-A and the second for rape by means of sexual assault under the second paragraph of the article, in separate informations that read:<br><blockquote><center><b>Criminal Case No. 00-1600</b><br></center><br>"That on or about the 5<sup>th</sup> day of September, 2000, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, JAIME OLAYBAR y ODTUHAN, by means of force and intimidation did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant, ROSE ANN INTO Y AVENIDO, a minor, eight (8) years of age, against her will and consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><center><br><b>Criminal Case No. 00-1601</b><br></center><br>"That on or about the 6<sup>th</sup> day of September 2000, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, JAIME OLAYBAR Y ODTUHAN, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit acts of sexual assault by inserting his penis into the anus of complainant, ROSE ANN INTO Y AVENIDO, a minor, eight (8) years of age, against the latter's will and by means of force and intimidation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Olaybar entered a plea of "not guilty" to both charges; the cases were consolidated and tried jointly with the prosecution and the defense, in that order, presenting their respective versions of the case.<br><br>Rose Ann Into y Avenido, an eight-year old child, lives with her family at 2297 F.B. Harrison Street, Pasay City, in a squatter's area close to a parking lot opposite the Meralco office. On 05 September 2000, around seven o'clock in the evening, Rose Ann was playing with her friends when Olaybar brought her to a parked jeepney in the nearby parking lot.  Inside the jeepney, Olaybar made Rose Ann lie down and had his penis inserted into her vagina.  After a while, Olaybar made her sit on his lap and put his penis inside her anus. That night, when brought home by Olaybar, Rose Ann told her mother, Rea, that Olaybar molested her.  Rea confronted Olaybar but the latter denied having done anything to Rose Ann.  Rea warned Olaybar never to come near Rose Ann again.  The following evening, on 06 September 2000, between seven o'clock and seven-thirty, Olaybar called Rose Ann and, despite the warning made the previous night, he again brought her to a parked jeepney, made her sit on his lap and inserted his penis into her anus.  He then escorted her home.  Rose Ann, just as before, told her mother of what had transpired.  Rea confronted Olaybar but the latter once more denied any wrongdoing.  Rea sought the help of one Roger Siobert and, this time, Olaybar admitted to Roger what he had done.  Rea went to the police to report the incident.<br><br>When brought to the hospital on 07 September 2000, Rose Ann was examined by Dr. Merle P. Tan of the Child Protection Unit of the UP-PGH.  The genital and anal examination disclosed the following findings:<br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><b>"GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</b> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="37%"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td width="63%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">HEIGHT 112 cm WEIGHT 17.5 kg TANNER STAGE 2</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">GENERAL SURVEY </div></td> <td><div align="justify">No stunting, No wasting, Ambulant, Not</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">In Respiratory Distress</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">MENTAL STATUS</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Oriented to place and person</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Conscious</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">PERTINENT PHYSICAL</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Breast Tanner Stage: 2</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">FINDINGS / PHYSICAL </div></td> <td><div align="justify">(R)-&gt;LOWER EXTREMITIES-&gt;</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">INJURIES </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Gluteals-&gt;
