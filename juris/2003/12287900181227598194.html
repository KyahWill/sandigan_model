				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The peculiar nature of rape is that conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely upon the word of the private complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> because it is essentially committed in relative isolation or even secrecy and it is usually only the victim who can testify with regard to the act of forced coitus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Thus, the long standing rule is that when an alleged victim of rape says she was violated, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has indeed been committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Since the participants are usually the only witnesses in crimes of this nature and the accused’s conviction or acquittal virtually depends on the complainant’s testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> it must be received with utmost caution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It is then incumbent upon the trial court to be very scrupulous in ascertaining the credibility the victim’s testimony. Judges must free themselves of the natural tendency to be overprotective of every woman claiming to have been sexually abused and demanding punishment for the abuser. While they ought to be cognizant of the anguish and humiliation the rape victim goes through as she demands justice, judges should equally bear in mind that their responsibility is to render justice according to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Pauline Pacurib was allegedly molested and raped during a blow-out she hosted for having been promoted in her job at the local rural bank.

Her story, as summed up in the People’s Brief, narrates that:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> After coming from work in the afternoon of February 9, 1996 complainant Pauline Pacurib of Paete, Laguna proceeded to the house of Katrina “Jingle” Kaharian in Pakil, Laguna. She was there to fulfill a promise she made the day before to give a blow-out for their friends.<br><br></li><li> Complainant was having dinner with Jingle when accused Airoll Aclan arrived. He informed them that their friends were already waiting in a hut located in Burgos St., Pakil, Laguna. The hut is owned by one Arvin Mapagdalita.<br><br></li><li> Before leaving the house of Jingle, Dante Pendon arrived and got two bottles of gin from Jingle’s store. The bottles of gin were paid for by complainant. They then proceeded to the hut.<br><br></li><li> Upon arriving at the hut, they saw Robert Entienza, Arvin Mapagdalita, Ise Aclan, Necy Adarlo, Jay Salem. By that time, these men who call themselves <i>Restback Boys</i> had already consumed two bottles of gin. Minutes later, appellant arrived.<br><br></li><li> Complainant was given a shot of gin to drink. She obliged. After a while, she was given another shot. She felt dizzy and weak after finishing the second shot. She was given noodles to eat but she only ate two spoonfuls and then fell asleep.<br><br></li><li> She remembered that she was awakened when Dante Pendon held her thigh and left breast. She was hurt. She got wild and shouted, “<i>Walanghiya ka</i>,” referring to Dante Pendon. Without knowing why she was furious, Jingle slapped her and separated them. Pauline cried helplessly then Jay Salem placed her on the bench beside the bed. There, she fell down. She was very weak and dizzy.<br><br></li><li> The next thing she remembered was Airoll Aclan touching the different parts of her body.<br><br></li><li> From where she was seated she was pulled by Airoll and brought to appellant. Airoll held her hands and with appellant’s help, they were able to remove her pants and panty. Appellant then opened the zipper of his pants and inserted his penis inside her vagina.<br><br></li><li> She felt pain. She tried to struggle, fight back, and shout, but she was not able to do so. She was very weak and dizzy.<br><br></li><li> During the act, Airoll told her not to be “<i>magulo</i>” and covered her mouth. Airoll also told her, that if she was still be “<i>magulo</i>” she will be boxed, and indeed, was boxed by Lawrence at her stomach. Thereafter, she lost consciousness and regained it at around 5:00 o’clock in the early morning of February 10, 1996.<br><br></li><li> While all these were happening, Jingle was fast asleep while another lady friend Nesy Adarlo was heavily drunk. All other people were out of the <i>nipa</i> hut.<br><br></li><li> She immediately stood up when she regained consciousness at around five in the morning of February 10, 1996. She had no pants on when she woke up. She hurriedly left the place with Nesy. She passed by Jingle’s place and get her belonging and went straight home.<br><br></li><li> When she arrived home that day, she locked herself inside her room. Late that night, her mother inquired about her whereabouts the previous night. She narrated her harrowing experience to her mother. The next day, she went to her friend Mercy Magsalansan who accompanied her to their Barangay Captain. Upon learning from their Barangay Captain that the case does not fall within his jurisdiction, they proceeded to the police authorities of Pakil, Laguna. SPO1 Romeo Criste took her statement. After her statements were taken by the authorities, she went to General Cailles Memorial Hospital for examination.<br><br></li><li> The prosecution likewise presented Dra. Caridad Rallos, who identified the medical certificate containing the results of the medical examination she conducted on the complainant on February 11, 1996. She found bluish discolorations in the upper left arm and lower right arm of the complainant. She also found small superficial lacerations with fresh blood, multiple abrasions in the complainant’s vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The defense’s version, on the other hand, is a sordid narrative of fatal attraction and unrequited love. It paints a picture of a licentious woman obsessed, scorned and spurned, whose unreciprocated affection turned into vindictive hate which spurred her to file the instant case out of spite.<br><br>At the outset the defense points out that while rape is usually committed in relative isolation and involves only the victim and her abuser, this case is exceptional because there were twelve persons in the hut of Arvin Mapagdalita, including the complainant, on the evening of February 9, 1996 when the alleged rape was perpetrated. Out of the persons who were there, nine, including accused-appellant Macapanpan, categorically testified that the latter <i>did not</i> rape the victim and that <i>no one</i> was raped that night. Prosecution witness Necy Adarlo, who was also present, testified similarly. The implausibility of the commission of the felony is further underscored by the fact that the hut has a dimension of only 4.97 by 3.14 square meters and the room where the crime was allegedly committed measures around 3.14 by 3.14 square meters. This small space housed <i>all</i> twelve persons at that time.<br><br>Accused-appellant Macapanpan claims he did not know the victim personally prior to February 8, 1996. While he used to see complainant in church, he has never talked to her. On February 8, 1996, Pauline Pacurib went to the store of Katrina “Jingle” Kaharian and informed her that she was promoted. Pauline promised to give a blow-out the following day, February 9, 1996, at Arvin Mapagdalita’s hut located on Burgos Street, Pakil, Laguna, which was the favorite hang-out of Jingle’s group.<br><br>As promised, Pauline arrived at Jingle’s house at 7:00 p.m. of February 9, 1996, ate supper, left money to buy two small bottles of gin and proceeded to the hut with Jingle and accused-appellant Airoll Aclan. At the hut, they found Arvin Mapagdalita, Benny Liza “Ise” Aclan, Necy Adarlo, Desiderio “Jay” Salem, Dante Pendon, Eman Macapanpan and Robert “Bobet” Entienza. Accused-appellant Lawrence “Oyen” Macapanpan and Jojo Martinez arrived later.<br><br>The group sang, conversed and drank gin. Accused-appellant Macapanpan joined in the singing but did not drink. Arvin Mapagdalita sang a song with Ise Aclan. Before they could finish their song, Pauline suddenly blurted out, “<i>Makakarma rin kayo, makakarma ka Arvin</i>.” It appeared that she liked Arvin and was jealous because his attention was drawn to Ise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> She got hysterical, so Airoll Aclan and Jay Salem restrained her. Jingle asked her to stop struggling and, when she refused, she slapped her on the face once or twice. Jay Salem asked her to sit on the bed. To avoid any further incident, Arvin and Ise went outside the hut.<br><br>Accused-appellant Lawrence Macapanpan was near the door when the commotion occurred. Pauline smiled at him, approached him and kissed him on the right cheek. Lawrence distanced himself from Pauline and went to the sink to wash his face. Pauline reeked of liquor. Lawrence then sat on the long bench near the door. Pauline sat beside him and told him that all the members of the Jingle’s group, called the <i>Restback</i>, were all rude while he was kind. She asked him if he is a member of the <i>Restback</i>, that if he and Arvin are cousins and whether he can bring her closer to Arvin. Lawrence replied that if Arvin does not love her, he can not do anything. Complainant returned to bed and slept together with Jingle and Nesy. Lawrence reclined on the bench and slept for around thirty minutes. When he woke up, he saw Airoll Aclan, Jay Salem, Jingle Kaharian and Necy Adarlo lying in bed talking to each other.<br><br>Bobet Entienza and Eman Macapanpan left at around 10:00 p.m., while Ise Aclan, Arvin Mapagdalita, Dante Pendon and Jojo Martinez left at 1:00 a.m. Jay Salem, Necy Adarlo, Jingle Kaharian, accused-appellant Lawrence Macapanpan and complainant Pauline Pacurib were left behind. At around 5:00 a.m., Pauline and Necy left the hut while Jay Salem and Lawrence Macapanpan stayed behind.<br><br>Pauline Pacurib went to the house of Jingle Kaharian and slept beside her. Later she talked to the sister of Jingle. She told her that the members of the <i>Restbacks</i> were all rude and only accused-appellant Lawrence Macapanpan was kind. She denounced her love for Arvin Mapagdalita and tore up his picture. She wrote a letter to Jingle apologizing for her behavior the night before, and handed it to her when she woke up. Pauline then left Jingle’s house at 7:30 a.m. together with Jingle’s sister, Shana, and went home to Paete.<br><br>At around 10:00 a.m. of February 11, 1996, while accused-appellant Lawrence Macapanpan was at Burgos Street, Pakil, Laguna, talking with Bobet Entienza and Arvin Mapagdalita, Pauline called him. She asked him where she got the hematoma on her neck. He told her that he did not know how she got it. After the conversation, they parted.<br><br>In the afternoon of February 11, 1996, Lawrence Macapanpan celebrated his birthday at his house in Burgos Street, Pakil, Laguna. The <i>Restback</i> group was there, together with Pauline. During the party, they learned that Necy Adarlo was investigated by the police in connection with a case Pauline was intending to file against all those who were present at the hut on February 9, 1996. Pauline confirmed this and said the complaint was not yet finished. She told them that she was filing the case upon instructions of her mother, however, she was having second thoughts about filing the same. Later, she was fetched by her mother and aunt.<br><br>The following morning, Lawrence and his friends went to the municipal building to find out if the case was filed by Pauline against them. However, they were unable to talk to the police investigator. The group then went home. On February 13, 1996, the two accused were served with a warrant for their arrest and were incarcerated.<br><br>In a litany of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> we have held that in reviewing charges of rape, we are guided by the settled principles that: (a) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; while the commission of the crime may not be easy to prove, it becomes even more difficult for the person accused, although innocent, to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are normally involved, the testimony of the complainant must always be scrutinized with great caution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (c) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and can not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, in a prosecution for rape, the complainant’s credibility becomes the single most important issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, while there were several persons present at the time of the alleged rape, the court <i>a quo</i> relied heavily, if not entirely, on her testimony. A review, however, of the records of the case will show that the testimony of the complaining witness is flawed with serious inconsistencies, contradictions and incredulous statements.<br><br><i><u>First</u></i>, the narration of the manner in which accused-appellant Macapanpan allegedly ravished complainant strains credulity. She was allegedly raped in a standing position by Macapanpan while she was being held from behind by Airoll Aclan. She declared that at the time of the alleged rape she was very dizzy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> from the gin she drank,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and continuously sagged to the ground. It must be noted in this regard that private complainant, Lawrence Macapanpan and Airoll Aclan are almost the same height,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and on account of her alleged intoxication she presented a dead weight to Airoll Aclan who was merely a stripling of sixteen years at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Attempting penile penetration, much less consummating the sexual act under such circumstances, would be next to impossible considering complainant’s drunken state as a result of which she kept falling to the ground and had to be held up. Indeed, the paucity of complainant’s claim that accused-appellant Macapanpan had carnal knowledge of her is best demonstrated by no less than her own narrative, where she declared that both accused-appellants had difficulty in perpetrating the act because Aclan had a hard time spreading her thighs in that position:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td colspan="2">Atty.

She admitted as much to Necy Adarlo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> She even requested Macapanpan to act as “bridge” for her to get Mapagdalita’s attention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In fact, complainant dropped not so subtle hints about her feelings to Mapagdalita in several letters and cards<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> she sent to the latter. The most revealing of these was a Christmas Card<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated December 25, 1995 where, aside from an enclosed typewritten Christmas greeting,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> was a handwritten note<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which reads:<br><blockquote>Arvin,<br><br>I’m still here for you!

Complainant apparently sought the cooperation of Mapagdalita’s group, the <i>Restbacks</i>, to convince him to like her. She also tried to ingratiate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> herself to the group by hanging out with them, to no avail. Matters came to a head on that fateful night when, upon seeing Ise Aclan and Arvin Mapagdalita singing together, she blurted out in a fit of jealous pique “<i>Makakarma din kayo</i>!”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thereafter, she went into hysterics and had to be pacified.<br><br><i><u>Sixth</u></i>, The conduct of the victim immediately following the alleged sexual assault is of utmost importance in establishing the truth or falsity if the charge of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In the case at bar, the actuations of complainant after the alleged rape is totally uncharacteristic of one who has been raped. It is contrary to normal human behavior for complainant to willingly go with Necy Adarlo, Jingle Kaharian and Ise Aclan to the birthday party of one of her supposed abusers two days after the alleged sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>It is also worth noting that upon awakening from her supposed drunken stupor the next morning and finding her alleged rapist still there with her and her two other friends, there was no reaction from her at all. There was neither anger nor hysterics of the kind she displayed the night before; nor was there any recrimination for the alleged sexual attack committed on her. Curiously, she also tarried at the <i>locus criminis</i> instead of hastily leaving the scene of her supposedly harrowing experience, although she woke up earlier than accused-appellant Macapanpan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Indeed, it goes against the grain of human experience for a woman who has been robbed of her honor and chastity not to seize an opportunity to escape from the clutches of her malefactors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Moreover, it is unusual that when she left the hut, she did not immediately seek the assistance of her friend and <i>kumadre</i>, Mercy “<i>Diday</i>” Manalansan, a Barangay Secretary who lived in Barangay Burgos. This circumstance only raises even more doubts on her claim of rape more so considering that there has been no showing that she was threatened by the group not to disclose the alleged incident.<br><br><i><u>Seventh</u></i>, by the same token, it also is out of the ordinary for accused-appellant Macapanpan to remain in the hut up to the next day instead of immediately leaving to avoid reprisal for the rape he allegedly committed. As held in <i>People v. Licayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the unexplained flight of the accused may as a general rule be taken as evidence of his guilt. The case at bar involves the converse situation. Instead of fleeing, accused-appellant was the last person to leave the hut with Jay Salem,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> thirty minutes after complainant and Necy Adarlo left at 5:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>A conviction in a criminal case must be supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt, which means a moral certainty that the accused is guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The prosecution has failed to discharge its burden of establishing with moral certainty the truthfulness of the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>To reiterate, the testimony of the offended party in crimes against chastity should not be received with precipitate credulity for the charge can easily be concocted. Courts should be wary of giving undue credibility to a claim of rape, especially where the sole evidence comes from an alleged victim whose charge is not corroborated and whose conduct during and after the rape is open to conflicting interpretations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> While judges ought to be cognizant of the anguish and the humiliation that a rape victim undergoes as she seeks justice, they should equally bear in mind that their responsibility is to render justice based on the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The numerous inconsistencies in the testimony of the private complainant have created reasonable doubt in our mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In view of the foregoing considerations, the presumption of innocence in favor of accused-appellants must be upheld considering that the evidence at hand falls short of the quantum of proof to support a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Siniloan, Laguna, Branch 33, in Criminal Case No. S-1943, finding accused-appellants Lawrence Macapanpan y de Guzman and Airol Aclan y Mendoza guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE.</b> Lawrence Macapanpan y de Guzman and Airoll Aclan y Mendoza are <b>ACQUITTED</b> on the ground of reasonable doubt.
