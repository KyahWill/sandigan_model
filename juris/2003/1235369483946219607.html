Responding, Guinaja rushed towards their house and poured water on the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> His sister Erlinda also helped by putting a blanket around the victim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> who, as she was being brought to the hospital, uttered "Papa, I love you."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Defense witness Erlinda, sister of appellant, corroborated appellant's testimony regarding her extension of assistance to the victim and the utterance by the victim of "Papa, I love you."<br><br>Erlinda disputed prosecution witness Cadavis' claim that he heard the victim utter repeatedly at the hospital "<i>Ate tulungan mo ako, sinunog ako</i>," averring that the victim "would not ask any help from [her] if she was burned by others."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Finding for the prosecution and noting that the killing was attended "by the aggravating circumstance that the accused employed means to weaken the defense by splashing an accelerant on the victim's face, which mode of attack was calculated to insure the commission of the crime without risk to the offender," the trial court convicted appellant in the appealed Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, this court hereby finds the accused Gerrymel Estillore y Postico guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <b>Murder </b>as charged in the Information, accordingly hereby sentences him to suffer the supreme penalty of <b>death</b>; and he is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of the deceased P50,000.00 as indemnity; P100,000.00 as moral damages; and P21,500.00 as actual damages.

But he did not. Instead, he carried their child, left the victim burning, and exited through the window, and it was only after Guinaja had come out of his house, after being attracted by the "brightness" of the fire, that he (appellant), in a "soft voice," asked for help. Such line of conduct does not speak of his innocence. His explanation of how his left side of his body and his left arm got burned -- while embracing the victim in an attempt to put off the fire -- does not convince for, as earlier stated, if by his claim, the victim's "right thigh from the middle portion of it upward" was burning, he could have easily extinguished the fire. Why he got burned could possibly have been occasioned when, in light of the doctor's opinion, "[t]he assailant tried to splash [the victim] with the accelerant several times and then lighted her lamp."<br><br>If, by the claim of the defense, the victim uttered "Papa, I love you" as she was being carried to, and while on board the tricycle, to thereby suggest that appellant had nothing to do with her burning, why did not appellant utter a word, as he himself admitted as did his sister? Would not an innocent "spouse," under the circumstances, have uttered words and showed gestures of endearment, comfort and assurance that she would be alright?<br><br>If the victim had committed suicide as suggested by the defense, why would she beg the doctor at the Divine Grace Hospital to help her, "<i>parang awa na ninyo</i>," just as she did seek help from Guinaja and Erlinda, but never from appellant.<br><br>Appellant's sister Erlinda's denial that the victim had told her in the hospital that "<i>sinunog ako</i>," she (Erlinda) averring that the victim "would not ask any help from [her] if she was burned by others," does not lie not only because such justification defies comprehension but also because of the unassailed credibility of Cadavis who early on or two days after the incident stated in his sworn statement before the police that the victim had made such utterance.<br><br>It cannot then be gainsaid that a combination of all these enumerated circumstances, along with the unrefutted opinion of Dr. Bautista, that:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">A</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">x x x <u>It is possible that the victim received the splashes of that accelerant in a way that the accelerant was placed in a container and the assailant tried to splash her with the accelerant several times and then lighted her up explaining the fact that the burns that resulted were the so-called patterned burns.</u> (Underscoring supplied),</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>points to appellant as the one who set the victim on fire which caused her death.<br><br>Appellant having failed to disprove the prosecution evidence showing his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the affirmance of his conviction for murder under Article 248, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, is in order.<br><br>This brings us now to the imposable penalty. The trial court appreciated the aggravating circumstance that appellant employed means to weaken the defense and accordingly sentenced him to death.<br><br>The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure requires, however, that every complaint or information should state not only the qualifying but also the aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In the case at bar, the information did not specifically allege that appellant employed means to weaken the defense nor show how the act which resulted in the death of the victim was committed. The said aggravating circumstance cannot thus be appreciated.<br><br>The penalty for the crime of Murder for which appellant is liable is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. As there is neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance in the case at bar, the lesser penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> should be applied conformably with Article 63, paragraph 2, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>As for damages, while the heirs of the victim are entitled to moral damages without need of proof in line with the policy of the Court to award the same in case of violent death,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> consistent with current case law, the award by the trial court of P100,000.00 should be reduced to P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>With respect to actual damages sustained by the heirs of the victim, the same may only be awarded if duly supported by receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Since only the funeral expenses of P28,000.00, less the admitted reimbursement by the SSS of P10,000.00, and the autopsy expenses of P3,000.00 are duly supported by receipts, the award of P21,500.00 must be reduced to P21,000.00. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed Decision is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION.</b> Appellant Gerrymel Estillore y Postico is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of murder and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with accompanying accessory penalty therefor.
