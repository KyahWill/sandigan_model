				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review is the decision rendered by Branch 25 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City finding accused-appellant Carlos Lilo guilty of incestuous rape on four counts and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death on one count and <i>reclusion perpetua</i> on three.<br><br>By the account of private complainant, Carol Lilo, the only child of accused-appellant, she was raped numerous times by him but could recall only four occasions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> those subject of the criminal complaint docketed as Criminal Case No. 49823 and three separate informations docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 49824, 49825 and 49826 filed on September 3, 1998 at the RTC of Iloilo City, for acts allegedly committed in October 1995, May 24, 1998, July 24, 1998, and May 19, 1998, respectively, as follows:<br><blockquote> <center>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 49823<br></center><br>That in October 1995, in the Municipality of Calinog, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a bolo, with deliberate intent, by means of force and intimidation and with abuse of confidence and trust, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the undersigned complainant CAROL LILO, his daughter, who was then seventeen (17) years old, against her will and/or consent.<br><br><center>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 49824<br></center><br>That on or about May 24, 1998, in the Municipality of Calinog, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a bladed weapon, with deliberate intent, by means of force and intimidation and with abuse of confidence and trust, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of his daughter CAROL LILO, against her will and/or consent.<br><br><center>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 49825<br></center><br>That on or about July 24, 1998, in the Municipality of Calinog, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a bladed weapon, with deliberate intent, by means of force and intimidation and with abuse of confidence and trust, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of his daughter CAROL LILO, against her will and/or consent.<br><br><center>CRIMINAL CASE NO. 49826<br></center><br>That on or about May 19, 1998, in the Municipality of Calinog, Province of Iloilo, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a bladed weapon, with deliberate intent, by means of force and intimidation and with abuse of confidence and trust, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of his daughter CAROL LILO, against her will and/or consent.<br></blockquote>Recalling the rape which occurred on <b>a day in October 1995</b> subject of Criminal Case No. 49823, Carol declared as follows:<br><br>After accused-appellant left for his farm in Barangay Impalidan, Calinog, Iloilo, a kilometer away from his house,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> she followed him, bringing him food.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>After accused-appellant had eaten at around 10:30 a.m., he summoned her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> As she obliged, he held her, pointed a bolo at her and told her not to make any noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> She was thus prompted to ask him what he intended to do, he being her father, to which he replied: “You are my daughter and I was the one who caused you to be born. I was the one feeding you, clothing you. Afterwards others will make use of you? I will do it first.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant thereupon dragged her toward the sugarcane field some thirty meters from the farm and upon reaching it, he hugged her thighs and laid her on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She resisted and fought back, but he punched her, and she proved no match for him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant then removed her panty, raised her shirt, felt her whole body and kissed her lips and breasts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thereafter, he undressed himself, laid flat on her, and forced his penis into her vagina where it stayed for one (1) minute, he “mov[ing] his buttocks up and down,” drawing her to cry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> When he was through, accused-appellant cautioned her not to tell anybody what happened, otherwise he would kill her, her mother, and her grandmother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>A certification from the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of Calinog, Iloilo shows that Carol was only 17 years and 4 months old at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>With respect to the <b>May 19, 1998</b> incident subject of Criminal Case No. 49826, Carol related that while she was at home sleeping, accused-appellant woke her up, pointed a bolo at her and threatened her not to make any noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> While holding the bolo in one hand, accused-appellant undressed her, touched her body, kissed her on the lips and breasts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and “did to [her what] he did to [her] in the past.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The sexual act was repeated in the same manner, so Carol claimed, on <b>May 24, 1998</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> when at around midnight while she was at home, accused-appellant did to her the, “same thing he had done to [her] before.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Finally, on the <b>July 24, 1998</b> incident, Carol declared that as she lay asleep at 10:30 p.m., after a long night at a school function, accused-appellant woke her up, pointed a bolo at her and threatened her not to make any noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He then “undressed [her] and d[id] what he [had] done to [her] again.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>When asked why she never reported the incidents to her mother, Carol responded that her mother seldom went home on account of her work in “town” and that she was under constant threat from accused-appellant not to disclose the incidents to anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In August 1998, following her attendance in a symposium on abuses committed against children and women held at the Calinog Agricultural and Industrial College where she was enrolled, Carol, then already 20, revealed to her friend Joy Lyn Casalan about accused-appellant’s molestations on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Accompanied by Joy, she, on August 12, 1998, reported to the local police station the multiple rapes committed against her, and on the instruction of the police, she on even date submitted herself to medical examination which showed that she had 3 healed lacerations in the hymen located at 4, 6 and 8 o’clock positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant denied the accusations against him.<br><br>The trial court, however, discredited accused-appellant’s denial and found him guilty of four counts of rape in the decision on review, the dispositive portion of which reads: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the court, finding the accused, Carlos Lilo, guilty of four (4) counts of rape beyond reasonable doubt, imposes upon him the following penalties:<br><br>In each of the cases docketed as Crim. Cases Nos. 49824, 49825 and 49826, the penalty of reclusion perpetua with the accessory penalties as provided in Article 42 of the Revised Penal Code;<br><br>In Crim. Case No. 49823 the penalty of death with such accessory penalties as provided in Article 40 of the Revised Penal Code; and<br><br>To pay private complainant P50,000.00 as moral damages as well as pay the cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>Before this Court, accused-appellant disputes the finding that he is guilty beyond reasonable doubt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and assails the reliance by the trial court on the testimony of Carol who was merely motivated, so he claims, by resentment in filing the complaint due to the fact that he often maltreated her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant’s submission does not persuade. This Court finds his claim to be a mere afterthought for, during the trial, when asked if he knew of any motive why Carol filed the cases against him, he replied in the negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Further, this Court has consistently echoed its ruling that parental punishment would not suffice to egg one to falsely charge one’s father with rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant goes on to harp on Carol’s inability to recall the exact date when the incident in October 1995 was allegedly committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Failure to recall the exact date of the crime, however, is not an indication of false testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> for even discrepancies regarding exact dates of rapes are inconsequential and immaterial and cannot discredit the credibility of the victim as a witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant goes further to posit that rape could not have been committed in October 1995 in broad daylight, particularly in a farm where there were other people who were supposed to be at work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Judicial notice, however, is taken of the fact, and it can be considered of public knowledge, that the scene of rape is not always or necessarily isolated or secluded,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> as it can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks along the roadside, in school premises, in a house where there are other occupants, in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping, and even in places which to many would appear unlikely and high-risk venues for its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Finally, accused-appellant focuses on Carol’s behavior after the alleged rape incidents as running counter to human nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He cites Carol’s casually leaving the place where she claims to have been molested in October 1995 and continuing to work in the farm with him as if nothing happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The behavior or reaction of every person to a certain event cannot, however, be predicted with accuracy, and may be dealt with in any way by the victim whose testimony may be given full credence so long as her credibility is not tainted by any modicum of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The undoubted credibility of the witness in Carol and of her testimony notwithstanding, this Court finds that the prosecution has proven only one (1) count of rape, that committed in <b>October 1995</b>. The following testimony of Carol instructs so:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q-</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">And for how long did your father have sexual intercourse with you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">For almost three (3) minutes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q-</td> <td> <div align="justify">And after that what happened? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">After putting my clothes again he was frightening me not to tell anybody.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">COURT:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q-</td> <td> <div align="justify"><b>Was your father able to put his sex organ into yours</b>?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify"><b>Yes, your honor.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>).</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>With respect to the alleged incident of <b>May 19, 1998</b>, the following tale of Carol, quoted <i>verbatim</i>, does not establish the commission of rape.<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">PROS.

It bears emphasis that every charge of rape is a distinct and separate crime and each must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>With respect then to the incident of <b>May 19, 1998</b>, in the absence of any evidence showing that, aside from accused-appellant’s undressing and touching the delicate parts of Carol’s body, he had carnal knowledge with her, the crime committed is merely acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code which reads:<br><blockquote> ART. 336. <i>Acts of lasciviousness </i>- Any person who shall commit any act of lasciviousness upon other persons of either sex, under any of the circumstances mentioned in the preceding article, shall be punished by <i>prision correccional</i>.<br></blockquote>As in the May 19, 1998 incident, Carol’s following testimony regarding the <b>July 24, 1998</b> incident, quoted <i>verbatim</i>, does not establish the commission of rape:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q-</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">After May 19, 1998, were you <b>raped</b> again?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, your honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q-</td> <td> <div align="justify">What date was that? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">July 1998.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q-</td> <td> <div align="justify">What date in July 1998? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">July 24, 1998, your honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q- </td> <td><div align="justify">Where did it happen? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">At home.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center">xxx</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q-</td> <td> <div align="justify">So, you were there in your house when you were <b>raped</b> by your father on July 24, 1998? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, your honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="center">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q- <b></b></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>And what actually happened?</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A-</td> <td> <div align="justify">At about 10:30 while I was asleep I was awakened and when I woke up <b>he was pointing a knife at me and he told me do not make any noise and something bad will happen</b> to you.

Nor is there any showing of lewd designs for the acts to be considered as lascivious. The testimony, however, shows that accused-appellant, by means of threats, successfully undressed Carol against her will, facts that constitute the elements of grave coercion as defined in Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The elements of grave coercion were not, however, sufficiently alleged in the information under Criminal Case No. 49825 and, in view of the right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> accused-appellant may not be convicted of grave coercion.<br><br>Lastly, with respect to the rape allegedly committed on <b>May 24, 1998</b> subject of Criminal Case No. 49824, Carol had this to say:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">PROS.

Since the prosecution has failed to prove that any crime was committed on <b>May 24, 1998</b>, accused-appellant’s acquittal in Criminal Case No. 49824 is in order.<br><br>Having found that accused-appellant committed rape in Criminal Case No. 49823, and acts of lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. 49826, a determination of the penalties therefor is in order.<br><br>With respect to Criminal Case No. 49823, the May 27, 1997 Certification of the Calinog, Iloilo Civil Registrar<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> which therein quotes entries on the “facts of birth appear[ing] in our Registry of Birth” shows that Carol was born on June 1, 1978 to Carlos Lilo (accused-appellant) and Rosa Paloma. Unquestionably then, Carol is the daughter of accused-appellant, and was under eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the rape in October 1995. Since the crime was committed in October 1995, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 7659 (effective December 31, 1993),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> thus applies. It provides:<br><blockquote> Article 335. When and how rape is committed. - Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>The <b>death penalty</b> shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following, attendant circumstances:<br><ol><li>When the victim is <b>under eighteen (18) years of age</b> and the <b>offender is a parent</b>, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim;<br></li></ol><center>x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></center></blockquote>Hence, accused-appellant must be penalized with death.<br><br>Three justices of the Court, however, continue to maintain the unconstitutionality of R.A. 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty. Nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar.<br><br>With respect to Criminal Case No. 49826, relationship aggravated the commission of the acts of lasciviousness. As held in <i>People v.
