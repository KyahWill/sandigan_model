				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 6, of Baguio City, in Criminal Case No. 16420-R, finding appellant Roger Ospig guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br>The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> against appellant reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 19<sup>th</sup> day of October, 1998, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design  and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of GAZELLE SALAZAR, a minor who is 13 years of age, against her will and consent.<br></blockquote>When arraigned on April 19, 1999, appellant pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Trial ensued.<br><br><center><i>The Prosecution's Evidence</i></center><br>Private complainant Gazelle Salazar (Gazelle) is the 13-year-old daughter of Elizabeth Salazar (Elizabeth).  Elizabeth is the common-law wife of Alejandro Salazar, who is working in Saudi Arabia. Aside from Gazelle, Elizabeth has three other children, namely, Gladys, Alejandro  (J.R.) and Harold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Appellant Roger Ospig was the boyfriend of Elizabeth.  In 1998, they lived together, without the benefit of marriage, at the boarding house of Elizabeth at Tam-awan, Quezon Hill, Baguio City. Elizabeth's children were not aware of their relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The house of Elizabeth comprised of a living room and kitchen and one bedroom.  The living room and bedroom were divided by a wooden wall, and the door was covered with a curtain.  The children slept in the bedroom, which had two beds: one for the two boys and the other for the two girls. Appellant slept on a chair or a foam in the living room. Elizabeth slept with the children, particularly on the bed of the boys. When appellant was around and the children were still awake, Elizabeth would sleep in their room. After the children were asleep, Elizabeth would transfer to the living room and sleep with appellant.  They had sexual intercourse  only in the living room, unseen by  the children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>When appellant stayed with Elizabeth and her children, he helped wash the dishes and the clothes, he took care of the children and cooked for them. He also  helped Gazelle and Gladys in their studies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At that time, Elizabeth was working as a production worker at the Bay-Sport Manufacturing Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> at the Export Processing Zone in Loakan, Baguio City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On October 18, 1998, Elizabeth worked on night shift, that is, from 7:00 p.m. of October 18 to 7:00 a.m. of the next day, October 19, as evidenced by her daily time record<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9] </sup> and certificate of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Gazelle testified that in the early morning of October 19, 1998, when her mother was still at work, she woke up and saw appellant beside her. Appellant kissed her and her nipples, and inserted his finger in her vagina. He had already removed her underwear. Gazelle resisted by turning around and lying down on her front.  Appellant went out to the sala. Gazelle put back her underwear and went to sleep.  Thereafter, appellant went back inside Gazelle's room and removed her shorts and underwear. Gazelle was not able to resist because appellant pinned her down with his hands. She did not shout because she was scared as he told her that he would kill her and her brothers and sister if she would shout.  Appellant went on top of her, parted her legs and inserted his penis in her vagina and made an up and down movement. She felt pain.  She kicked him as hard as she could. He got off her and went to the living room.  She put on her shorts and underwear and went  back to sleep. She told her 9-year-old sister, Gladys, about the incident. She did not inform her mother because every time they would approach her, appellant was around with a menacing look.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On December 24, 1998, appellant left the house of Elizabeth  because her common-law husband, Alejandro, was expected to arrive the next day, December 25. Alejandro stayed in the Philippines until January 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On February 10, 1999, Gladys went home at lunchtime and told Elizabeth about the incident which Gazelle confided in her. Thereafter, Elizabeth fetched Gazelle in school. They went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Gazelle executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> at the police station.<br><br>On February 15, 1999, upon referral by the Chief of the Women and Children Desk Section of the Baguio City Police Office, Dr. Vladimir V. Villasenor, regional  chief of the PNP Crime Laboratory Service, Cordillera, examined Gazelle. He found that Gazelle's vagina exhibited deep healed lacerations at the 5:00 o' clock and 8:00 o'clock positions, and her labia majora was already gaping. According to Dr. Villasenor, the lacerations and gaping labia majora could have been caused by the insertion of a foreign object like a fully erect male genital organ. He also testified that the deep healed lacerations were compatible with the reported rape on or about October 19, 1998. Dr. Villasenor concluded that Gazelle was no longer a virgin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He prepared a Medico-legal Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup> with the following findings:<br><blockquote><center>xxx                xxx                   xxx</center><br><u>General &amp; Extra-genital:</u><br><br>Fairly nourished, fairly developed, coherent female child.  Breast are conical with light brown areola and nipples from which no secretion could be pressed out.  Abdomen is flat and tight.<br><br><u>Genital:</u><br><br>There is lanugo-type growth of pubic hair.  Labia majora are full convex and gaping with the dark brown labia minora presenting in between.  On separating the same, is disclosed an elastic and fleshy-type hymen with deep healed lacerations at 5 &amp; 8 o' clock positions.  External vaginal orifice offers moderate resistance to the introduction of the examining index finger and the virgin-size vaginal speculum. Vaginal canal is narrow with prominent rugosities. Cervix is normal in size, color &amp; consistency.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Subject is in non-virgin state physically.<br><br>There are no external signs of recent application of physical violence.<br><br>REMARKS:<br><br>Peri-urethral and vaginal smears are negative for gram (-) diplococci and for spermatozoa. x x x.<br></blockquote>During the trial, appellant wrote Elizabeth a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated August 20, 1999, which he handed to her in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In said letter, appellant explained what happened the night he and Elizabeth had an argument. He claimed that after their argument, he went home, drunk, and mistook Gazelle for Elizabeth as it was dark, and he embraced and kissed her. He, however, denied that he raped Gazelle. He asked for forgiveness.<br><br><center><i>The Defense's Evidence</i></center><br>Appellant Roger Ospig, 23 years old, single, a resident of Irisan, Baguio City, testified that beginning January 1998, he stayed in the residence of Elizabeth Salazar at Tam-awan, Baguio City, as her lover.  Elizabeth told him that she was already separated from her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant declared that on October 18, 1998, he was in the boarding house of Elizabeth the whole day. Elizabeth was scheduled to work from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. the next day. When she was preparing to go to work, he asked her why she always arrived home late in the morning and told her that maybe she already found someone to replace him. Elizabeth got mad and shouted at him. She kept on shouting at him, so he left the house to avoid her. He drank with one Danny at the billiard hall. They stopped drinking between 10 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., and he went home, drunk. He knocked at the door of the boarding house, but nobody answered. When he leaned on the door, it suddenly opened.  He entered the house and switched on the light, but there was no electricity.  He went straight to the bedroom and lay down on the bed of Harold.  He embraced a person lying there, thinking that she was Elizabeth.  He kissed her and inserted his hand inside her underwear.  He was surprised that he did not feel any pubic hair. When he was about to remove his hand,  he felt a strong kick. It was Gazelle who kicked him. He fell down from the bed and Gazelle was spitting.  He went out and washed his face, then slept in the sala.  He did not inform Elizabeth about the incident. He stayed at Elizabeth's house until December 24, 1998 because Elizabeth's husband was expected to arrive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [20]</sup><br><br>Appellant was served a warrant of arrest when he was at his residence in Irisan, Baguio City.  He voluntarily went with the person who served said warrant of arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>He admitted that he personally handed a letter to Elizabeth in court. He was asked why he wrote a part of the letter, marked as Exhibit "I-6," which reads: "<i>Inamin ko na sa iyo ang pangyayari at kung mahatulan man ako ng death sentence ay wala akong magagawa. Patawarin ninyo na lang ako. Nagpapaliwanag lang ako. Hindi pa ito alam ng attorney ko kaya duda rin siya sa akin.</i>" Appellant explained that he wrote said part of the letter to tell them that he did not commit the rape. If he will be hanged, it will be in their conscience. He denied that he raped Gazelle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On January 12, 2000, the trial court rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Roger Ospig Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined and penalized under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of Republic Act 8353 as charged in the Information and hereby sentences him to the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i>; to indemnify the victim Gazelle Salazar the amount of P50,000.00; and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accused Roger Ospig being a detention prisoner is entitled to be credited 4/5 of his preventive imprisonment in accordance with Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code in the service of his sentence.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant raised this lone issue:<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE JUDGE COMMITTED ERRORS IN THE APPRECIATION OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND RENDER[ED] A DECISION CONTRARY TO LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><center><i>The Court's Ruling</i></center><br>Appellant contends that the trial court failed to appreciate the contents of the private complainant's diary dated October 18, 1998, which was partly written in coded symbols, wherein she stated that she was only nearly abused by appellant on the night her mother went to work and that the next day, appellant did not abuse her. Appellant claims that the diary would show that he did not commit the crime of consummated rape, but only acts of lasciviousness or attempted raped.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>The entry referred to by appellant in private complainant's diary,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which is dated October 18, 1998, and marked as Exhibit "F-1," reads:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%"> <br></td> <td width="45%">6:50 [p.m.]</td> <td width="45%"><div align="right">101898</div></td> <td width="5%"> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="2">Sunday</td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> <td> <br></td> </tr> <tr> <td> <br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">You know what now only that I know that Tikay is pregnant.

Thus he already realized by then that it was the young girl Gazelle and not the mother who was on the bed.  But the incident did not end there.  The accused went back after a few minutes when Gazelle fell asleep again. And this time he forced himself upon her and consummated sexual intercourse with her despite her resistance and struggle and kicking him.  There is no more excuse therefore of any mistaken identity.
