				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Forum shopping is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It is an act of malpractice for it trifles with the courts, abuses their processes, degrades the administration of justice and adds to the already congested court dockets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> What is critical is the vexation brought upon the courts and the litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same or related causes and grant the same or substantially the same reliefs and in the process creates the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues, regardless of whether the court in which one of the suits was brought has no jurisdiction over the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, we probe what is perceived to be a blatant demonstration of forum shopping, outrageous abuse of judicial process and gross disrespect for the authority of this Court.<br><br>For a flashback on the factual backdrop of this case:&nbsp; Five (5) civil actions involving the ownership of Lots Nos. 5763 and 5765 -New situated in Salawag, Dasmariñas, Cavite, were jointly tried by RTC-Br. 21, Imus, Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> One of the complaints was filed by respondent Paxton Development Corporation against petitioner Top Rate Construction and General Services, Inc., and against respondent Baikal Realty Corporation and the Register of Deeds of Cavite, for declaration of nullity of the Torrens Title for Lots Nos. 5763-A and 5763-B as part and parcel of Lot No. 5763, docketed as Civil Case No. 1124-95, with prayer for damages.&nbsp; TOP RATE was represented in this civil case by the <b>Gana Law Office through Attys.

For the first time, TOP RATE&nbsp; bared to this Court the existence of its <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 pending in the Court of Appeals which had allegedly superseded its <i>Petition for Review</i> filed with this Court as the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> was taken up by a Division of Five of the Court of Appeals composed of Associate Justices Portia Aliño-Hormachuelos, Mercedes Gozo-Dadole, Eriberto U. Rosario, Jr., with Associate Justices Teodoro P. Regino and Mariano C. del Castillo as additional members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari</i> prayed for the withdrawal of TOP RATE's petition for review without prejudice to its refiling in the future if warranted.<br><br>On 24 April 2002 this Court denied with finality TOP RATE's motion for reconsideration of the <i>Resolution</i> dated 30 January 2002, and noted without action its <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition</i> dated 2 April 2002.&nbsp; It also appears that the denial of the motions for extension of time to file petition for review separately filed by Baikal and Hi-Tone had become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on 22 April 2002 the Division of Five of the Court of Appeals resolved to defer action on the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 "until after the Supreme Court has acted on [Top Rate's] `Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On 31 May 2002, apparently in response to the above-mentioned <i>Resolution </i>of the Court of Appeals, TOP RATE filed with the appellate court a <i>Manifestation</i> informing the Division of Five that it may now proceed to resolve TOP RATE's <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 in light of the <i>Resolution </i>of the Supreme Court dated 24 April 2002 which "noted without action" its <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari</i> of 2 April 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The <i>Manifestation </i>was signed by TOP RATE's lawyer of record <b>Gana &amp; Manlangit Law Office through the same lawyers Luis Ma.

Hocson and its lawyer <b>Gana &amp; Manlangit Law Office through Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit</b>&nbsp; filed their <i>Compliance</i> asserting that they had no intention to commit the "abhorrent and detestable practice of forum shopping;" assuming that there was forum shopping, they did so neither willfully nor deliberately but solely to protect the interest of TOP RATE as shown by the filing of the <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari</i> dated 2 April 2002 as soon it was certain that their <i>Petition for Review on Certiorari </i>was premature; the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 filed with the Court of Appeals could have been denied as a prohibited second motion for reconsideration, and with such denial TOP RATE&nbsp; would have also lost its period to file an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to this Court; and, finally, neither <i>litis pendentia </i>nor<i> res judicata</i> would have arisen in the instant case since the Supreme Court may still review the pertinent decision or resolution of the Court of Appeals on their <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On 4 February 2003 TOP RATE filed a <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i> of our <i>Resolution</i> dated 9 December 2002, praying that its motion to recall entry of judgment be granted.<br><br>In the meantime, on 27 March 2003, the Court of Appeals promulgated a <i>Resolution</i> directing its Clerk of Court to "return the records of this case to the court of origin," without however making any ruling on what the "court of origin" would be executing as the final and executory decision, nor any statement on the status of PAXTON's <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i> of the <i>Amended Decision</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This <i>Resolution </i>seems to be a belated response to the <i>Letter of Transmittal</i> coming from the Judicial Records Office of this Court directing the Clerk of Court of the Court of Appeals to return the records of the instant case to the trial court.<br><br>On 3 April 2003 PAXTON filed a <i>Manifestation</i> informing this Court of the 27 March 2003 <i>Resolution</i> of the Court of Appeals purportedly setting aside its <i>Amended Decision</i> of 2 August 2002, although nothing in that <i>Resolution</i> validated PAXTON's submission.<br><br>On 6 May 2003 PAXTON filed another <i>Manifestation </i>with this Court alleging that TOP RATE moved for the issuance of a writ of execution with RTC-Br. 21 of Imus, Cavite, which was signed this time by a certain Atty. Carmelo M. Mendoza in behalf of TOP RATE.<br><br>On 16 June 2003 this Court issued a <i>Resolution </i>denying with finality TOP RATE's motion for reconsideration of the <i>Resolution</i> of 9 December 2002 which in turn denied petitioner's urgent motion to recall entry of judgment, and further requiring TOP RATE to comment on the twin <i>Manifestations</i> of PAXTON.<br><br>In its <i>Comment</i> dated 18 July 2003, TOP RATE asserted that nowhere was it stated in the 27 March 2003 <i>Resolution</i> of the Court of Appeals that the appellate court was invalidating its <i>Amended Decision</i> of 2 August 2002, and that since the filing of its <i>Petition for Review</i> with this Court was premature, the subsequent dismissal thereof did not set aside the <i>Amended Decision</i>, which allegedly stands as the decision to be executed by the trial court.<br><br>The issues to be resolved herein are: (a) whether Top Rate Construction and General Services, Inc., and its counsel <b>Gana &amp; Manlangit Law Office through Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit</b> are guilty of forum shopping, and whether such transgression is willful and deliberate; (b) whether <b>Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit</b> are administratively liable for violation of the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility</i>; and, (c) whether the <i>Amended Decision</i> of 2 August 2002 may be reversed and set aside in the instant proceedings for being void on its face.<br><br>We have no doubt that Top Rate Construction and General Services, Inc. and its lawyer <b>Gana &amp; Manlangit Law Office through Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit</b> are guilty of forum shopping.&nbsp; Although TOP RATE as principal party executed the several certifications of non-forum shopping, <b>Attys. Gana and Manlangit</b> cannot deny responsibility therefor since <b>Atty. Manlangit</b> notarized the certifications and both of them definitely knew the relevant case status after having invariably acted as counsel of TOP RATE before the trial court, the Court of Appeals and this Court.<br><br>Clearly, in seeking to reverse the 13 March 1998 <i>Joint Decision</i> of the trial court and the 21 May 2001 <i>Decision</i> of the appellate court and to perfect ownership of Lots 5763-A and 5763-B upon similar causes and the same reliefs, TOP RATE and its lawyers committed forum shopping when they resorted simultaneously to both this Court by means of their <i>Petition for Review on Certiorari</i> and the Court of Appeals through their <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001. This misdeed amounts to a wagering on the result of their twin devious strategies, and shows not only their lack of faith in this Court in its evenhanded administration of law but also their expression of disrespect if not ridicule for our judicial process and orderly procedure.<br><br>Furthermore, while TOP RATE and its counsel moved to withdraw their <i>Petition for Review</i> for whatever such maneuver was worth, they did so only after they had been rebuffed in this Court.&nbsp; In doing so, they themselves proved that their coordinated actions were carried out purposely to increase their chances of securing a favorable decision.&nbsp; As has been held, a party is said to have sought to improve his odds of obtaining a sympathetic decision or action where after an unfavorable decision has been rendered against him in any of the cases he has brought before the courts, he seeks to abandon the adverse proceeding and concentrate his attention on the remaining case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The instant case is similar to <i>E. Razon, Inc. v. Philippine Ports Authority</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In <i>E. Razon, Inc., </i>petitioners after filing a petition for certiorari with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order in the Supreme Court filed an hour later a similar petition before the Regional Trial Court and, having been assured of a favorable action by the latter court, then sought the withdrawal of the petition in this Court.&nbsp; Petitioners were found guilty of forum-shopping, the Court holding that "(t)he acts of petitioners constitute a clear case of forum-shopping, an act of malpractice that is proscribed and condemned as trifling with the courts and abusing their processes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>What aggravates the transgression perpetrated by TOP RATE and its lawyers is that they deceived the highest court of the land.&nbsp; In all the certificates of non-forum shopping they presented to this Court, they did not reveal the existence of their <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 which they claimed was still pending before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; They divulged this "secret" only after their motion for extension of time to file a petition for review and their <i>Petition for Review on Certiorari</i> were denied by this Court, and only after they had filed their motion for reconsideration of such denials.<br><br>If TOP RATE and its counsel genuinely believed that their recourse to this Court was "premature," why then did they still ask for a reconsideration of the <i>Resolutions</i> denying their motion for extension and <i>Petition for Review</i>?&nbsp; Evidently they were venturing on two (2) fronts, and presumably simply "awaiting" auspicious word or two on their <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> of 21 December 2001 before finally disclosing their "real intent."<br><br>Worse, in their attempt to extricate themselves from the prejudicial <i>Resolutions </i>of this Court, TOP RATE and its counsel had the temerity to ask for the withdrawal of their <i>Petition for Review</i>, again on the insolent assertion that their resort to this Court was "premature." For the record, it took them four (4) months from 21 December 2001 when they filed their <i>Manifestation and Motion </i>up to 3 April 2002 when they submitted their <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari</i>, to concoct the theory of "prematurity!"<br><br>To be sure, there is no merit in the claim that the <i>Petition for Review</i> initiated by TOP RATE and its lawyers was "premature." TOP RATE and its lawyers are estopped from claiming that this initiatory pleading was "premature" for it was their unwavering representation before this Court that the Court of Appeals had already rendered a final and appealable decision when they filed their motion for extension of time and ultimately their <i>Petition for Review</i>.&nbsp; The filing of such petition presupposes the finality of the judgment subject of appeal.<br><br>In any event, Sec. 15 of the <i>2002 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals</i> (which is a restatement of Sec. 8, Rule 9, of the old <i>Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals</i>) explicitly provides that "(n)o motion for reconsideration or rehearing shall be acted upon if the movant has previously filed in the Supreme Court a petition for review on certiorari or a motion for extension of time to file such petition. If such petition or motion is subsequently filed, the motion for reconsideration pending in this Court shall be deemed abandoned." Verily, although a motion for reconsideration is still before the Court of Appeals, the motion is deemed vacated once the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked.<br><br>The lawyers of TOP RATE are not excused from engaging in forum shopping for the reason that their client's interests were then paramount.&nbsp; On the contrary, this assertion coming as it does from their <i>Compliance </i>of 25 January 2003 in reply to our show cause order, very well confirms the identical causes and their reliefs of their <i>Petition for Review on Certiorari</i> and <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 as both were calculated to quash the adverse decisions of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>It bears stressing that a lawyer truly worth his oath pledges allegiance not only to his clients but also to society, the legal profession and the courts, for the client's cause is not all encompassing nor perpetually overriding.&nbsp; Moreover, if their purpose in filing the <i>Petition for Review</i> even while the <i>Manifestation and Motion </i>was pending with the Court of Appeals is to protect some entitlements of TOP RATE, are they implying that the Supreme Court is incapable of defending such asserted right?&nbsp; But the court <i>a quo</i> can?&nbsp; We certainly cannot unfold our compassionate mantle in this instance, and instead, we must lay our disciplinary hand to strike down the reprehensible ploy employed by TOP RATE and <b>Attys. Gana and Manlangit</b>.<br><br>TOP RATE and its lawyers cannot rectify their forum shopping by arguing that <i>litis pendentia </i>and <i>res judicata</i> would not have arisen in the instant case since the Supreme Court may still review the pertinent decision or resolution of the Court of Appeals on their <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001.<br><br>This argument is patently misplaced.&nbsp; For precisely, the concurrent pleadings of TOP RATE and its lawyers exhibit the element of <i>litis pendentia</i> and <i>res judicata </i>alleged by them to be absent, i.e., the result of the first action is determinative of the second action in any event and regardless of which party is successful, since the action of this Court on the <i>Petition for Review</i> will surely bind the other pending action on the same cause in the court <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; Moreover, how can this Court still resolve on appeal such "subsequent" decision when it has already decided with finality the same cause upon which the "later" decision was supposedly based?&nbsp; The purported review by this Court of the "ensuing" decision would have been barred by <i>res judicata</i>.&nbsp; Incidentally, in <i>Crisostomo v. Securities and Exchange Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> where forum shopping was detected, the infringing cases were filed with the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.<br><br>We also rule that the forum shopping pulled off by TOP RATE and its lawyers is willful and deliberate. As reflected in the "Secretary's Certificate" authorizing the President of TOP RATE to file the necessary pleadings in court to question the adverse decisions of the Court of Appeals, <b>Atty. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana</b> as TOP RATE Corporate Secretary attested to the collective desire to file the <i>Petition for Review</i> even while the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> of 21 December 2001 was still pending with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In addition, the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> filed with the Court of Appeals which prayed for the same reliefs as the <i>Petition for Review </i>before this Court was deemed filed as early as 21 December 2001, yet its existence was disclosed to this Court only on 3 April 2002 when TOP RATE and its lawyers submitted their <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari</i>.&nbsp; What is more, this underhanded sense of honesty was triggered only after the adverse <i>Resolutions</i> of this Court were promulgated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to this confession, TOP RATE as abetted by its lawyers executed certificates of non-forum shopping in its motion for extension of time to file petition for review and its <i>Petition for Review</i> itself, which contained no reference to the filing or pendency of the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> filed with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, even as TOP RATE moved to reconsider the denial of its motion for time and <i>Petition for Review</i>, there was no mention whatsoever of its existence.<br><br>We also keenly observe how <b>Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit</b> instigated the Court of Appeals to rule on their <i>Manifestation and Motion </i>of 21 December 2001, thereby consummate and realize the fruits of their forum shopping, when they nonchalantly alleged in one of their <i>Manifestations</i> before the Court of Appeals that the appellate court may already proceed to resolve TOP RATE's <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> despite their knowledge that their <i>Petition for Review</i> had been denied with finality and that their motion to withdraw such petition was not granted.<br><br>Obviously, under the foregoing state of facts, forum shopping was crafted willfully and deliberately with the sole objective of endorsing whichever proceeding would yield favorable consequences to TOP RATE's interests.<br><br>On the second issue, we hold that <b>Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit of the Gana and Manlangit Law Office</b>, counsel of record of TOP RATE, are administratively liable for grotesque violations of the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In arriving at this conclusion, we strongly note how <b>Attys. Luis Ma. Gil L. Gana and Elmer E. Manlangit</b> prompted the Court of Appeals to rule on their <i>Manifestation and Motion </i>of 21 December 2001 and thereby complete the process of forum shopping, despite their knowledge that their <i>Petition for Review</i> had been denied with finality and that their motion to withdraw such petition was not granted.<br><br>Under Sec. 5, Rule 7, of the <i>1997 Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, willful and deliberate forum shopping constitutes direct contempt of court and a cause for administrative sanctions, which may both be resolved and imposed in the same case where the forum shopping is found.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The lawyers of record of TOP RATE, as all other lawyers, should be reminded that their primary duty is to assist the courts in the administration of justice.&nbsp; Any conduct which tends to delay, impede or obstruct the administration thereof contravenes their oath of office.<br><br>"A lawyer shall uphold the <i>Constitution</i>, obey the laws of the land, promote respect for law and legal processes;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening the confidence in the legal system;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> shall observe the rules of procedure and not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> shall not file multiple actions arising from the same cause;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> shall impress upon his client compliance with the laws and the principles of fairness;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> shall represent his client with zeal within the bounds of the law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and, shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client x x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>This Court has time and again warned counsel of litigants not to abuse court processes, especially not to resort to forum shopping for this practice clogs the court dockets.

Gana and Manlangit</b> from the practice of law for six (6) months from finality of this <i>Resolution </i>should make them realize the seriousness of the consequences and implications of their abuse of judicial process and disrespect for judicial authority.<br><br>Finally, on the third issue, this Court has no choice but to reverse and set aside the <i>Amended Decision</i> of the Court of Appeals promulgated on 2 August 2002 for being void on its face.&nbsp; To be sure, the instant proceeding is a collateral attack on such decision since the issue of its validity is involved in this action only as a mere incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Of course, this attack is proper only when the assailed judgment is null on its face, as where it is patent that the court which rendered the judgment in question has no jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Parenthetically, forum shopping is consummated although the court in which one of the suits was brought has no jurisdiction over the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In <i>Macabingkil v.

If such petition or motion is subsequently filed, the motion for reconsideration pending in this Court shall be deemed abandoned." As the jurisdiction of this Court had been summoned, it was too late in the day for the appellate court to act upon the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> and enter a new decision on the merits.<br><br>Our ruling in <i>Joy Mart Consolidated Corp. v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> is instructive.&nbsp; In that case, the trial court granted plaintiff a writ of preliminary injunction against defendants, which the latter challenged before the Court of Appeals on petition for certiorari and prohibition with prayer for the immediate lifting thereof.&nbsp; While the certiorari petition to review the writ was still pending in the appellate court, defendants filed in the trial court a joint petition to dissolve the writ, offering to post a counterbond for that purpose.&nbsp; As prayed for, the trial court dissolved the writ and denied plaintiff's motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the Court of Appeals upon being apprised of the trial court's action dismissed the petition for certiorari for having become moot and academic.<br><br>The issue in <i>Joy Mart Consolidated Corp. </i>was whether the trial court continued to have control of the writ of preliminary injunction even after the same had been raised to the Court of Appeals for review.&nbsp; This Court ineluctably ruled -<br><blockquote> The answer is no.&nbsp; After the LRTA and Phoenix had elevated the writ of preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals for determination of the propriety of its issuance x x x the trial court (notwithstanding the absence of a temporary restraining order from the appellate court) could not interfere with or preempt the action or decision of the Court of Appeals on the writ x x x whose annulment was sought therein by Phoenix and the LRTA.&nbsp; In petitioning the trial court to lift the writ x x x Phoenix and the LRTA engaged in forum-shopping.&nbsp; After the question of whether the writ x x x should be annulled or continued had been elevated to the Court of Appeals for determination, the trial court lost jurisdiction or authority to act on the same matter x x x x They improperly tried to moot their own petition in the Court of Appeals - a clear case of trifling with the proceedings in the appellate court or of disrespect for said court x x x x Judicial courtesy behooved the trial court to keep its hands off the writ x x x and defer to the better judgment of the Court of Appeals the determination of whether the writ should be continued or discontinued x x x x The private respondents' application to the trial court for the dissolution of the writ x x x that was pending review in the Court of Appeals was a form of forum shopping which this Court views with extreme disapproval.&nbsp; The lower court's proceeding being void for lack of jurisdiction, the writ of preliminary injunction should be reinstated, and the petition to annul the writ x x x should be dismissed on the ground of forum shopping x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote>The absence of jurisdiction on the part of the court <i>a quo</i> is manifest not only from the voluminous <i>rollo</i> compiled by the Court of Appeals but also from the four corners of the <i>Amended Decision</i>.&nbsp; From the case record, we will find copies of TOP RATE's motion for extension of time to file petition for review, its <i>Petition for Review</i>, the adverse <i>Resolutions </i>of this Court denying the motion for extension of time to file petition for review and the <i>Petition for Review</i> itself.&nbsp; The case record also informs us of the denial with finality of TOP RATE's motion for reconsideration of the unfavorable <i>Resolutions</i> of this Court as well as the noting without action of its <i>Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition</i> dated 2 April 2002.&nbsp; From these circumstances alone, we can clearly infer lack of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to promulgate the <i>Amended Decision</i>.<br><br>Moreover, in the 22 April 2002 <i>Resolution </i>of the Division of Five, action on the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> dated 21 December 2001 was deferred "until after the Supreme Court has acted on [Top Rate's] `Manifestation and Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This implies that the appellate court was well-aware that TOP RATE had summoned the authority of this Court.&nbsp; Finally, in the <i>Dissenting Opinion</i> which forms an integral part of the <i>Amended Decision</i>, there are unmistakable references to the <i>Petition for Review </i>which was filed with this Court while the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> was still pending in the Court of Appeals –<br><blockquote> On April 24, 2002 this Court deferred action on appellant TOP RATE's Manifestation and Motion dated December 21, 2001 x x x due to the pendency in the Supreme Court of TOP RATE's Motion to Withdraw the Petition for Review on Certiorari it earlier filed therein x x x x On June 7, 2002 this Division received a copy of the Supreme Court's Resolution dismissing with finality TOP RATE's Motion for Reconsideration of its Resolution dismissing TOP RATE's Petition for Review x x x x<br></blockquote>Undoubtedly, we can nullify the <i>Amended Decision</i> in the instant case since the dearth of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to rule upon the <i>Manifestation and Motion</i> can be plainly discerned not only from the case record but also from the text of the assailed decision itself.<br><br>WHEREFORE, we Resolve to (a) <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET</b> ASIDE the <i>Amended Decision</i> of 2 August 2002 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
