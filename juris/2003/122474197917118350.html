In the benefit dance was his son Crisanto Balisacan, who attended the dance with his friends.&nbsp; Crisanto stood beside the emcee, Ceasario Escarlos, appellant's brother.&nbsp; While Ceasario was calling the victim, Antonio Balisacan, to come to the the stage as he was a <i>kagawad</i>, Crisanto heard the people at his back shout `Ay!'.&nbsp; Five (5) to six (6) meters at his back, with the place [illuminated] by a 50 to 100 watts bulb, he saw appellant stab his father, Antonio, several times. Crisanto was momentarily shocked that he was not able to react.&nbsp; When appellant fled, Crisanto came to his senses and ran to Antonio.&nbsp; Antonio was still alive so he brought him to Urdaneta Sacred Heart Hospital where he expired a few minutes after arrival.<br><br>"Jesus Dismaya was also beside Ceasario when Antonio Balisacan's name was called.&nbsp; When he heard people shout, he turned around and saw from a distance of four (4) meters appellant stabbing Antonio four (4) times with a ten (10) inch-long knife.&nbsp; He then called Antonio's brother, [Marcelo] Balisacan.<br><br>"Within the vicinity was Antonio's brother, Marcelo Balisacan.&nbsp; He was in the Asingan-Urdaneta road, which was about fifteen (15) meters outside Ulep's yard when he heard people shout and run from the benefit dance.&nbsp; Wanting to know what was happening, he went to the benefit dance and saw that Antonio was stabbed.&nbsp; He went near Antonio, hugged him, and asked who stabbed him. He replied, `Tomy Escarlos.'<br><br>"Meanwhile around 9:30 of the same evening of July 1, 2000. SPO1 Patricio Badua was on duty.&nbsp; He received a phone call about a stabbing incident in a benefit dance in Domampot, Asingan, Pangasinan.&nbsp; When he went to the scene of the crime, the victim, Antonio Balisacan was already in the hospital and appellant had already fled.&nbsp; He later learn[ed] that Antonio died.<br><br>"Dr. Noemi Taganas conducted an autopsy on Antonio's body and found:<br><br>External Findings: <blockquote> <ol> <li>Stab wound located below the right clavicle measuring 3 inches length (in) and 8 inches (in) depth.<br></li><li>Stab wound located at left armpit measuring 4 inches length and 6 inches depth.<br></li><li>Stab wound located at mid lumbar area measuring 3 inches length and 4 inches depth<br></li><li>Stab wound located between right first and second finger measuring 3 inches length. </li></ol></blockquote> Internal Findings: <blockquote> <ol> <li>Cutting of the upper and lower lobe of the right lung.<br></li><li>Cutting of the lower lobe of the left lung. </li></ol></blockquote> "She later issued a death certificate.&nbsp; She stated in court that out of the four (4) stab wounds, Antonio's second stab wound was fatal because the lungs were penetrated.<br><br>"Dr. Ronald Bandonil, an NBI medico-legal officer confirmed Taganas' autopsy report.&nbsp; He also conducted an autopsy on the exhumed body of Antonio. In his autopsy he found that Antonio's first and second wounds were fatal as these caused his death due to hypovalmic shock or massive blood loss."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><i><b>Version of the Defense</b></i></u><br></div><br>Appellant, on the other hand, relates his version of the facts in this manner:<br><blockquote> "On the night of July 1, 2000, accused TIMOTEO ESCARLOS together with Rexie Yabes, Fredo Ramos, Erwin Ramos, Rowena Alamigo and others were at the yard of Jaime Ulep, in Purok Inanama, Domanpot Asingan, Pangasinan watching a benefit dance sponsored by Mr. &amp; Mrs. Organization.&nbsp; He was invited to buy lechon during the benefit dance.<br><br>"While thereat, Kgd. Antonio Balisacan who was then drunk, passed in front of accused and told him, `You are here again to create trouble.'&nbsp; Accused was offended so he answered back saying `Why do you say that to me when I am not doing any trouble here.'&nbsp; Antonio Balisacan told him, `OKINNAM KETDI' (vulva of your Mother) and without warning boxed him.&nbsp; Timoteo was hit on the forehead, which left a scar on his forehead about an inch above the right eyebrow.&nbsp; He intended to box back but he noticed that the victim was pulling out a kitchen knife, so for fear of his life, he grabbed the weapon from Antonio Balisacan and used the knife in stabbing the latter who was hit at the side below the left armpit.&nbsp; He stabbed him twice and when the victim was about to fall down, he was able to hit him for the third time.<br><br>"The weapon that Timoteo was able to get from Antonio was a kitchen knife about 10 to 12 inches.&nbsp; Antonio drew the knife from his left side. Timoteo was able to get hold of the handle of the knife when he grappled for the same from the victim, by taking hold of the knife with his right hand and stabbed Antonio who was intending to stab him.&nbsp; Antonio was one (1) inch taller than accused.<br><br>"Timoteo's testimony was corroborated by an eyewitness, CESARIO ESCARLOS, the brother of Timoteo and president of the Mr. &amp; Mrs. Association which sponsored the benefit dance on July 1, 2000.<br><br>"On the night of July 1, 2000, Cesario Escarlos was at the yard of Jaime Ulep.&nbsp; At about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of the said date, he saw his brother Timoteo Escarlos together with Dexie Yabis standing in a corner watching the dance.&nbsp; Several minutes later Kgd. Antonio Balisacan arrived and later on, while Cesario was on his way to urinate. He heard Antonio uttered to Timoteo `ADDA CAYO MANEN NGA AGARAMED TI NILOLOCON.'&nbsp; While relieving himself, he heard both Timoteo and Antonio arguing and before he could get near and pacify them, he saw them wrestling with each other. Many people were around but nobody pacified them.&nbsp; Next minute he saw Antonio bloodied and lying on the ground.&nbsp; There were at least 100 people then and might have seen the incident.&nbsp; He noticed that Jesus Dismaya was there but the latter did not do anything. Cesario, after the incident only stayed there for 3 minutes because he was looking for his three year-old daughter. In the meantime, nobody touched the body of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u><br></div><br>The trial court believed that the prosecution's evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of murder qualified by treachery.&nbsp; It rejected his plea of self-defense, because there had been no unlawful aggression on the part of the victim.<br><blockquote> "x x x. The established facts revealed that the victim was one of the persons who filed a case of malicious mischief against [appellant].&nbsp; Said case was filed five (5) months before the instant case happened.&nbsp; To the mind of the Court, the accused only found a way of avenging what he felt towards the victim.&nbsp; He took advantage of that x x x particular time and place to let out his feelings in the presence of his barangay mates.&nbsp; Such hidden grudge by the accused against the victim, established the motive of the former.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The second element of self-defense is also lacking.&nbsp; The nature, location and the number of wounds inflicted on the victim belie and negate the accused[`s] claim of self-defense.&nbsp; The post mortem findings of the autopsy report showed that the victim sustained four stab wounds.<br><br>"If there is any truth to the accused'[s] claim of self-defense, he would not have stabbed him several times. [Worse,] the location of the wounds suggested that the accused was at the back of the victim when the wounds were inflicted.&nbsp; It is therefore evident from the conduct of the accused that he was determined to kill the victim and did not just act to defend himself.&nbsp; In view of the foregoing, it is no longer necessary to discuss the third element."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this automatic review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Appellant assigns the following alleged errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"1.</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The honorable trial court erred in appreciating treachery as a qualifying circumstance despite failure of the prosecution to prove its attendance.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"2. </td> <td><div align="justify">The honorable trial court erred in not finding that the testimony of the supposed eyewitnesses for the prosecution as to the attendance of treachery is flawed and unworthy of belief.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"3.</td> <td> <div align="justify">The honorable trial court erred in not giving exculpatory weight to the theory of self-defense interpose[d] by the accused-appellant.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"4.</td> <td> <div align="justify">The honorable trial court committed a grave and serious error in not finding that the victim [was] the first to assault accused.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"5.</td> <td> <div align="justify">The honorable trial court erred in considering motive to establish the guilt of the accused.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"6. </td> <td><div align="justify">The honorable court erred in convicting the accused-appellant of murder instead of acquitting him or at most convicting him of homicide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>These issues boil down to four: (1) sufficiency of the prosecution's evidence, (2) viability of self-defense, (3) appreciation of treachery as a qualifying circumstance, and (4) propriety of the penalty and the damages imposed by the trial court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>First Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Sufficiency of the Prosecution's Evidence</i></u></b><br></div><br>Although appellant did not directly raise the sufficiency of the prosecution's evidence as an issue, this Court nonetheless deliberated on it <i>motu proprio, </i>because an automatic appeal in a criminal action opens the whole case for review.&nbsp; Indeed, the strength of the prosecution's evidence must be passed upon, especially in cases in which the death penalty has been imposed by the trial court<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> We have carefully examined the evidence for the prosecution and found that the fact of killing and the identity of the killer were duly established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Prosecution Witness Crisanto Balisacan, son of the victim, testified on the stabbing incident, which had occurred during a benefit dance on that fateful night of July 1, 2000.

Appellant adds that he had initially thought of hitting back when he noticed that the victim was pulling out a kitchen knife.&nbsp; Hence, to save his life, the former grabbed the weapon and used it to stab the latter. Appellant insists that under the circumstances, he was legally justified in using the knife to ward off the unlawful aggression.&nbsp; For him to wait for the knife to be raised and to fall on him before acting to defend himself would be asking too much, he argues.<br><br>The contentions of appellant are untenable.&nbsp; While the victim may be said to have initiated the confrontation, we do not subscribe to the view that the former was subjected to an <i>unlawful aggression </i>within the legal meaning of the phrase.<br><br>The alleged assault did not come as a surprise, as it was preceded by a heated exchange of words between the two parties who had a history of animosity.&nbsp; Moreover, the alleged drawing of a knife by the victim could not have placed the life of appellant in imminent danger.&nbsp; The former might have done it only to threaten or intimidate the latter.<br><br>Unlawful aggression presupposes <i>actual, sudden, unexpected or imminent danger --</i> not merely threatening and intimidating action<i>.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><i> </i>Uncertain, premature and speculative was the assertion of appellant that the victim was about to stab him, when the latter had merely drawn out his knife. There is aggression, only when the one attacked faces real and immediate threat to one's life.&nbsp; The peril sought to be avoided must be imminent and actual, not just speculative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that there was an altercation before the stabbing incident and that some danger did in fact exist, the imminence of that danger had already ceased the moment appellant disarmed the victim by wresting the knife from the latter.&nbsp; After the former had successfully seized it, there was no longer any unlawful aggression to speak of that would have necessitated the need to kill the latter. Hence, appellant became the unlawful aggressor when he stabbed the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>When an unlawful aggression that has begun no longer exists, the one who resorts to self-defense has no right to kill or even to wound the former aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> To be sure, when the present victim no longer persisted in his purpose or action to the extent that the object of his attack was no longer in peril, there was no more unlawful aggression that would warrant legal self-defense on the part of appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Undoubtedly, the latter went beyond the call of self-preservation when he proceeded to inflict excessive, atrocious and fatal injuries on the latter, even when the allegedly unlawful aggression had already ceased.<br><br><u><b><i>Reasonable Necessity of the </i><br><i>Means Employed to Prevent </i><br><i>or Repel the Attack</i></b></u><br><br>Appellant argues that in the heat of the encounter, he was not in a position to calculate or determine the effects of his blows, and that it was nevertheless necessary for him to inflict them in order to save his own life.<br><br>As correctly held by the trial court, the nature, the number and the location of the wounds inflicted upon the victim were important indicia disproving self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The claim of appellant that only two of the four stab wounds were fatal is of no moment, inasmuch as the means he employed was glaringly disproportionate to the perceived unlawful aggression.&nbsp; He admitted in his testimony that he had stabbed the victim for the third time, even when the latter was about to fall.<br><br>The means employed by a person invoking self-defense must be reasonably commensurate to the nature and the extent of the attack sought to be averted, as held by the Court in <i>People v. Obordo</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote> "Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that there was unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, accused-appellant likewise failed to prove that the means he employed to repel Homer's punch was reasonable.&nbsp; The means employed by the person invoking self-defense contemplates a rational equivalence between the means of attack and the defense. Accused-appellant claimed that the victim punched him and was trying to get something from his waist, so he (accused-appellant) stabbed the victim with his hunting knife.&nbsp; His act of immediately stabbing Homer and inflicting a wound on a vital part of the victim's body was unreasonable and unnecessary considering that, as alleged by accused-appellant himself, the victim used his bare fist in throwing a punch at him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Indeed, the means employed by a person resorting to self-defense must be rationally necessary to prevent or repel an unlawful aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Unlawful aggression is a <i>conditio</i> <i>sine qua non</i> for upholding the justifying circumstance of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Unless the victim has committed unlawful aggression against the other, there can be no self-defense, <i>complete or incomplete</i>, on the part of the latter.

The existence of a struggle before the fatal blows were inflicted on the victim clearly shows that he was forewarned of the impending attack, and that he was afforded the opportunity to put up a defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Indeed, a killing done at the spur of the moment is not treacherous.&nbsp; Moreover, any doubt as to the existence of treachery must be resolved in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Cariño,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we modified the trial court's decision and ruled that the crime committed was only homicide, because the qualifying circumstance of treachery had not been clearly established.&nbsp; Thus, the Court declared:<br><blockquote> "However, we agree with the OSG's recommendation that appellant be held liable only for homicide, not murder. In this case, the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not conclusively established.&nbsp; For treachery to exist, the following requisites must be met: (1) that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) that the offender consciously adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him.&nbsp; The facts show that Edmundo was placed on guard concerning a possible assault by Pedro.&nbsp; First, there was a heated argument between them at the place of the wake.&nbsp; Second, Edmundo was not unaware that he and Rolando were followed outside by appellant, who did not adopt any means to conceal himself or hide his intention of confronting Edmundo.&nbsp; Third, the abrasions and contusions on Edmundo's face show that Edmundo was able to put up a fight before he was fatally stabbed. These circumstances negate the existence of treachery in the commission of the offense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>As in <i>People v.

Verily, the brutal killing was not the result of a previous plot or sinister design to end the life of the victim.<br><br>The elements of evident premeditation are as follows: (a) the time when the accused decided to commit the crime; (b) an overt act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to the determination to commit the crime; and (c) the lapse of a period of time, between the determination and the subsequent execution of the crime, sufficient to allow the accused an opportunity to reflect upon the consequences of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> As found by the trial court, the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence to establish any of the foregoing requisites.&nbsp; To be sure, when there is no showing how and when the plan to kill was decided or how much time had elapsed before the crime was carried out, there is no evident premeditation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In a criminal prosecution -- especially in cases involving the extreme penalty of death -- nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the accused is charged must be established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Fourth Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Proper Penalty and Award of Damages</i></u></b><br></div><br>Under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for homicide is <i>reclusion temporal</i>.&nbsp; There being neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstance, the appropriate penalty should be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.&nbsp; Appellant is likewise entitled to the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<br><br>The trial court awarded moral damages in the amount of P50,000, but failed to award P50,000 as civil indemnity for the death of the victim.&nbsp; Moral damages cannot be granted in the absence of proof therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Unlike in rape cases, this type of award is not automatically given in murder or homicide.&nbsp; The prosecution was, however, able to prove actual damages in the sum of P28,650.&nbsp; The award of exemplary damages should be omitted considering that no aggravating circumstance was duly proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision is <i><b>MODIFIED.</b></i> Appellant is held guilty of homicide and sentenced to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prison mayor</i> medium, as minimum; to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal </i>medium, as maximum.&nbsp; He shall also pay the heirs of the victim the amounts of P50,000 as civil indemnity and P28,650<b> </b>as actual damages, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The grant of moral and exemplary damages is <i><b>DELETED</b></i>.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Vitug, Quisumbing, Ynares-Santiago, Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales</i>, and <i>Callejo, Sr., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Puno, and Azcuna, JJ.</i>, on official business.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp.18-30.&nbsp; Penned by Judge Alicia B.
