				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated February 27, 1998, of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 30), Bambang, Nueva Vizcaya, finding appellants Nestor Carriaga, Cosme Carriaga and Ben Palis guilty of Murder, sentencing each of them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and to pay <i>in solidum</i> to the heirs of the deceased<i> </i>the amount of P49,713.75 as actual expenses, P50,000.00 as death indemnity, P50,000.00 for lost income and P100,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>On March 4, 1994, appellants Nestor Carriaga, Cosme Carriaga and Ben Palis were charged with Murder in an Information, docketed as Criminal Case No. 755, which reads:<br><blockquote> That on or about 2:30 P.M. of December 3, 1993, at Sitio Nabetangan, Barangay Canabay, Municipality of Dupax del Sur, Province of Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, by means of treachery and taking advantage of superior strength, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and hack Ernesto de Guzman, inflicting mortal wounds on the different parts of his body, causing his untimely death, to the damage and prejudice of his heirs.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Upon arraignment on May 6, 1994, all three appellants pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; Thereupon, trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented eight witnesses, namely: Lita de Guzman, Balbino<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> de Guzman, Ernesto de Guzman, Jr., SPO4 Johnny Baguidudol,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> SPO1 Saulo Fontanilla, SPO4 Alfredo Dotimas and Dr. Pepito Balgos.&nbsp;&nbsp; SPO4 Alfonso dela Cruz testified as rebuttal witness for the prosecution.<br><br>The facts established by the prosecution are as follows:<br><br>On December 1, 1993, at around 10:00 in the morning, victim Ernesto de Guzman, Sr. (Ernesto, for brevity) confided to his brother, Balbino de Guzman, that appellants Cosme and Nestor Carriaga were grabbing his (Ernesto's) land and that they threatened to kill him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Ernesto became the object of their ire since he started to improve the river as a source of livelihood.&nbsp; On one occasion, the appellants Carriaga brothers told Ernesto not to continue working the area or else something might happen to him and his family.&nbsp; Appellant Ben Palis accused Ernesto of informing the police that the Carriaga brothers owned guns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On December 3, 1993, at around 2:30 in the afternoon, Ernesto was sleeping in their house in Sitio Nabetangan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Brgy. Canabay, Dupax del Sur, Nueva Vizcaya.&nbsp; His wife Lita was washing the dishes and his twelve-year old son Ernesto, Jr. was listening to a radio program.&nbsp; Lita stopped washing the dishes when she sensed somebody enter the house.&nbsp; She then saw appellants Cosme and Nestor, each holding a <i>bolo</i>, and Palis, standing by the door, with both hands placed at his back.&nbsp; Lita shouted "<i>Apay</i>" (Why). Upon hearing the shout, Ernesto, Jr. peeped and saw the three appellants.&nbsp; Nestor and Cosme went directly to where Ernesto was sleeping and immediately began hacking him.&nbsp; Cosme first hacked Ernesto and hit him on the right leg.&nbsp; Lita tried to help her husband, but Nestor pushed her aside and attempted to hack her as well.&nbsp; She was able to evade the hacking and exited through the second door near the wash area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the meantime, Ernesto, Jr. saw Nestor go to his father and hack the latter's head, followed by Cosme who gave Ernesto another hack on the head.&nbsp; Still not content, Nestor hacked Ernesto at the back.&nbsp; Ernesto, Jr. became so scared that he jumped out of the window and scampered away.&nbsp; Lita who was running and crying for help, heard her son, saying "Inay, Inay, wait for me". Thus, she waited for him, after which, they both ran.&nbsp; They then heard a vehicle approaching.&nbsp; Thinking that the killers might have boarded the same, Lita and Ernesto, Jr. hid among the tall grasses.&nbsp; When they peeped, they saw the three appellants in the front seat of a blue passenger jeepney.&nbsp; After the vehicle passed, the two continued to run until they reached the <i>poblacion</i>.&nbsp; Lita instructed her son to go to his uncle and report what had happened.&nbsp; As told, Ernesto, Jr. informed his uncle Balbino about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Lita proceeded to PNP Station Commander Baguidudol of Dupax del Sur and reported the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>SPO4 Johnny Baguidudol, SPO1 Saulo Fontanilla and SPO4 Alfredo Dotimas were at the police station when Lita reported that her husband was hacked by the appellants.&nbsp; The three officers immediately proceeded with her to the crime scene in order to investigate.&nbsp; They saw Ernesto sprawled on the floor, lying face up near the bed, bathed in blood and undoubtedly dead.&nbsp; Lita told SPO4 Baguidudol who the perpetrators were and where they were headed.&nbsp; He called up his co-policemen at the station and instructed them to apprehend the appellants.&nbsp; SPO1 Fontanilla prepared a sketch of the crime scene. SPO4 Dotimas called on some neighbors to help in bringing the body of the victim to the <i>poblacion</i> for autopsy and embalmment.&nbsp; The three appellants were apprehended by SPO4 Alfonso dela Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> SPO4 Baguidudol and his companions returned to the station and conducted further investigation. Upon questioning, Nestor admitted that he hacked the victim, while Cosme and Palis kept their silence.&nbsp; The following day, the police officers executed a Joint Affidavit in connection with the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Pepito Balgos conducted an autopsy on the victim.

According to him, at around 2:00 in the afternoon of December 3, 1993, while he was grazing his carabao near the house of <i>Manang</i> Lita (Ernesto's wife), he saw Ernesto cutting grass. Ernesto invited him over to his house and so, before heading home, appellant dropped by the former's house.&nbsp; Lita and Ernesto, Jr. were not inside the house.&nbsp; His co-appellants, Palis and Cosme, were not with him during that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Because Ernesto promised to tell him something while he was grazing his carabao, he asked Ernesto what he wanted to say to him.&nbsp; To his surprise, Ernesto said, "You Carriaga are greedy." He told Ernesto that he should better head home.&nbsp; As he turned his back on Ernesto, the latter hacked him at the back portion of his head.&nbsp; When he looked back, he saw that Ernesto was about to hack him a second time, so he immediately unsheathed his <i>bolo</i> and retaliated by hacking Ernesto on the legs. Ernesto jumped towards him, but appellant was able to hack him again. Ernesto fell on his left side. He could no longer remember how many times he hacked Ernesto as his mind went blank. At that moment, he thought he was going to die.&nbsp; After the encounter, appellant headed home, walking slowly.&nbsp; On his way home, he met Palis who helped him reached his house where he treated his injuries with herbal medicine.&nbsp; Moments later, Palis and Cosme, accompanied him to the hospital in Dupax where he was attended to in the hospital for about an hour.&nbsp; From the hospital, Cosme surrendered him to the municipal hall where the latter was slapped, punched and kicked by Station Commander Baguidudol several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The physical examination conducted by Dr. Ernesto Calla of the Dupax District Hospital showed that Nestor sustained hacking wounds on the left temporal area and on the region of the occiput.&nbsp; The medical report reveals that on December 3, 1993, the date that Ernesto was killed, Nestor was treated at the Out-Patient Department of the hospital for "Hacking wound 4 cm. Left Temporal Area" and "Hacking wound 3 cm. Occipital Area".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Dr. Calla further remarked that the physical injuries sustained by appellant required medical attendance for a period of not more than nine days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Appellants Ben Palis and Cosme Carriaga interpose the defenses of denial and alibi.&nbsp; According to Palis, on December 3, 1993, he was at Brgy. Canabay, Dupax del Sur, Nueva Vizcaya to see his ricefield, after which, he proceeded to the house of Doro Bombongan where he played the game of cards, <i>tong-it</i>, with Mariano Bombongan and Cosme. They played from 9:00 in the morning until 2:30 in the afternoon, after which, he walked home to their house at Brgy. Canabay.&nbsp; He stayed home for around 15 minutes, then he headed to their other house at the <i>poblacion</i>.&nbsp; On his way, he met the bloodied Nestor.&nbsp; He accompanied the latter to his home and treated his wound.&nbsp; Then, he went to Cosme's house, around 60 meters away, to inform him about his brother.&nbsp; Cosme rode on his vehicle, and, together, they brought Nestor to the hospital at Dupax del Norte where the latter was treated for around 40 minutes.&nbsp; Then they surrendered him to the Dupax del Sur Police Station.&nbsp; Nestor was invited inside the office of the Police Investigation Officer while he and Cosme waited in the vehicle for about an hour. After the investigation of Nestor, the policemen called for them and they stayed in the office until the arrival of the station commander.&nbsp; When Station Commander Baguidudol arrived, he maltreated them and asked them why they killed Ernesto.&nbsp; Although they insisted that it was Nestor who killed Ernesto, they were all put in prison and have not left the cell since that time.&nbsp; Palis denies that he was present in the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Appellant Cosme Carriaga corroborated the testimony of Palis.&nbsp; In addition, he testified that they surrendered Nestor to the police because the latter admitted to them that he had engaged in a hacking incident with <i>Manong</i><i> Pilong</i>, referring to Ernesto.&nbsp; Further, Cosme related that investigation officer dela Cruz invited them to go inside the office because the relatives of Ernesto who were then in the police station might harm them.&nbsp; To his surprise, however, the station commander kicked him and slapped Palis, while saying "why did you kill my dog?".&nbsp; Cosme claimed that the victim was a police asset who conducted surveillance.&nbsp; Like Palis, Cosme denied that he hacked the victim.&nbsp; He stressed that complainants Lita and Ernesto, Jr. were just taught by the station commander on what to say.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Brothers Mariano and Teodoro Bombongan corroborated the testimony of Palis and Cosme that both played <i>tong-it</i> in Teodoro's house from 9:00 in the morning until 2:30 in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The trial court ruled that the culpability of the appellants had been established beyond reasonable doubt. It held that Nestor was not able to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence the existence and concurrence of the circumstances needed to prove self-defense, while Cosme's and Palis' reliance on alibi and denial are weak defenses as they are easily susceptible of concoction.&nbsp; The trial court found that the prosecution proved by direct and circumstantial evidence the culpability of the three as well as the presence of conspiracy and treachery.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, finding the accused, Nestor Carriaga, Cosme Carriaga and Ben Palis, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, all three accused are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA.<br><br>They are likewise ordered to pay in solidum to the heirs of the victim the amounts of P49,713.75, as actual expenses; P50,000.00, as mandatory death indemnity; P50,000.00 for the income the victim would have had earned by himself for his family; and, P100,000.00, as moral damages.<br><br>The Provincial Warden is directed to transport all three accused to the National Penitentiary as soon as possible and to make a report to the Court about the matter.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>On appeal to this Court, appellant Palis contends that the lower court erred in holding that he was a co-conspirator to the crime of murder for rendering "moral assistance" to his co-accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> while appellants Nestor and Cosme raise the following Assignment of Errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"> <li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ACCORDING FULL CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE TWO ALLEGED EYEWITNESSES, LITA DE GUZMAN AND ERNESTO DE GUZMAN, JR.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN COMPLETELY DISCARDING THE DEFENSE OF ALIBI RAISED BY ACCUSED COSME CARRIAGA.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN COMPLETELY DISCARDING THE DEFENSE OF SELF-DEFENSE RAISED BY THE ACCUSED NESTOR CARRIAGA.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED, NESTOR AND COSME CARRIAGA, HAD NOT BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br></li><li>IN ANY EVENT, THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN REFUSING TO APPRECIATE THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>This Court shall resolve the following issues: (1) whether or not the trial court erred in giving credence to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Lita and Ernesto, Jr.; (2) whether or not the trial court erred in disregarding appellant Nestor's claim of self-defense; (3) whether or not the trial court erred in not giving credence to appellants Cosme's and Palis' defense of alibi and denial; (4) whether or not conspiracy has been established by the prosecution; and (5) whether or not the trial court erred in not appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<br><br>Anent the first issue:&nbsp; As often happens in criminal cases on appeal, this Court is asked to disregard the testimony of the prosecution witnesses for being incredible, and, instead, give full credence to those of the defense witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; When faced with the issue of credibility, the Court ordinarily defers to the factual assessment made by the trial court, the latter being in a better position to decide the question because it had the full opportunity to observe directly the deportment and manner of testifying on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Appellants contend that the trial court erred in giving credence to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Lita and Ernesto, Jr. arguing that the testimonies of the two are inconsistent for whereas Lita testified that appellant Nestor was the first who hacked the victim on the right leg, Ernesto, Jr. declared that it was appellant Cosme.<br><br>After going over the records of the case, the Court finds that while Lita was ambivalent as to who between Nestor and Cosme hacked her husband first, Ernesto, Jr. was positive and categorical in testifying that it was Cosme who hacked his father first and the Carriaga brothers took turns in hacking his father, Ernesto, who was oblivious of the initial attack as he was sleeping.<br><br>Appellants fail to convince the Court on this matter.&nbsp; Witnesses testifying on the same event do not have to be consistent in every detail considering the inevitability of differences in their recollection, viewpoint or impression; total recall or perfect symmetry is not required as long as the witnesses concur on material points.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Both Lita and Ernesto, Jr. positively recognized the three appellants as the assailants of Ernesto.&nbsp; They have known the appellants even before the incident and therefore they could not have been mistaken as to their identities.&nbsp; They unwaveringly declared that they saw the Carriaga brothers each holding a <i>bolo </i>enter their house while Ben Palis stood guard at the door.&nbsp; They were firm in their identification of appellants even under rigid cross-examination.<br><br>Appellants further contend that Ernesto, Jr.'s credibility is suspect given the contradictions in his sworn statement and his testimony in court.&nbsp; In his sworn declaration, Ernesto, Jr. stated that after witnessing Cosme hack the right leg of his father, he didn't see what transpired after that, but on the witness stand, he narrated the sequence of the hack blows inflicted by the Carriaga brothers upon his father.&nbsp; Appellants insist that the blow-by-blow account given by Ernesto, Jr. on the witness stand is a sure sign of fabrication.<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp; As already stated, Ernesto, Jr. knew the appellants as friends of his father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> His detailed narration on the witness stand of the events of December 3, 1993 is worthy of belief.&nbsp; He was consistent even on cross-examination.&nbsp; That he remembered the sequence of blows delivered by the appellants on his father is not far-fetched.&nbsp; Human experience tells us that a first-hand experience of a twelve-year old seeing the dastardly killing of his own father by people known to him as friends of his father will surely be etched in his memory.<br><br>Further, sworn statements, which are <i>ex parte</i>, are often incomplete and inaccurate because of partial suggestion or want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall all connected circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It is axiomatic that as between the sworn statement and the testimony of the complainant given in court, the latter is given more weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Appellants further insist that the testimony of Lita and Ernesto, Jr. are incredible because while both of them testified that the victim was lying on his right side when he was hacked, the autopsy report reveals that most of the wounds sustained by the victim were on his right side.<br><br>We are not convinced. Indeed, both Lita and Ernesto, Jr. testified that Ernesto was lying on his right side when he was hacked.&nbsp; Lita saw the first hack inflicted on the leg of the victim. She testified thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">COURT</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Will you point to that body of your husband that was hacked by Cosme Carriaga?

If appellant Nestor's claim that unlawful aggression came from Ernesto is true, the wounds sustained by the victim prove that he did not stop hacking the victim after he (appellant) had rendered Ernesto helpless when the latter fell as a result of the second hacking in which case his claim of self-defense must fail. The nature, number and location of the wounds sustained by the victim belie the assertion of self-defense since the gravity of said wounds is indicative of a determined effort to kill and not just to defend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> A person making a defense has no more right to attack an aggression when the unlawful aggression has ceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the infliction of incised and lacerated wounds on the victim prove that two weapons were used thus demolishing appellant Nestor's testimony that he alone hacked the victim.

With the use of <i>bolos</i>, appellants Nestor and Cosme went to the sleeping Ernesto and hacked him repeatedly and mercilessly while appellant Palis watched and stood by the door of the house; after which, all three of them left Ernesto's house and together, rode in a jeepney. The rule is that when the defendants by their acts aimed at the same object, one performing one part and the other performing another part so as to complete it, with a view to the attainment of the same object, and their acts, though apparently independent, were in fact concerted and cooperative, indicating closeness of personal association, concerted action and concurrence of sentiments, the court will be justified in concluding that said defendants were engaged in a conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Appellants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as unmistakably to indicate a common purpose or design in bringing about the crime is clear.&nbsp; Cosme and Nestor delivered the hack blows upon the victim while Palis placed himself by the door of the house. The fact that Palis did not hack the victim does not negate his participation in the conspiracy.&nbsp; His act of barging into the house of Ernesto with appellants Nestor and Cosme who were armed with <i>bolos</i> and standing by the door while his two companions hack Ernesto to death was a willful act or an act of complicity showing unity of purpose and design to kill Ernesto.&nbsp; There exists no doubt that there was conspiracy among appellants Nestor, Cosme and Palis.&nbsp; It is not necessary that all the participants deliver the fatal blow, as the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>However, under the facts of the case, we deem it necessary that we distinguish the nature of the participation of appellants Nestor, Cosme and Palis.<br><br>Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code provides:<br><blockquote> Art. 17.&nbsp; <i>Principals</i>.&nbsp; -&nbsp; The following are considered principals: <ol><li>Those who take a direct part in the execution of the act.<br><br></li><li>Those who directly force or induce others to commit it.<br><br></li><li>Those who cooperate in the commission of the offense by another act without which it would not have been accomplished.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Thus, in the commission of a crime by two or more persons, those who take direct participation are principals by direct participation under paragraph 1 above; those who directly force or induce others to commit the crime are principals by induction under paragraph 2 above; while those who cooperate in the commission of the crime by another act without which the commission of the offense would not have been accomplished are principals by indispensable cooperation under paragraph 3 of Article 17 as above-quoted.<br><br>In the present case, it is clear that appellants Nestor and Cosme are principals by direct participation.&nbsp; Both of them with the same purpose and design hacked Ernesto repeatedly to kill the victim.<br><br>The question is:&nbsp; What is the nature of participation of appellant Palis?&nbsp; It is an established fact borne by the prosecution evidence that the three appellants went inside the house of Ernesto without prior notice or permission from the occupants of the house; that appellant Palis merely stood by the door of the house while his co-appellants hacked Ernesto to death; that he left the scene of the crime together with the other appellants; and that they were altogether found riding in a jeepney and arrested by the police.&nbsp; That Palis just stood by the door without saying anything cannot therefore be considered as a mere passive presence that would have negated his participation as a conspirator.&nbsp; However, there are no other facts established by the prosecution that would prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant Palis committed acts in the killing of Ernesto that would categorize him as a principal by induction, by direct participation or by indispensable cooperation. What is certain from the facts established by the prosecution, is that he had the same purpose and design as the other appellants as shown by the fact that he went inside the house of the victim, uninvited and unannounced together with his co-appellants Nestor and Cosme who were armed with <i>bolos</i>; and that after the hacking, he left the house together with appellants Nestor and Cosme and rode a jeepney together.<br><br>In such case, we apply our ruling in <i>People vs. Ubiña</i> where we held that when an accused does not fall under any of the three concepts defined in Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code, he may only be considered guilty as an accomplice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Before the Court proceeds to resolve the fifth issue, it is necessary that the Court should pass upon the question whether or not appellants are guilty of treachery and abuse of superior strength.<br><br>We hold that the killing of Ernesto was attended by treachery.&nbsp; There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and especially to ensure its execution without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Two elements must therefore concur: (1) the means of execution employed gives the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and (2) the means of execution was deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The essence of treachery is a swift and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on his part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The victim in this case was caught by surprise when the assailants suddenly entered his house and attacked him while he was asleep.&nbsp; Thus, he had no chance to fight back or defend himself.&nbsp; The number of the victim's wounds and his relative position when found dead by the police emphasized further the existence of treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The victim was hacked in the occiput region of his head, on the shoulder, arm, chest, thigh, leg and at the back.&nbsp; The means, method and form of the attack in this case were, therefore, consciously adopted and effectively prevented the victim from employing a defense against his attackers.<br><br>The attendant circumstance of treachery qualified the killing to murder as defined in paragraph 1 of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>In determining the proper penalty to be imposed, the next step is to determine the presence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstance.&nbsp; Since treachery attended the killing, abuse of superior strength alleged in the Information is absorbed by said circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Court finds no other aggravating circumstance that was alleged in the Information and proven by the prosecution.<br><br>We come now to the fifth issue: whether or not the trial court erred in refusing to consider the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in favor of the appellants.
