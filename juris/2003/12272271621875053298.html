				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On May 22, 2000, in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-CR-2738, 97-CR-2739 and 97-CR-2740, the Regional Trial Court of Benguet, Branch 62, found accused-appellant Tacio Emilio guilty of three (3) counts of rape of his minor stepdaughter and imposed upon him the penalty of death for each.<br><br>The prosecution charged accused-appellant in separate Informations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the inculpatory portions of which read as follows: <br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Criminal Case No. 97-CR-2738</span><br></div><br>That on or about the month of October 1995, at Bayabas, Municipality of Sablan, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge and sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter AAA, a thirteen year old minor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. 97-CR-2739<br></center><br>That on or about the 20<sup>th</sup> day of October 1996, at Bayabas, Municipality of Sablan, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge and sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter AAA, a thirteen year old minor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;">Criminal Case No. 97-CR-2740<br></center><br>That on or about the month of October 1995, at Bayabas, Municipality of Sablan, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge and sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter AAA, a thirteen year old minor.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>When arraigned on March 26, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> accused-appellant, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charges, whereupon joint trial commenced.<br><br>Culled from the records of the case are the following facts established by the prosecution:<br><br>Private complainant AAA and her half-sister Latifa were born out of wedlock to <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teresita Eslao</span> of Bayabas, Sablan, Benguet. Per her birth certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup> she was born on December 11, 1983.<br><br>On January 18, 1991, AAA’s mother <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teresita Eslao</span> married accused-appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> following which the couple, together with AAA and Latifa, resided at <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teresita’s</span> house in Sitio Bekes, Bayabas, Sablan, Benguet. Wanting to eke out a more comfortable life for her family, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teresita</span> went to work in Malaysia on April 18, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> leaving AAA and her 4-year old<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> sister Latifa under the care and custody of their stepfather-accused-appellant.<br><br>As was her wont, AAA slept in their living room while accused-appellant and her half-sister slept at the nearby bedroom.<br><br>At around midnight one day in <b>October 1995</b>, 11-year old AAA was roused from her sleep by accused-appellant who lay on top of her. By then, the blanket covering her had been removed and her short pants and underwear pulled down. And accused-appellant was inserting his penis into her vagina<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> on account of which she felt searing pain. Crying unabashedly, she tried to resist by pushing him but to no avail. After accused-appellant succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her, he repaired back to the bedroom.<br><br>Already exhausted, AAA eventually fell asleep. She later awoke not long after when she felt that accused-appellant was again on top of her. Although gripped with fear, she managed to push him away, drawing accused-appellant to return to the bedroom. She thus remained awake until daybreak.<br><br>AAA then prepared breakfast and partook of it with her sister and accused-appellant who looked at her menacingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Around midnight of that day, she again awoke to find accused-appellant on top of her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Again, accused-appellant had already pulled down her short pants and underwear and was inserting his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup> Overcome by fear, she cried and albeit she struggled to resist his advances by pushing accused-appellant away, her efforts proved to be no match to his strength. His lust satisfied, accused-appellant went back to the bedroom.<br><br>When morning came, AAA again prepared and had breakfast with her sister and accused-appellant. She performed the chores she had been accustomed to doing – washing the dishes, cleaning the house, and washing their clothes.<br><br>Close to a month after the two October 1995 incidents, or in November of the same year,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> she went to live with her maternal grandmother. It was during this month that her mother <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teresita</span> arrived from Malaysia for a three-week vacation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; She, however, kept mum about the incidents, fearful of the repercussions that her revelation might bring.<br><br>On <b>October 20, 1996</b>, AAA and her cousins Jonah Hemeno and Nerissa Bayating<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> went to the house of her mother where they were to stay overnight. As she lay asleep between her cousins in the living room, she awoke to again find accused-appellant on top of her, inserting his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She thereupon pushed him away by swinging her right hand, causing accused-appellant to move to her right side to thereby push her cousin Nerissa. She immediately pulled up her underwear and jogging pants with her right foot,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and as she rose up crying, accused-appellant asked her why she reacted that way but she merely cursed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> By this time, Jonah and Nerissa had awakened and asked her why she was crying. Without answering them, she left and headed toward the house of her grandmother<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to whom she revealed her ordeals. She did also later reveal her ordeals to her uncles <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Carlos Mayunget</span>, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Paquito Ap-ap</span> and <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Avelino Siano</span> who advised her to report to the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On December 13, 1996, AAA finally informed, via telephone, her mother who was in Malaysia about her “Daddy” raping her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19] </sup>and pleaded with her to come home to attend to the matter. Her mother did come to the Philippines not long after.<br><br>On January 2, 1997, AAA executed a sworn statement at the Investigation Section of the Sablan Police Station<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and went to the Provincial Prosecutor’s Office at La Trinidad, Benguet where she filed the criminal complaints against accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; She then proceeded to the Municipal Health Office of Sablan, Benguet where Dr. Judith T. Codamon, medico-legal officer of the municipality, conducted a physical examination on her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which yielded the following results: aileen<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Perineal area - no excoriations, no lesions<br>Hymen lacerated, 3:00 o’clock position <br>Vagina admits 2 fingers with ease<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></div><br>The trial court, brushing aside accused-appellant’s denial, found accused-appellant guilty as charged in its decision on review, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads <i>verbatim</i> as follows:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court finds Tacio Emilio y Inte guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in three (3) counts as charged in the three Informations, defined and penalized by Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, aggravated by the fact that the accused Tacio Emilio y Inte is the stepfather of the victim, AAA, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of DEATH for each count of rape as charged; to indemnify AAA, the victim, the sum of Seventy Five Thousand (P75,000.00) Pesos for each count of rape; and to pay AAA the sum of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos for each count of rape as moral damages.<br><br>Pursuant to Administrative Circular No. 4-92-A of the Court Administrator, the Provincial Jail Warden of Benguet Province is directed to immediately transfer the said accused Tacio Emilio y Inte to the custody of the Bureau of Corrections, City of Muntinlupa, Metro Manila.<br><br>Conformably with Section 1, Rule 111, Rules of Court, the corresponding filing fee for the Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos herein awarded as moral damages for each count of rape shall constitute a first lien on this judgment.<br><br>Let a copy of this Judgment be furnished to the Provincial Jail Warden of Benguet Province for his information and guidance.<br><br>Let the records of these cases be transmitted to the Supreme Court for automatic review and judgment within the period provided by law.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>The cases are now before this Court for automatic review pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>Accused-appellant maintains his innocence and assigns the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT APPRECIATE THE UNREASONABLY LONG AND UNEXPLAINED DELAY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT IN INSTITUTING CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT APPRECIATE THE LACK OF CREDIBILITY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT APPRECIATE THE ODD CONDUCT OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ALLEGED RAPE.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT RELIED ON THE LACK OF MOTIVE OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED WITH A FINDING OF GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In the main, accused-appellant assails the credibility of AAA. He posits that her unreasonable and unexplained delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities and to her relatives renders her testimony highly dubious and suspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He thus proffers that, in all probability, her charges are fabricated.<br><br>This Court is not persuaded. The silence of the offended party in a case of rape, or her failure to disclose her defilement without loss of time to persons close to her and to report the matter to the authorities, does not perforce warrant the conclusion that she was not sexually molested and that her charges against the accused are all baseless, untrue and fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> If delay in making a criminal accusation is satisfactorily explained,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> it does not impair the credibility of a witness.<br><br>At the time of the rape incidents, AAA was barely at the threshold of adolescence. Her assailant is the husband of her mother whom she lived with and treated as her own parent. Her claim that fear prevented her from at once revealing what had been done to her by accused-appellant whom she had priorly seen fire his gun is not hard to believe.

Failure of the victim to shout for help does not, however, negate the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> For, the workings of the human mind under emotional stress are unpredictable, such that people react differently to startling situations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The explanation of AAA that extreme fright and shock rendered her unable to scream for help<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> is, to this Court, satisfactory. It bears noting that she not only cried. She struggled to extricate herself from him during the incidents.<br><br>As to the way AAA comported herself after the rape incidents, the same cannot infirm her credibility. Being then only 11 in 1995 and 12 in 1996, she should not be judged by the norms of behavior expected of mature persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The alleged inconsistencies in AAA’s testimony pertaining to the persons to whom she reported the incidents prior to reporting them to the police and the exact positions of accused-appellant while he was on top of her are minor details which do not affect the essential integrity and veracity of her testimony. In fact they tend to buttress, rather than weaken, her credibility because they erase any suspicion of coached or rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As observed by the trial court:<br><blockquote> x x x Her answers were straightforward, categorical and spontaneous. x x x Even when pressed with embarrassing questions, she answered them bereft of equivocation and stood firm on her experience of defloration, not once but three times. Absent were telltales (sic) of prevarication in her entire testimony. This is not to say that her testimony was impeccable. Indeed, because of the long direct and cross-examinations, AAA committed, here and there, in her testimony, inconsistencies or contradictions but they refer to inconsequential details. Her depiction of the three sexual assaults of Tacio Emilio was candid and compatible with human experience. There were no traces of coached testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>As for the reasons which accused-appellant proffers, as reflected in his following testimony, could have motivated AAA’s filing of the charges against him:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="center"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">AAA, your stepdaughter, who was thirteen (13) years old in 1995 accused you of three (3) serious offenses of rape, can you tell the Court what reason has she to accuse you of three (3) serious offenses?

It is farfetched to consider or believe that AAA would purposely subject herself to the humiliation attendant to an accusation for rape for the above-mentioned reasons, especially given her tender years and non-exposure to the ways of the world.<br><br>Clutching at straws, accused-appellant claims that it was impossible for him to have raped AAA as he is impotent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He failed, however, to present evidence to that effect, or that if he is, that his impotency is absolute. The presumption in favor of his potency<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> thus remains.<br><br>In fine, AAA’s testimony not only stood the test of credibility. It was corroborated by Dr. Codamon’s finding of lacerations in her hymen which, as opined by her, are most commonly caused by the entry of a turgid penis into the vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The rape of a stepdaughter by her stepfather is analogous to the sexual assault committed by a father against his own daughter. The stepfather’s moral ascendancy and influence over his stepdaughter substitutes for violence and intimidation as an element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44] </sup>He does not have to threaten the stepdaughter because she is cowed into submission when gripped with the fear of refusing the advances of a person she customarily obeys.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> There is no gainsaying that AAA looked upon accused-appellant as an authority figure, her stepfather of more than four years on whom, by accused-appellant’s own information,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> she was <b>entirely dependent</b> for her day-to-day needs.<br><br>The three informations allege that AAA was 13 years old at the time of the commission of the crimes. Her birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> presented during the trial shows, however, that she was born on December 11, 1983. Hence, she was 11 years and 10 months old when the first and second rape incidents took place in October 1995 and 12 years and 10 months Old when the third rape incident occurred in November 1996.

Undoubtedly, however, she was a minor, below 18 years of age, when the rape incidents of October 1995 took place.<br><br>The relationship of accused-appellant to AAA and her minority (below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crimes) having been alleged and proved, he must be meted the death penalty following Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659 which provides:<br><blockquote> Article 335. <i>When and how rape is committed.</i><br><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances: <ol><li><b>when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a</b> parent, ascendant, <b>step-parent</b>, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. </li></ol> x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Three members of this Court continue, however, to maintain the unconstitutionality of R.A. 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty. Nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar.<br><br>With respect to the civil aspect of the case, this Court further awards to AAA exemplary damages, following jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> in the amount of P25,000.00 for each count.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Benguet, Branch 62 in Criminal Case Nos. 97-CR-2738, 97-CR-2739 and 97-CR-2740 is <b>AFFIRMED, with MODIFICATION</b> consisting of the further award to the private complainant AAA of P25,000.00 (or a total of P75,000.00) as exemplary damages.<br><br>In accordance with Section 25 of R.A. 7659 amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon the finality of this decision, let the records of these cases be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of the pardoning power.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio</i>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing,&nbsp; Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio, Austria-Martinez, Corona, Carpio-Morales, Callejo, Sr.,</i> and <i>Azcuna, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><i>Ynares-Santiago, J.</i>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="left"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 16-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Original Records at 37 and 39.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit “B,” <i>Id.</i> at 87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exhibit “C,” <i>Id.</i> at 88.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1997 at 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, May 5, 1998 at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, June 16, 1997 at 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, July 30, 1997 at 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> TSN, June 23, 1997 at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1997 at 15<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> TSN, June 23, 1997 at 17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> TSN, June 25, 1997 at 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> TSN, June 30, 1997 at 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TSN, October 1, 1997 at 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> TSN, June 25, 1997 at 23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 25-27.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <i>Id.</i> at 31.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Exhibit “A,” Original Records at 11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> RTC Decision at 30-31, <i>Rollo</i> at 75-76.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Appellant’s Brief at 1, <i>Rollo</i> at 86.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Appellant’s Brief at 9, <i>Rollo</i> at 91.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <i>People v.
