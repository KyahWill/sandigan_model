charges accused- appellant with violation of the Anti-Carnapping Act allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote> That on or about April 3, 1996, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating with others whose true names, identities and present whereabouts are still unknown and helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to gain, forcibly take and carry away or carnap two (2) motor vehicles, more particularly described as follows:<br><br>One (1) Unit, Toyota Tamaraw FX, BGC Taxi with Plate No. NYU-381 and<br><br>One (1) Unit, Toyota Tamaraw Delivery Van with Plate No. PBM-990<br><br>valued at P400,000.00 more or less from the drivers Felix Buenaobra y Bumaba and Nomeriano Castor y Serbo, respectively, without their consent, to the damage and prejudice of the drivers/owners thereof in the aforesaid amount of P400,000.00, Philippine currency.<br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges.&nbsp; Joint trial of the cases thereupon ensued.<br><br>From the evidence for the prosecution, the following facts are established:<br><br>At about 4:00 p. m. of April 3, 1996, a group of more than six armed men including accused-appellant barged into the Tondo General Hospital in Honorio Lopez Boulevard, Balut, Tondo, Manila.<br><br>Security guard Eric Santos who was posted at the hospital emergency room had just finished talking to a person who was asking about the location of the x-ray room when one of the armed men pointed a gun at him, announced that there was a holdup, and instructed him to keep still as he took his firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Simultaneously, accused-appellant pointed a gun at, and grabbed the firearm<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of, another security guard, Benjamin Saclolo, who was seated in front of a desk at the emergency room.<br><br>Santos grappled with his assailant for the possession of the latter’s gun in the course of which Santos’ other firearm, a service revolver, was accidentally pulled out of its holster, resulting to a gunshot.&nbsp; This caught the attention of accused-appellant who pointed his gun at Santos and warned him that he would shoot him should he make one false move.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Santos then pushed his assailant in the direction of accused-appellant, causing the former to fall at which instant Santos ran but not before he was dispossessed of his service revolver.<br><br>In the meantime, about 20 meters away<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>, four members of the group entered the cashier’s office of the hospital and ordered the employees to lie down on the floor.&nbsp; One of them pointed a gun at cashier Rodrigo Alonzo and ordered him to open the vault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Before Alonzo could do as instructed,&nbsp; he was searched for weapons in the course of which his wallet containing P450.00 in cash was taken. Alonzo then opened the vault which the four emptied of P1,010,274.90 in cash.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>While the four malefactors were at the cashier’s office, another security guard, Pio Gomez who was manning the&nbsp; hospital gate and conversing with maintenance plumber Cesar Rosella, was disarmed of his service pistol, pushed outside the hospital premises, and shot twice by one of the armed men.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The four armed men who emptied the vault then rushed out of the hospital and one of them also shot Gomez who had by then collapsed on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Two of them headed toward a Toyota Tamaraw vehicle driven by Numeriano Castor which was on a stop position, due to heavy traffic, in front of the hospital at San Rafael Street.&nbsp; One of the duo ordered the passenger at the front seat to get off the vehicle.&nbsp; The other, after forcing Castor to alight from the vehicle, drove it and fled with his companion.<br><br>That same afternoon of April 3, 1996, at around 6:00 o’clock, the vehicle, valued at P300,000.00, was found abandoned somewhere in Manila and was brought back to the hospital by police authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup><br><br>More than a month and three weeks after the heist, or on May 27, 1996, accused-appellant was arrested by police authorities. At the Western Police District, Ermita, Manila, he was positively identified in a police line­-up by the hospital security guards Santos and Saclolo as one of the two armed men who announced a holdup and took their firearms at the emergency&nbsp; room of the hospital on the afternoon of April 3, 1996.&nbsp; Santos and Saclolo thereupon executed sworn statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On June 8, 1996, security guard Gomez who sustained four gunshot wounds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14] </sup> expired. The findings on the autopsy conducted on his body by Dr. Juan Garcia of the Tondo Medical Center were incorporated in a medico-legal certificate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>For the hospitalization and medical expenses of Gomez, his family incurred P70,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; And for funeral and miscellaneous expenses, the amount of P48,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> was incurred.<br><br>As for the defense, lone witness accused-appellant came up with an alibi.&nbsp; He claimed that between 3:00 p. m.&nbsp; and 4:00 p. m. of April 3, 1996, he and his wife were at Balic-balic, Sampaloc, Manila looking for a house to rent, and they returned home at about 7:00 p. m., thus rendering it impossible for him to be present at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Discrediting accused-appellant’s alibi in favor of his positive identification by security guards Santos and Saclolo as one of the malefactors, the trial court convicted him of robbery with homicide in the first case and carnapping in the second in its Decision of April 25, 2000 on review, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 96-150264, the court finds accused Ricardo Napalit y Paral guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with homicide with the attendant aggravating circumstance of the offense having been committed by an organized/syndicated crime group of which the accused belongs, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of death by lethal injection and to pay the costs.<br><br>On the civil liability of the accused, the court further sentences him to pay Evelyn Gomez, widow of the slain security guard, Pio Gomez, actual and moral damages in the respective sums of P118,000.00 and P300,000.00, and indemnity for the loss of life of the victim in the sum of P50,000.00, with interest thereon at the legal rate of 6% per annum from this date until fully paid.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 97-156381, the court likewise, finds accused Ricardo Napalit y Paral guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Violation of R.A. 6539, or carnapping, and sentences him to suffer imprisonment of 25 years and to pay the costs. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>In his brief, accused-appellant ascribes the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"> <li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED.<br><br></li><li>EVEN GRANTING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT WAS A CO-CONSPIRATOR IN THE PLAN TO COMMIT ROBBERY, THE TRIAL COURT, NONETHELESS, ERRED IN ATTRIBUTING TO HIM AND HOLDING HIM LIABLE FOR THE CRIME OF HOMICIDE WHICH HAPPENED ON THE OCCASION OF THE ROBBERY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>On the first assigned error, accused-appellant maintains that his identification by Santos and Saclolo as one of the more than six armed men during the incident was not established with moral certainty for, so he argues, said witnesses were at the time of the robbery fraught with fear and nervousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; To buttress his claim, accused-appellant draws attention to Santos’ failure to hear the gunshot which first hit Gomez when he (Santos) was struggling with his assailant for the possession of the latter’s gun, which failure, accused-appellant alleges, prevented Santos from taking a clear look at the armed man attending to Saclolo, identified as accused-appellant, since his (Santos’) attention was fully focused on his assailant.<br><br>Accused-appellant readily admits, however, that both Santos and Saclolo were credible, conceding that their respective testimonies were straightforward and consistent insofar as their recollection of the disarming incident is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>When the issue of credibility is involved, appellate courts generally do not disturb the findings of the trial court since the latter is in a better position to pass on it, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying, unless it is shown that it overlooked certain facts or circumstances of substance that, if considered, could affect the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the trial court found the testimony of witnesses Santos and Saclolo to be worthy of credence.&nbsp; From the transcripts of the stenographic&nbsp; notes of their testimonies, this Court finds that, indeed, they merit credence.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are straightforward and consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the following answers of Santos, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">On April 3, 1996, at about 4:05 p.m., while you are manning the emergency room of the Tondo General Hospital, do you recall of any unusual incident that took place? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify">At around 4:00 p.m. that date, while I was talking to a person who was asking about the location of the x-ray room, someone pointed a gun at me and told me not to move and that it was a holdup, and he took my firearm.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td><div align="justify">What else happened after that man poked a gun at you and took your firearm? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td><div align="justify">When I raised up my hand, I look at the direction where my co-security guard was and I noticed that he was also disarmed by a companion of the man who poked a gun at me and when the man that disarmed the other security guard was leaving the premises, I noticed that the man poking a gun at me was nervous because his gun was shaking and because of this observation and considering that my co-security guard was nearby, I was emboldened to grab the gun that was being poked at me so I grappled with the man that was poking a gun at me by grabbing the gun.&nbsp;

Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, provides:<br><blockquote> Article 294.&nbsp; <i>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons. – Penalties. </i>– Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<b> </b><ol><b></b><li>The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death,<b> <b>when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed</b>, </b>or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.<b> </b></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"> x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></div></blockquote>In robbery with homicide cases, the prosecution needs to prove these elements: (a) the taking of personal property is perpetrated by means of violence or intimidation against a person; (b) the property taken belongs to another; (c) the taking is characterized by intent to gain or <i>animus lucrandi</i>; and (d) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, the crime of homicide, here used in its generic sense, is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In a long line of cases, this Court has ruled that whenever homicide is committed as a consequence or on the occasion of the robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals in the special complex crime of robbery with homicide although they did not take part in the homicide, unless it is clearly shown that they endeavored to prevent the homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Direct proof of a previous agreement to commit a crime is not indispensable in conspiracy.&nbsp; It may be deduced from the mode and manner by which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused themselves, when such point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>From the time accused-appellant and his companions entered the hospital and announced a holdup up to the time they fled, in the course of which security guard Gomez was shot, there can be no other conclusion than that they hatched a criminal scheme, synchronized their acts for unity in its execution, and aided each other for its consummation.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by the trial court, the united, concerted and coordinated contemporaneous acts of accused-appellant and his companions in marauding the hospital, neutralizing its security guards and robbing it of P1,010,274.90 unerringly indicate a well-planned robbery operation and a conspiracy among them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>As conspiracy has been established, all the conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the manner and extent of their participation since, in conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>That accused-appellant did not shoot Gomez is immaterial.&nbsp; Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code is clear and leaves no room for any other interpretation.&nbsp; For, for robbery with homicide to exist, it is sufficient that a homicide results <b>by reason or on the occasion</b> of robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; The law of course exculpates a person who takes part in the robbery from the special complex crime of robbery with homicide and punishes him only for simple robbery when there is proof that he tried to prevent the homicide.&nbsp; No such proof, however, was offered.<br><br>As an appeal in a criminal proceeding throws the whole case open for review, it becomes the duty of this Court to correct errors it may find in the appealed judgment even if they have not been specifically assigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [36]</sup><br><br>One such error committed by the trial court which was not assigned by accused-appellant is its appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of the offense being committed by a person belonging to an organized or syndicated crime group under Article 62 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659.<br><br>While accused-appellant and company confederated and mutually helped one another for the purpose of gain, <b>that they formed part of a group organized for the general purpose of committing crimes for gain</b>, which is the essence of a syndicated or organized crime group,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> was neither alleged nor proved.<br><br>There being then no aggravating circumstance to be appreciated, the proper imposable penalty for the commission of the crime of robbery with homicide is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, following Article 63 (2) of the Revised Penal Code which states that when there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.<br><br>And the trial court erred too in finding accused-appellant guilty of the Anti-Carnapping Act.&nbsp; Carnapping, as defined under Section 2, paragraph 2 of this special law, is the taking, with intent to gain, of a motor vehicle belonging to another without the latter’s consent, or by means of violence against or intimidation of persons, or by use of force upon things.&nbsp; The elements of carnapping are thus: (a) the taking of a motor vehicle which belongs to another; (b) the taking is without the consent of the owner or by means of violence against or intimidation of persons or by using force upon things;
