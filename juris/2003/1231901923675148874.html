The prosecution presented four witnesses: (1) the victim Venilda; (2) Venilda's younger sister and appellant's daughter, Belinda Cariñaga; (3) Venilda's mother and appellant's wife, Vetelina Cariñaga; and (4) Dr. Lea Remonte, municipal health officer of Ligao, Albay, who conducted the medical examination on Venilda.<br><br>In its Consolidated Decision, the trial court summarized the prosecution's version of the incident as follows:<br><blockquote>VENILDA CARIÑAGA, 12 years old, a Grade VI pupil and a resident of Bonga, Ligao, Albay, testified she was born on November 23, 1987. Her father is Juan Cariñaga, the accused, and her mother is Vetelina Cariñaga. They are five (5)<i> </i>in the family. She is the eldest, next is Belinda, then Nelson, Raymart, and Joanne, the youngest. On November 23, 1998 at about 4:00 o'clock in the morning, her mother and father left for the Poblacion of Ligao, Albay to go to the market. After her parents left, she slept again. While she was already sleeping at about 5:00 o'clock her father came back and opened the main door. Their house has no room and at that time she was sleeping on one side of the house. After opening the door, her father put out the fluorescent lamp and pulled down her shorts and panty. Her father also removed his shorts and his brief[s] then laid on top of her. He opened her thighs and applied saliva on her vagina. He attempted to insert his penis inside her vagina but was able to put only the half of it inside. When her father tried to insert his penis she felt pain and pushed him away. Later she felt something slimy and noticed sticky substance on her thighs and vagina. Her father then removed his shirt and wiped her vagina with it and told her not to tell her mother or he will kill them all. After that her father left. Her mother returned home that day but she did not tell her or anybody of what happened because of fear.<br><br>On December 15<i>, </i>1998 at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon she was outside their house playing with Belinda together with her other siblings. The nearest house to their house is about 9 to 10 meters [away]. Then her father who was inside their house called her. She and her youngest sister who was then 2 years old went inside the house leaving the others behind outside. Her youngest sister was already walking then. Inside the house her father told her to lie down but she told him she will move her bowel but her father did not let her go. Then her father removed her shorts and panty and he also removed his shorts and brief[s] and then laid on top of her. Again he tried to insert his penis inside her vagina but half of his penis entered. After inserting his penis his [sic] father tried to press it down while his body was moving up and down. Her father remained on top for sometime. After that her father used his white shirt and wiped her vagina. At that time her mother was in the Poblacion of Ligao, selling vegetables in the market stall. Her mother that December 15<i>, </i>1998 [sic], arrived already in the evening but she did not tell her again what happened to her. Her sister, Belinda, told her mother, that she was raped. And when her mother asked her if she was raped she answered she was. Then her mother brought her to the Poblacion at the Police Station to report the incident. When both incidents happened she was in Grade Five.<br><br>On cross-examination, VeniIda describing their sleeping arrangement in their house testified that on her right was the wall and [to] her left was Belinda, next, to Belinda was Nelson, Raymart, Joanne and next to Joanne was her mother. All sleep on the floor. When her father came back her father slept near Joanne and when she woke up her father was still sleeping beside Joanne. After waking up at 5:30 she cooked then their youngest brother also woke up. She admitted she had a peaceful sleep.<br><br>Cross-examined on the December 15, 1998 incident Venilda testified that in the afternoon at about 5:00 o'clock she was at their neighbor's place playing with Roda. Roda is 13 years old and is the daughter of her mother's brother. Noise in their house can be heard at Roda's parents' house and at that time Roda's parents were in their house. She went home with Joanne at 4:00 p.m. and her father was in the house sleeping. Inside the house she cooked and after she was finished cooking her father called her. Her other brother and sister were still outside then. After she went near her father, the latter told her to get inside the place they are sleeping and as told she went inside. Their house has a bedroom and a sala. Inside the bedroom her father told her to remove her shorts. She did not remove her shorts because she expected something again to happen. So, her father held her hand and pulled her. She did not shout because her siblings were outside and her father threatened her. Her brothers and sisters came home later and by 6:00 o'clock in the evening together with their father they ate their supper. Her mother arrived home at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening.<br><br>Giving a clearer account on redirect of the November 23, 1998 incident, Venilda declared her father was to accompany her mother only up to her Aunt's (mother's sister) store which is far from their house. Her mother was the one to proceed to the market. When her father arrived she did not cook yet because it was still dark. What her father did upon arrival and entering the house was to put off the light and then moved her sibling next to her then removed her shorts and panty and laid on top of her. And then while on top [he] applied saliva on the vagina.<br><br>She can remember well what her father did on November 23, 1998 because that was her birthday. That time Nelson was about 9 years old and Raymart was <i>5 </i>years old. She did not shout because her sister was asleep. She cried when her father raped her but she was not able to cry out loud.<br><br>BELINDA CARIÑAGA, 10 years old and Grade III pupil when she took the witness stand testified that the accused is her father. On November 23, 1998 at about 5:00 o'clock in the morning she was in their house at Bonga, Ligao, Albay cooking. Her Papa undressed and removed the shorts and panty of her Ate then parted her knees and laid on top of her. Her father held his penis and inserted it to her Ate's vagina. At that time their mother was in Oas, Albay selling. When she returned she told her mother what her father did and her mother cried.<br><br>On cross-examination, Belinda said she was in the kitchen cooking rice when her sister was raped by their father. Their bedroom to their kitchen is near. Ate pushed her father but did not shout. She (Belinda) also did not shout for help. Her mother came home about 5:00 in the afternoon while her father was gathering gourds. She reported to her mother that same day. After learning about it her mother went to the doctor. She did not confront her father about it. There are five <i>(5) </i>siblings in their family, three (3) girls and two (2) boys. The eldest is her ate. And in their house there is only one (1) room where all in the family sleep. Belinda declared she can recall that her Ate was raped by their father three (3) times. The second time she cannot recall but it was noon time. The third time she remembers was on December <i>15, </i>1998 at 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon. The second and third time her Ate was raped her siblings were with their grandmother.<br><br>VETELINA CARIÑAGA, 32, married, housewife[,] of Bonga, Ligao, Albay, testified she and the accused Juan Cariñaga are legally married (Exh. "A"). Venilda, the eldest in the family is their daughter (Exh. "B"). Her daughter Belinda told her on a Friday, January 22, 1999 that her husband raped Venilda. Belinda was crying when she told her about it. When she learned about it she felt she lost all her senses and [became] confused. The next thing she did was to dress Venilda and brought her to Dr. Prelligera. The latter, however, suggested to bring Venilda to the Municipal Health Office. Following Prelligera's advice she brought Venilda to the Municipal Health Office where she was examined and after her examination she went to the police where she executed an affidavit and complaint.<br><br>On cross-examination, Vetelina admitted that prior to November 23, 1998 she and her husband had already a misunderstanding because the latter made "passes" at her sister Jeannie Bataller.<br><br>DR. LEA REMONTE, Municipal Health Officer of Ligao, Albay testified that as a member of the municipality's Child Crises Management Unit which takes care of victims of rape and battered housewife, the PNP and DSWD made a request for her to conduct an examination on Venilda. The latter was brought to her by the DSWD accompanied by the mother and an aunt. She found out during that examination that the offender was the patient's father, Juan Cariñaga. Her medical findings are contained in the medical certificate she issued (Exh. "C") to wit:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">"External Examination:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">-</td><td width="90%">Breast: flat, not yet developed, no signs of abrasions nor hematoma noted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td>Abdomen: flat, soft, no organomegaly, no signs ofabrasion nor hematomas noted.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td>Genitalia: Normal external genitalia, nulliparous introitus, absence of pubic hair over mons pubis</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">"Internal Examination:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td>labia minora slightly protruding beyond labia majora</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td>prominent clitoris noted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td> hymen not intact</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td>absence of lacerations noted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td> vagina admits small finger with ease and one half of the length of the forefinger</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">-</td><td>no discharge nor blood upon withdrawal of the examining fingers"</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Explaining what could cause the conditions she noted on internal examination of the genitalia, Dr. Remonte mentioned several factors, namely, external manipulation or excessive physical exertion such as running or jumping, or falling on a hard object[,] and sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>The defense's sole witness was appellant Juan Cariñaga.<br><br>The Public Attorney summarized the defense's version as follows:<br><blockquote>Accused <b>Juan Cariñaga</b> branded the charges that he raped her [sic] daughter Venilda on November 23, 1998 and December 15, 1998 as pure fabrications. On November 23, 1998, he woke up early, around 3:00 to 4:00 o `clock in the morning, to accompany his wife to Centro, Poblacion, Ligao, Albay. On his way home, he fetched water for use at the house, then proceeded to tend to the plants. He went home only at around 11:00 in the morning.<br><br>On December 15, he was at Pandan, Ligao, Albay, together with his daughter Venilda, at the invitation of his "compadre," the godfather of' Venilda, Boy Gacad. They proceeded to the place after lunch and only returned home at past 8:00 o'clock p.m.<br><br>The accused surmised that the baseless fabrications may have been brought about by his wife's desire to get rid of him. Accordingly, Vitelina is having an affair with one Ariel Modestano and the two (2) were [sic] now living together at their residence.<br><br>The accused likewise branded the testimonies of his daughter[s], Venilda and Benilda, as tutored, they being instructed of what to say or declare in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>On rebuttal, Vetelina Cariñaga testified that it was on the 25th and not on the 15th of December 1998 that appellant went with Venilda to Boy Gacad's house. She also denied the existence of her alleged illicit relationship with Ariel Modestano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Bonga's Barangay Captain Edmundo Gomez, a sponsor during Vetelina and appellant's wedding, and Vetelina's employer Rosalie Cha, both testified that Vetelina is employed as a stay-in housemaid at Layon, Ligao, Albay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The trial court rendered a judgment of conviction on 14 September 2000. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in both Criminal Cases Nos. 3836 &amp; 3837 finding the accused Juan Cariñaga guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape committed against his 11-year old daughter Venilda Cariñaga and accordingly hereby sentences him to suffer twice (2x) the penalty of death and to indemnify the offended party the total amount of P150,000.00 and to pay another amount of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages and to pay the costs.<br><br>Let the records of these cases together with all the exhibits and transcript of stenographic notes be immediately elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>In this automatic review, appellant makes a lone assignment of error:<br><blockquote>THE COURT <i>A QUO </i>GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE DESPITE THE CLEAR INCONSISTENCIES IN THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PRINCIPAL WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION.</blockquote>The appeal has no merit. We agree with the trial court that the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt that appellant is guilty of the crime of rape.<br><br><i>First. </i>The trial court found the testimony of the prosecution witnesses credible and straightforward. Appellant, on the other hand, cites the following circumstances to support his assertion that the trial court erred in giving credence to the prosecution evidence:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">(a)</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Belinda Cariñaga, younger sister of Venilda, could not have vividly seen the incident on 23 November 1998. Belinda testified that appellant first put out the fluorescent lamp in the room before having sexual intercourse with Venilda;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(b)</td><td><p align="justify">Appellant could not have been so brazen in sexually abusing Venilda while Belinda was cooking rice in another corner of the house;</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(c)</td><td><div align="justify">Belinda testified that she informed her mother Vetelina about the rape incidents on the same days that they occurred, or on 23 November 1998 and 15 December 1998, respectively. However, Vetelina testified that she was informed of the incidents by Belinda on 22 January 1999; and</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(d)</td><td><div align="justify">The physical evidence failed to show with moral certainty that appellant sexually abused Venilda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Appellant quibbles on impertinent matters. What is material is that the commission of rape by appellant against Venilda is proven beyond any doubt. Discrepancies should refer to significant facts that are crucial to the guilt or innocence of an accused. Inconsistencies and discrepancies in details, which are irrelevant to the elements of the crime, are not grounds for acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Nevertheless, we shall still discuss the matters appellant has raised.<br><br>It is not hard to believe that Belinda, who was cooking rice in the kitchen, saw the rape incident at 5:00 in the early morning even if appellant put out the light in the room. This is just about the time when day breaks and darkness slowly fades to give way to light.<br><br>Belinda's testimony that there is also a kitchen in the house does not contradict Venilda's testimony that their house has only one room. It appears that only a partition separates the kitchen from the main room where the family slept. It is not really another room which has a door or is enclosed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, the circumstances of time and place do not affect the credibility of Belinda's eyewitness account. Rather, it corroborates Venilda's account.<br><br>Appellant asserts that he could not have raped Venilda in the presence of his other children. The presence of people has never deterred the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Rape is not a respecter of people, time or place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rape has been committed in places where people congregate, in parks, along roadsides, in school premises, in a house where there are other occupants, and even in places which to many would appear unlikely and high-risk venues for its commission. In any case, there is no rule that rape can be committed only in seclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>During the first incident, appellant timed his criminal act when it was still early morning. His wife had left the house and his brood of young children was still asleep, with the exception of Belinda whom he probably did not know was already awake.<br><br>The alleged contradiction between the testimonies of Belinda and her mother, as to when the former disclosed to the latter the rape incidents appellant committed against Venilda, is more apparent than real. Allowance must be given to some minor lapses or ambiguity in Belinda's testimony on the matter, as she was only ten years old when she testified in court. A reading of her entire testimony would show that immediately after Belinda told her mother about the rape incidents, her mother brought Venilda to the doctor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Her mother stated that Belinda made the disclosure on 22 January 1999. After hearing Belinda's disclosure, her mother brought Venilda to the doctor. Then her mother brought Venilda to the police station to file a complaint against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In any case, the alleged contradiction refers only to a minor matter that does not overrule the commission by appellant of the crime charged. Belinda's testimony is merely corroborative. Venilda's own testimony by itself is strong, convincing and credible, and thus suffices to sustain appellant's conviction.<br><br>Finally, appellant argues that the medical findings showing Venilda's hymen is no longer intact does not conclusively establish that it was due to sexual intercourse. He cites Dr. Lea Remonte's testimony that the rupture of the hymen could be caused by external manipulation, excessive physical exertion, running, or jumping, aside from sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The other factors mentioned by the doctor do not exclude Venilda's ruptured hymen as physical evidence of the sexual assault on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> When the victim's testimony of her sexual violation is corroborated by the physician's findings of penetration, i.e. a ruptured hymen, there is sufficient basis to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The trial court's evaluation of the testimony of a witness is accorded highest respect because the trial court had the direct and singular opportunity to observe the facial expression, gesture, and tone of voice of a witness while testifying. The trial court is uniquely positioned to determine whether a witness is telling the truth. We find no basis to deviate from the settled rule that the testimony of a rape victim of tender or immature age deserves full credit, as in this case where the facts establish the sexual assault on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The testimony given was simple and straightforward, unshaken by a rigid cross-examination and unflawed by any inconsistency or contradiction. The same must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Venilda testified thus:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">PROSECUTOR</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Now, on the said date and time, meaning November 23, 1998 at about 5:00 o'clock in the morning, where was your mother and your father?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>In Ligao, in the town.
