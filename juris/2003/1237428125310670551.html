Appellant held Monaliza by the waist and sucked her nipples. While she struggled to extricate herself, she failed. He then inserted his forefinger into her vagina which caused her pain. When she inquired why appellant "did that" to her, he replied that he was just "caressing."<br><br>At about midnight also of April 2, 1996, while Monaliza lay asleep on the floor of their house between her elder sister Marigilda who was 3 meters away from her and appellant who was a meter away from her, she woke up and found appellant on top of her and kissing her face. She struggled hard to free herself, but appellant held her tightly and inserted his sex organ into her vagina and made a "push and pull movement." On account of appellant's acts, she was in pain. He warned her, however, not to tell anyone about the incident, otherwise, he would kill them. Out of fear, she did not tell Marigilda about the incident.<br><br>A month and a half after the April 2, 1996 incident or on May 16, 1996, at noontime, appellant instructed Marigilda to, and the latter did, gather some firewood, leaving him and just Monaliza inside their house. Appellant soon approached Monaliza, "opened her dress," sucked her nipples, and inserted his penis into her vagina and made a "push and pull movement." As in the previous incident, she struggled to free herself but failed as he held her tightly. She was likewise in pain and was once again warned not to reveal the incident to anyone on pain of death.<br><br>Appellant's threats having overpowered her, Monaliza did not inform her mother about the incidents even after the latter came home from Manila on June 25, 1996 to attend the annual barangay fiesta.<br><br>As Monaliza later was observed to be always drowsy and weak, and her hips were expanding while her breasts became pronounced, she was prevailed upon by her mother and her aunt Jane "Ya Gen" Patiño to submit to a medical examination by Dr. Beverly R. Renacia, Medical Officer V of the Bais City Health Office. Monaliza ultimately revealed to Dr. Renacia, her mother and aunt "Ya Gen" that she had been raped by appellant.<br><br>The result of the external examination conducted on Monaliza on July 23, 1996 is reflected on the medical certificate issued by Dr. Renacia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> who likewise issued another medical certificate reflecting the following results of the internal examination conducted on July 25, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><blockquote>I.E.

Thus informed, appellant got mad at her for not priorly revealing the incident.<br><br>A few days later, thinking that Monaliza had influenza, he brought her to the hospital where she was examined and was given prescription for medicine.<br><br>After the lapse of two months or on May 1996, appellant observed that Monaliza was pale and vomiting. Suspecting that she was pregnant, he inquired if she was, but she did not answer. He then threatened her that if she was, he would kill her as her pregnancy would bring shame to the family. He did not, however, write his wife about his suspicions regarding Monaliza's condition as he knew that she would be coming home for the annual barangay fiesta of Olympia.<br><br>While his wife went home for the barangay fiesta, he failed to inform her of his suspicions about Monaliza's pregnancy as he was occupied with the fiesta. It was his wife, however, who broached to him her own suspicion that Monaliza was pregnant. And his wife brought Monaliza to a <i>hilot</i> who opined that she was probably pregnant, hence, the latter was brought to the hospital for medical examination.<br><br>On top of appellant's denial, he advanced that he could not have raped Monaliza on April 2, 1996 and May 16, 1996 as he was, on the first date with his brother-in-law, one Danny, constructing a house,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> while he was "working" with a certain Kalaw, Danny, and one Ete on the latter date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finding for the prosecution, the trial court convicted appellant of two counts of qualified rape and sentenced him to death in both cases in its November 17, 2000 Joint Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads, quoted <b><i>verbatim</i></b>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, this Court finds accused, <b>ROLANDO MENDOZA (sic) Y DE LA CRUZ</b> guilty for the qualified crime of rape in two (2) counts under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Sec. 11 of Republic Act No. 7659, and thereby <b>sentences him to two (2) extreme and supreme penalties of DEATH, and to pay moral damages of P50,000.00 and exemplary damages to the victim, Mona Liza Mendoza, and to pay costs</b>.

Adora</i>, this Court held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>[A]uthorities in forensic medicine agree that the determination of the exact date of fertilization is problematic. The exact date thereof is unknown; thus, the difficulty in determining the actual normal duration of pregnancy. A Filipino authority writes:<br><blockquote>"The average duration of pregnancy is 270 to 280 days from the onset of the last menstruation. There is however no means of determining it with certainty. Evidence derived from pregnancy following a single coitus is trustworthy, but inasmuch as some authorities consider more than two weeks as the life span of the spermatozoa in the vagina canal, it is hard to ascertain the exact date of fertilization. There is no synchrony between coitus and fertilization."</blockquote>Computation of the whole period of gestation, thus, becomes a purely academic endeavor. In this light, while most authorities would agree on an average duration, <u>there are still cases of long and short gestations.</u><br><blockquote>"Thus, <u>the stage of development of the fetus cannot be determined with any exactitude,</u> and an error of at least two weeks, if not more, should be allowed for. This, together with the recognized variation in the duration of normal pregnancies, makes it very unsafe to dogmatize in a medico-legal case xxx."</blockquote>More importantly, it should be pointed out that <u>these consolidated cases are criminal cases for rape, not civil actions for paternity or filiation.</u> <b>The identity of the father of the victim's child is a non-issue. Even her pregnancy is beside the point. <u>What matters is the occurrence of the sexual assault committed by appellant on the person of the victim</u> </b>on four separate occasions<b> . . . </b> (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>This ruling on the computation of the whole period of gestation was reiterated in <i>People v. Bation.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As for the failure of Monaliza to immediately report the incidents, this does not dent her credibility nor undermine the charges. It bears noting that appellant threatened to kill "all of them" if Monaliza reported what had transpired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As is a common occurrence, a young and immature girl usually conceals for a time the rape committed on her because of the rapist's threats on her life, more so when the offender is living with her. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The gravamen of the offense of rape as defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will or without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, the prosecution must prove that (1) <u>the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman;</u> and (2) <u>such act was accomplished through the use of force or intimidation;</u> or when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the victim is twelve (12) years of age, or is demented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>By the very nature of the crime of rape, conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony, given the fact that usually only the participants can testify as to its occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The following extract from Monaliza's

As in the first incident, appellant during the second incident held Monaliza tightly to prevent her from setting herself free as she tried to resist appellant's acts. And in both incidents, he repeatedly warned her against confiding to anyone what had transpired.<br><br>That Monaliza could not offer a more tenacious resistance could be explained by the fact that appellant was simply too strong for her. Her resistance, however, clearly negates consent.<br><br>Monaliza's pointing to appellant as the one who raped her twice undermines his denial. Denial being intrinsically weak as a defense, it must be supported by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This appellant failed to do.<br><br>As between the positive and categorical testimony then of Monaliza that she was raped by appellant and the latter's bare denial, the former prevails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As for appellant's alibi, it is weak as it can easily be fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> And that explains why, for it to prosper, two (2) elements must <b>concur</b>: (a) his presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the offense must be proven; <b>and</b> (b) the physical impossibility for him to be at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Proof of these appellant failed to discharge.<br><br>If any nagging doubts about appellant's culpability still linger, his leaving for Iloilo, upon learning of the filing of the present charges in court and the issuance of warrants for his arrest, thereby frustrating the service thereof and calling for the issuance of alias warrants,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> should dissipate them. Appellant's explanation - that he went to Iloilo to look for his son Reynaldo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> - leaves this Court unbelieving. For a truly innocent person would normally seize the first available opportunity to defend himself and assert his innocence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> His flight certainly strongly indicates his guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues, at all events, that assuming <i>arguendo</i> that he is guilty, the trial court erred in imposing death on him since the prosecution failed to allege the minority of Monaliza in the accusatory portion of each of the complaints. Appellant's position in this regard is well-taken.<br><br>Monaliza's age at the time of the filing of the complaints appears in the caption or preamble thereof as a <b>description of her as the private complainant</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Her age at the time the incidents occurred was, however, not specified in the accusatory portion of each of the complaints. Such omission is prejudicial to the right of appellant to be informed of the nature of the accusations against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, in several cases, this Court held that it is not sufficient to simply allege the qualifying circumstances in the caption or the preamble but, more importantly, these must be alleged in the body or the accusatory portion of the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote><b>It has been held that "the real nature of the criminal charge is determined not from the caption or the preamble of the information nor from the specification of the provision of law alleged to have been violated . . . but from the actual recital of the facts as alleged in the body of the information.</b> In this case the information upon which the appellant was arraigned does not state in the specification of the acts constitutive of the offense that he is charged as the live-in partner of the mother of the alleged victim. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This insufficiency prevents a judgment of conviction for qualified rape and thus, the death penalty cannot be imposed.</span> (<i>People v.

The complaint alleged that he is the father of Monaliza. Monaliza testified that appellant is her father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> And appellant admitted during the pre-trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and the trial<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> that he is Monaliza's father.
