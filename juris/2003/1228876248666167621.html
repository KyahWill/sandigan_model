				<BR><BR><div align="justify">As a rule, labor arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission have no power or authority to grant reliefs from claims that do not arise from employer-employee relations. They have no jurisdiction over torts that have no reasonable causal connection to any of the claims provided for in the Labor Code, other labor statutes, or collective bargaining agreements.<br><b><u><center><br><u>The Case</u></center></u></b><br>The Petition for Review before us assails the April 18, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 57660, as well as the April 17, 2001 CA Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> denying petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration. The dispositive portion of the challenged Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition for certiorari is hereby <b>DENIED</b> and accordingly <b>DISMISSED</b>, without prejudice to the right of herein petitioner to file a suit before the proper court, if she so desires. No pronouncement as to costs.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><b><u><center><u>The Facts</u></center></u></b><br>The appellate court narrated the facts of the case in this manner:<br><blockquote>“Evelyn Tolosa (hereafter EVELYN), was the widow of Captain Virgilio Tolosa (hereafter CAPT. TOLOSA) who was hired by Qwana-Kaiun, through its manning agent, Asia Bulk Transport Phils. Inc., (ASIA BULK for brevity), to be the master of the Vessel named M/V Lady Dona. CAPT. TOLOSA had a monthly compensation of US$1700, plus US$400.00 monthly overtime allowance. His contract officially began on November 1, 1992, as supported by his contract of employment when he assumed command of the vessel in Yokohama, Japan. The vessel departed for Long Beach California, passing by Hawaii in the middle of the voyage. At the time of embarkation, CAPT. TOLOSA was allegedly shown to be in good health.<br><br>“During ‘channeling activities’ upon the vessel’s departure from Yokohama sometime on November 6, 1992, CAPT. TOLOSA was drenched with rainwater. The following day, November 7, 1992, he had a slight fever and in the succeeding twelve (12) days, his health rapidly deteriorated resulting in his death on November 18, 1992.<br><br>“According to Pedro Garate, Chief Mate of the Vessel, in his statement submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard on November 23, 1992 upon arrival in Long Beach, California CAPT. TOLOSA experienced high fever between November 11-15, 1992 and suffered from loose bowel movement (LBM) beginning November 9, 1992. By November 11, 1992, his temperature was 39.5 although his LBM had ‘slightly’ stopped. The next day, his temperature rose to 39.8 and had lost his appetite. In the evening of that day, November 13, 1992, he slipped in the toilet and suffered scratches at the back of his waist. First aid was applied and CAPT. TOLOSA was henceforth confined to his quarters with an able seaman to watch him 24 hours a day until November 15, 1992, when his conditioned worsened.<br><br>“On the same day, November 15, 1992, the Chief Engineer initiated the move and contacted ASIA BULK which left CAPT. TOLOSA’s fate in the hands of Pedro Garate and Mario Asis, Second Mate of the same vessel who was in-charge of the primary medical care of its officers and crew. Contact with the U.S. Coast Guard in Honolulu, Hawaii (USCGHH) was likewise initiated to seek medical advice.<br><br>“On November 17, 1992, CAPT. TOLOSA was ‘losing resistance’ and his ‘condition was getting serious.’ At 2215 GMT, a telex was sent to ASIA BULK requesting for the immediate evacuation of CAPT. TOLOSA and thereafter an airlift was set on November 19, 1992. However, on November 18, 1992, at 0753 GMT, CAPT. TOLOSA was officially recorded as having breathed his last.<br><br>“Because of the death of CAPT. TOLOSA, his wife, EVELYN, as petitioner, filed a Complaint/Position Paper before the POEA (POEA Case No. 93-06-1080) against Qwana-Kaiun, thru its resident-agent, Mr. Fumio Nakagawa, ASIA BULK, Pedro Garate and Mario Asis, as respondents.<br><br>“After initial hearings and submissions of pleadings, the case was however transferred to the Department of Labor and Employment, National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), when the amendatory legislation expanding its jurisdiction, and removing overseas employment related claims from the ambit of POEA jurisdiction. The case was then raffled to Labor Arbiter, Vladimir Sampang.<br><center><br>x x x                                     x x x                                      x x x</center><br>“After considering the pleadings and evidences, on July 8, 1997, the Labor Arbiter Vladimir P. L. Sampang, in conformity with petitioner’s plea to hold respondents solidarily liable, granted all the damages, (plus legal interest), as prayed for by the petitioner. The dispositive portion of his Decision reads:<br><blockquote>‘WHEREFORE, premises considered, the respondents are hereby ordered to jointly and solidarily pay complainants the following:<br><ol type="1"><li> US$176,400.00 (US$2,100.00 x 12 months x 7 years) or P4,586,400.00 (at P26.00 per US$1.00) by way of lost income;<br><br></li><li> interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum or P1,238,328.00 (from November 1992 to May 1997 or 4 ½ years);<br><br></li><li> moral damages of P200,000.00;<br><br></li><li> exemplary damages of P100,000.00; and<br><br></li><li> 10% of the total award, or P612,472.80, as attorney’s fees.’<br></li></ol></blockquote><center>x x x                          x x x                         x x x</center><br>“On appeal, private respondents raised before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) the following grounds:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="85%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td valign="top">(a)</td><td width="85%">the action before the Arbiter, as he himself concedes, is a complaint based on torts due to negligence.

Her cause did not arise from an employer-employee relation, but from a quasi delict or tort. Further, there is no reasonable causal connection between her suit for damages and her claim under Article 217 (a)(4) of the Labor Code, which allows an award of damages incident to an employer-employee relation.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><b><u><center><br><u>Issues</u></center></u></b><br>Petitioner raises the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><center>“I</center><br>“Whether or not the NLRC has jurisdiction over the case.<br><center><br>“II</center><br>“Whether or not Evelyn is entitled to the monetary awards granted by the labor arbiter.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>After reviewing petitioner’s Memorandum, we find that we are specifically being asked to determine 1) whether the labor arbiter and the NLRC had jurisdiction over petitioner’s action, and 2) whether the monetary award granted by the labor arbiter has already reached finality.<br><b><u><center><br><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></center></u></b><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><center><br><b><u>First Issue:<br><i>Jurisdiction over the Action</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioner argues that her cause of action is not predicated on a quasi delict or tort, but on the failure of private respondents -- as employers of her husband (Captain Tolosa) -- to provide him with timely, adequate and competent medical services under Article 161 of the Labor Code:<br><blockquote>“ART 161. Assistance of employer. -- It shall be the duty of any employer to provide all the necessary assistance to ensure the adequate and immediate medical and dental attendance and treatment to an injured or sick employee in case of emergency.”<br></blockquote>Likewise, she contends that Article 217 (a) (4)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the Labor Code vests labor arbiters and the NLRC with jurisdiction to award all kinds of damages in cases arising from employer-employee relations.<br><br>Petitioner also alleges that the “reasonable causal connection” rule should be applied in her favor. Citing <i>San Miguel Corporation v. Etcuban</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> she insists that a reasonable causal connection between the claim asserted and the employer-employee relation confers jurisdiction upon labor tribunals. She adds that she has satisfied the required conditions: 1) the dispute arose from an employer-employee relation, considering that the claim was for damages based on the failure of private respondents to comply with their obligation under Article 161 of the Labor Code; and 2) the dispute can be resolved by reference to the Labor Code, because the material issue is whether private respondents complied with their legal obligation to provide timely, adequate and competent medical services to guarantee Captain Tolosa’s occupational safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>We disagree. We affirm the CA’s ruling that the NLRC and the labor arbiter had no jurisdiction over petitioner’s claim for damages, because that ruling was based on a quasi delict or tort per Article 2176 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Time and time again, we have held that the allegations in the complaint determine the nature of the action and, consequently, the jurisdiction of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> After carefully examining the complaint/position paper of petitioner, we are convinced that the allegations therein are in the nature of an action based on a quasi delict or tort. It is evident that she sued Pedro Garate and Mario Asis for gross negligence.<br><br>Petitioner’s complaint/position paper refers to and extensively discusses the negligent acts of shipmates Garate and Asis, who had no employer-employee relation with Captain Tolosa. Specifically, the paper alleges the following tortious acts:<br><blockquote>“x x x [R]espondent Asis was the medical officer of the Vessel, who failed to regularly monitor Capt. Tolosa’s condition, and who needed the USCG to prod him to take the latter’s vital signs. In fact, he failed to keep a medical record, like a patient’s card or folder, of Capt. Tolosa’s illness.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>“Respondents, however, failed Capt. Tolosa because Garate never initiated actions to save him. x x x In fact, Garate rarely checked personally on Capt. Tolosa’s condition, to wit:”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>“x x x Noticeably, the History (Annex “D”) fails to mention any instance when Garate consulted the other officers, much less Capt. Tolosa, regarding the possibility of deviation. To save Capt. Tolosa’s life was surely a just cause for the change in course, which the other officers would have concurred in had they been consulted by respondent Garate – which he grossly neglected to do.<br><br>“Garate’s poor judgement, since he was the officer effectively in command of the vessel, prevented him from undertaking these emergency measures, the neglect of which resulted in Capt. Tolosa’s untimely demise.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The labor arbiter himself classified petitioner’s case as “a complaint for damages, blacklisting and watchlisting (pending inquiry) for gross negligence resulting in the death of complainant’s husband, Capt. Virgilio Tolosa.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>We stress that the case does not involve the adjudication of a labor dispute, but the recovery of damages based on a quasi delict. The jurisdiction of labor tribunals is limited to disputes arising from employer-employee relations, as we ruled in <i>Georg Grotjahn GMBH &amp; Co. v. Isnani:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><blockquote>“Not every dispute between an employer and employee involves matters that only labor arbiters and the NLRC can resolve in the exercise of their adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers. The jurisdiction of labor arbiters and the NLRC under Article 217 of the Labor Code is limited to disputes arising from an employer-employee relationship which can only be resolved by reference to the Labor Code, other labor statutes, or their collective bargaining agreement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>The pivotal question is whether the Labor Code has any relevance to the relief sought by petitioner. From her paper, it is evident that the primary reliefs she seeks are as follows: (a) loss of earning capacity denominated therein as “actual damages” or “lost income” and (b) blacklisting. The loss she claims does not refer to the actual earnings of the deceased, but to his earning capacity based on a life expectancy of 65 years. This amount is recoverable if the action is based on a quasi delict as provided for in Article 2206 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> but not in the Labor Code.<br><br>While it is true that labor arbiters and the NLRC have jurisdiction to award not only reliefs provided by labor laws, but also damages governed by the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> these reliefs must still be based on an action that has a reasonable causal connection with the Labor Code, other labor statutes, or collective bargaining agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The central issue is determined essentially from the relief sought in the complaint. In <i>San Miguel Corporation v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>“It is the character of the <i>principal relief</i> sought that appears essential in this connection. Where such <i>principal relief</i> is to be granted under labor legislation or a collective bargaining agreement, the case should fall within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, even though a claim for damages might be asserted as an incident to such claim.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The labor arbiter found private respondents to be grossly negligent. He ruled that Captain Tolosa, who died at age 58, could expect to live up to 65 years and to have an earning capacity of US$176,400.<br><br>It must be noted that a worker’s loss of earning capacity and blacklisting are not to be equated with wages, overtime compensation or separation pay, and other labor benefits that are generally cognized in labor disputes. The loss of earning capacity is a relief or claim resulting from a quasi delict or a similar cause within the realm of civil law.<br><br>“Claims for damages under paragraph 4 of Article 217 must have a reasonable causal connection with any of the claims provided for in the article in order to be cognizable by the labor arbiter. Only if there is such a connection with the other claims can the claim for damages be considered as arising from employer-employee relations.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the present case, petitioner’s claim for damages is not related to any other claim under Article 217, other labor statutes, or collective bargaining agreements.<br><br>Petitioner cannot anchor her claim for damages to Article 161 of the Labor Code, which does not grant or specify a claim or relief. This provision is only a safety and health standard under Book IV of the same Code. The enforcement of this labor standard rests with the labor secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, claims for an employer’s violation thereof are beyond the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter. In other words, petitioner cannot enforce the labor standard provided for in Article 161 by suing for damages before the labor arbiter.<br><br>It is not the NLRC but the regular courts that have jurisdiction over actions for damages, in which the employer-employee relation is merely incidental, and in which the cause of action proceeds from a different source of obligation such as a tort. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Since petitioner’s claim for damages is predicated on a quasi delict or tort that has no reasonable causal connection with any of the claims provided for in Article 217, other labor statutes, or collective bargaining agreements, jurisdiction over the action lies with the regular courts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> -- not with the NLRC or the labor arbiters.<br><center><br><b><u>Second Issue:<br><i>Finality of the Monetary Award</i></u></b></center><br>Petitioner contends that the labor arbiter’s monetary award has already reached finality, since private respondents were not able to file a timely appeal before the NLRC.<br><br>This argument cannot be passed upon in this appeal, because it was not raised in the tribunals <i>a quo</i>. Well-settled is the rule that issues not raised below cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Thus, points of law, theories, and arguments not brought to the attention of the Court of Appeals need not -- and ordinarily will not -- be considered by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Petitioner’s allegation cannot be accepted by this Court on its face; to do so would be tantamount to a denial of respondents’ right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, whether respondents were able to appeal on time is a question of fact that cannot be entertained in a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. In general, the jurisdiction of this Court in cases brought before it from the Court of Appeals is limited to a review of errors of law allegedly committed by the court <i>a quo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <b><i>DENIED,</i></b> and the assailed Decision and Resolution <b><i>AFFIRMED.</i></b> Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona</i>, and <i>Carpio Morales, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Justice Mercedes Gozo-Dadole, with the concurrence of Justices Fermin A.
