With them were Honoria Ontanillas and Nestor Jamias.&nbsp; The group was talking animatedly concerning the deployment abroad of Honorio Ontanillas as well as Crisanto's deployment on the last week of that month of August. In the course of their conversation, two (2) masked intruders suddenly appeared from the door.&nbsp; One of the intruders pointed a gun at the temple of Crisanto — then a shot rang out.&nbsp; Crisanto slumped on the floor.&nbsp; Evelyn was shoved inside a room by Aniceto Jamias and a scuffle ensued between the second intruder and the rest of the group of the Jamiases.&nbsp; The second intruder was subdued.&nbsp; Evelyn vividly recalled that the gunman who shot her husband had the letter `M' tattooed between his thumb and forefinger.<br><br>"Post mortem examination conducted on the corpse of Crisanto Saul showed that the cause of his death was penetrating gunshot wound, left eye."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote><i><center><b><u>Version of the Defense</u></b></center></i><br>Appellant, on the other hand, relates his version of the facts simply as follows: <br><blockquote>"Accused Michael Maguing interposed the defense of alibi.&nbsp; He testified that on August 12, 1993, he together with a certain Alex, Tetet and Dante were in the house of his uncle, Reynaldo Tanco, doing some repair works. They started working at 8:00 o'clock in the morning and finished their job at 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon. Thereafter, they engaged in a drinking session until 7:30 in the evening.&nbsp; They then took their dinner and watched television.&nbsp; After his companions left, he stayed in the house of his uncle.<br><br>"The foregoing testimony of the accused was corroborated by Reynaldo Tanco and Alex Agustin."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The trial court found the evidence for the prosecution sufficient to establish appellant's criminal liability for murder.&nbsp; It gave full credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses — especially the wife of the victim.&nbsp; She was allegedly able to see the actual shooting and to identify the assailant through the tattoo mark on his right hand.<b></b><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><u><b><center>The Issues</center></b></u><br>In his Brief, appellant raises the following alleged errors for our consideration:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>The trial court erred in rendering a verdict of conviction despite the fact that the identification of the accused-appellant as the alleged perpetrator of the offense charged was not clear, positive and convincing.<br><br><center>"II</center><br>The trial court erred in giving credence to the incredible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and in disregarding the evidence adduced by the accused-appellant which was corroborated on material points.<br><br><center>"III<br><br></center>The trial court erred in convicting the accused-appellant of the crime charged notwithstanding the fact that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center>"IV</center><br>On the assumption that the accused-appellant is guilty, the trial court erred in convicting him of murder instead of homicide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Simply stated, the main issue is the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br><center><b><u>Main Issue:</u></b></center><i><u><b><center>Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</center></b></u></i><br><br><i><b><u>Positive Identification Required</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>to Sustain a Conviction</b></u> </i><br><br>In every criminal prosecution, the prosecution must prove two things: (1) the commission of the crime and (2) the identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Cursory identification does not suffice to convict the accused.&nbsp; What is needed is positive identification made with moral certainty as to the person of the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Verily, the critical consideration in this appeal is whether the identity of the assailant was sufficiently established by the prosecution. &nbsp;<br><br>At the outset it must be noted that the assailants wore masks, which completely covered their faces during the entire course of the shooting.&nbsp; The prosecution never denied this vital piece of information at any stage of the proceedings.&nbsp; Further, even the trial court took cognizance of this fact.&nbsp; Given this factual premise, the prosecution had the task of showing that one of the masked assailants and appellant were one and the same person.&nbsp; Regrettably, it failed to discharge this task. &nbsp;<br><br><i><b><u>Masked Man</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>Unrecognized by Witnesses</b></u></i><br><br><i>First</i>, not having had any chance at all to see the face of the masked gunman, none of the eyewitnesses was able to recognize or give a definite description of him later on. Thus, their act of positively pointing to the accused as the assailant during the police lineup and the trial was the result of pure speculation and was contrary to human knowledge and common experience.<br><br>In recent cases, this Court has upheld the validity of the identification of&nbsp; masked assailants by prosecution witnesses,&nbsp; but only because of peculiar circumstances that served as reliable bases for pointing to the accused as the culprits. &nbsp;<br><br>In <i>People v. Mante,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><i> </i>the accused was convicted because the yellow <i>sando</i> (undershirt), which he had used to mask his face, was the same apparel he was wearing when he was seen by witnesses in the vicinity of the crime scene prior to the killing.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Nang,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> appellants were deemed to have been positively identified, because the mask&nbsp; worn&nbsp; by&nbsp; one of them accidentally dropped from his face in the course of a struggle with the victim.&nbsp; In the same vein, we ruled in <i>People v. Sotto</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that the prosecution witness had positively identified the masked assailant, because the two of them were previously known to each other.&nbsp; The witness was therefore familiar with the body contour and movements of the accused. Moreover, the gun used in the shooting belonged to the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp; He also tested positive for powder burns after undergoing a paraffin test.<br><br>Indubitably, the identification of the accused in the aforecited cases was based on significant facts and on circumstantial evidence other than the prosecution witnesses' self-serving declarations or statements. &nbsp;<br><br>In the present case, it was not established that the prosecution witnesses had previously known appellant or were familiar with his voice, gestures and mannerisms.&nbsp; Neither was it shown that the mask he was wearing was dislodged from his face, so as to allow thereby a reasonable view or even a slight glimpse of his facial features. &nbsp;<br><br><b><u><i>Unreliable Basis<br>for Identification</i></u></b><br><br><i>Second</i>, the prosecution's basis for identifying the assailant was belatedly established, unsubstantiated, uncorroborated and therefore unreliable.<br><br>From the testimony of Prosecution Witness Evelyn Saul, it is clear that in identifying the assailant, her only point of reference was the tattoo on his right hand.&nbsp; Nonetheless, she audaciously declared that she was able to recognize the assailant, who was wearing a mask the whole time, as herein appellant.&nbsp; She testified as follows: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q: </td> <td width="90%">So, there were 5 persons present [on] x x x August <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 1993 at 11:30 P.M.?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Yes, [ma'am]. </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>What were you and your husband doing at the residence of Mrs. Angelita Jamias?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>We were talking because her cousin has just had a medical examination and he was about to leave on that coming Saturday while my husband [was] going to leave on the last week of August.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>So, what this group, you and your husband and Mrs. Jamias and a brother of Mrs. Jamias and who else?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Honorio.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q:</td> <td><p> Is he also with your group?<br> </p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Yes, [ma'am].</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>Cousin Honorio Ontanillas did anything unusual happen?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>While we were talking then suddenly entered two armed men.

The initial investigation was conducted on August 13, 1993, or the day following the shooting incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; During both investigations, particularly during a police lineup, she pointed to appellant&nbsp; as&nbsp; the&nbsp; killer. Surprisingly,&nbsp; she&nbsp; made no reference to any tattoo or identification mark on his person during either of these investigations. It was only in open court that she mentioned the tattoo for the first time. &nbsp;<br><br>We find it strange why in her Sworn Testimony taken only a few days after the killing, this witness did not even refer to any supposedly noticeable identification mark or tattoo on the gunman.&nbsp; Neither did she disclose the fact that the assailant was wearing a mask.&nbsp; It seems that she deliberately omitted this information to make it appear that she had a clear and positive view of the killer. &nbsp;<br><br>Verily, it is baffling why the information about the tattoo was completely disregarded in the Sworn Testimony, only to be used during trial as the sole determining factor to establish the identity of the killer.&nbsp; The material omissions therein gravely affect her credibility as to her identification of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> &nbsp;<br><br>It is beyond comprehension how she could have failed to mention an important factual detail such as the tattoo, especially in the initial stages of the investigation, when she knew that it was the only means by which her identification of the assailant could be substantiated.&nbsp; We cannot repeat often enough that for evidence to be believed, it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but must itself be credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, it must also be reasonable and in accord with human experience; failing to be so, it must be rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> &nbsp;<br><br><i><b><u>Discrepancies and Inconsistencies</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>in the Testimonies of Witnesses</b></u></i><br><br><i>Third</i>, the eyewitness testimonies as to the identification of appellant are replete with irreconcilable inconsistencies and inherent improbabilities pertaining to material facts. When they contradict themselves on a vital question such as the identity of the offender, the element of reasonable doubt is injected and cannot be lightly disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, their credibility is seriously impaired,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the veracity of their claim is negated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and their probative value greatly diminished — if not rendered useless altogether. On the whole, the impression they create is that they were feigned or fabricated. &nbsp;<br><br>While Evelyn spoke much of the supposedly ostentatious tattoo on the assailant's hand, nowhere in the testimony of the corroborating witnesses was there any mention of it.&nbsp; In fact, Prosecution Witness Angelita Jamias, who was also present during the shooting, denied having seen it, much less the person who had shot the victim.<br><br>This denial notwithstanding, Angelita conveniently and casually pointed to appellant as the killer, even as she admitted her inability to recognize him then.&nbsp; Moreover, contrary to Evelyn's narration, her claim was that she saw three killers instead of just two.&nbsp; She testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q: </td> <td width="90%">And on the evening at 11:30, you said [that] there were persons who entered, who came in first?

Instead of so doing, she exhibited a disposition to fabricate that makes her testimony unworthy of belief and credence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote>By and large, the only piece of evidence linking appellant to the crime is the tattoo, which one of the eyewitnesses claimed was identical to the one she had seen on the assailant's right hand.&nbsp; As explained above, such testimony hardly serves as reliable basis for identifying the assailant.&nbsp; Thus, the trial court's conviction based on the uncorroborated claim of Evelyn Saul — that she recognized appellant as the assailant by the tattoo on his right hand — must be regarded as erroneous and set aside.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>When the records are bereft of any indication that an eyewitness has given a description that will enable an anonymous person to point to the accused as the perpetrator of the crime, the court cannot judge whether a correct and proper identification has been made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <br><br>To be sure, the identification of appellant as the assailant in this case cannot in any way be considered positive and credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; It is a settled rule that when the identification is doubtful, inconclusive or unreliable, an acquittal is called for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The doubtful identification of the accused herein, when taken with the absence of any other evidence showing his guilt, justifies his acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><i><b><u>When Positive Identification</u></b></i><br><i><u><b>Does Not Prevail Over Alibi</b></u></i><br><br>In passing, we shall discuss the jurisprudential rule regarding the defense&nbsp; of&nbsp; alibi&nbsp; <i>vis-à-vis</i>&nbsp; the positive&nbsp; identification made by a credible witness.&nbsp; Although such defense is inherently weak, the prosecution is not released from its burden of establishing the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; More important, before a court can apply the rule that positive identification prevails over alibi, it is necessary to first establish beyond question the credibility of the eyewitness as to the identification&nbsp; of&nbsp; the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the&nbsp; present case, such credibility was not established.&nbsp; Hence, there can be no positive identification to speak of, and no application of the aforementioned rule. <br><br>The defense of alibi becomes irrelevant when the prosecution fails to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; A conviction for the crime of murder cannot be based on the appellant's inherently weak defenses of denial and alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; Rather, guilt should be premised on the strength of the prosecution's evidence.<br><blockquote>"While the defenses of denial and alibi are concededly weak, appellant's conviction cannot be based thereon.&nbsp; It is a well-settled doctrine that it is incumbent upon the prosecution to uphold the People's cause based on the strength of its own evidence on the guilt of the accused.&nbsp; The burden of proof is on the prosecution to show to the court to the point of moral certainty that the accused indeed committed the offense charged.
