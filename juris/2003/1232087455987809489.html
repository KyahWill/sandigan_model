				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On complaint of AAA, accused-appellant Ronnie Rullepa <span style="font-style: italic;">y </span>Guinto was charged with Rape before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 17<sup>th </sup>day of November, 1995, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, to wit: by then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously removing her panty, kissing her lips and vagina and thereafter rubbing his penis and inserting the same to the inner portion of the vagina of the undersigned complainant, 3 years of age, a minor, against her will and without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>Arraigned on January 15, 1996, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>From the testimonies of its witnesses, namely AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> her mother <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria Francisco Buenafe</span>, Dr. Cristina V.

Pursuing, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> asked AAA what else he did to her, and AAA indicated the room where accused-appellant slept and pointed at his pillow.<br><br>As on the night of November 20, 1995 accused-appellant was out with <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria’s</span> husband Col. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buenafe</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> she waited until their arrival at past 11:00 p.m. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> then sent accused-appellant out on an errand and informed her husband about their daughter’s plaint. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buenafe</span> thereupon talked to AAA who repeated what she had earlier told her mother <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span>.<br><br>When accused-appellant returned, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buenafe</span> and <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> verified from him whether what AAA had told them was true. Ronnie readily admitted doing those things but only once, at 4:00 p.m. of November 17, 1995 or three days earlier. Unable to contain her anger, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> slapped accused-appellant several times.<br><br>Since it was already midnight, the spouses waited until the following morning to bring accused-appellant to Camp Karingal where he admitted the imputations against him, on account of which he was detained. <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria’s</span> sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was then taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Recalling what accused-appellant did to her, AAA declared at the witness stand: “<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinaksak nya ang titi sa pepe ko, sa puwit ko, at sa bunganga</span>,” thus causing her pain and drawing her to cry. She added that accused-appellant did these to her twice in his bedroom.<br><br>Dr. Ma. Cristina V. Preyra, the Medico-Legal Officer and Chief of the Biological Science Branch of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory who examined Crya May, came up with her report dated November 21, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> containing the following findings and conclusions:<br><blockquote>FINDINGS:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL AND EXTRA GENITAL:</span><br><br>Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female child subject. Breasts are undeveloped. Abdomen is flat and soft.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENITAL</span>:<br><br>There is absence of pubic hair. Labia majora are full, convex and coaptated with <span style="font-weight: bold;">congested and abraded labia minora presenting in between</span>. On separating the same is disclosed an abraded posterior fourchette and an elastic, fleshy type intact hymen. External vaginal orifice does not admit the tip of the examining index finger.<br><br>x x x<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Subject is in virgin state physically.<br></blockquote>There are no external signs of recent application of any form of trauma at the time of examination. (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br>By Dr. Preyra’s explanation, the abrasions on the <span style="font-style: italic;">labia minora</span> could have been caused by friction with an object, perhaps an erect penis. She doubted if riding on a bicycle had caused the injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The defense’s sole witness was accused-appellant, who was 28 and single at the time he took the witness stand on June 9, 1997. He denied having anything to do with the abrasions found in AAA’s genitalia, and claimed that prior to the alleged incident, he used to be ordered to buy medicine for AAA who had difficulty urinating. He further alleged that after he refused to answer <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria’s</span> queries if her husband <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buenafe</span>, whom he usually accompanied whenever he went out of the house, was womanizing, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> would always find fault in him. He suggested that <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> was behind the filing of the complaint.

Indeed, according to the mother, the admission was even expressly <span style="font-style: italic;">qualified</span> by Rullepa’s insistence that he had committed the sexual assault <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only once</span>, specifying the time thereof as 4:00 <span style="font-style: italic;">pm</span> of November 17, 1995. That qualification proved that the admission was voluntary and true. An uncoerced and truthful admission like this should be absolutely admissible and competent.<br><br>x x x<br><br>Remarkably, the admission was not denied by the accused during trial despite his freedom to deny it if untrue. Hence, the admission became conclusive upon him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>To accused-appellant, the statements attributed to him are inadmissible since they were made out of fear, having been elicited only after AAA’s parents “bullied and questioned him.” He thus submits that it was error for the trial court to take his failure to deny the statements during the trial as an admission of guilt.<br><br>Accused-appellant’s submission does not persuade. The trial court considered his admission merely as an <span style="font-weight: bold;">additional</span> ground to convince itself of his culpability. Even if such admission, as well as the implication of his failure to deny the same, were disregarded, the evidence suffices to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>The plain, matter-of-fact manner by which AAA described her abuse in the hands of her <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuya</span> Ronnie is an eloquent testament to the truth of her accusations.

In any event, a young child is vulnerable to suggestion, hence, her affirmative response to the defense counsel’s above-quoted <span style="font-weight: bold;">leading</span> questions.<br><br>As for the variance in the claim regarding when <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> was informed of the rape, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> having testified that she learned of it on November 20, 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> while AAA said that immediately after the incident, she awakened her mother who was in the adjacent room and reported it:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This is a minor matter that does not detract from AAA’s categorical, material testimony that accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vagina.<br><br>Accused-appellant goes on to contend that AAA was coached, citing the following portion of her testimony:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top"><div align="left">q-</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">“Yong sinabi mong sinira nya ang buhay mo,” where did you get that phrase? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">a- </div></td> <td><div align="justify">It was the word of my Mama, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On the contrary, the foregoing testimony indicates that AAA was really narrating the truth, that of hearing her mother utter “<span style="font-style: italic;">sinira niya ang buhay mo</span>.”<br><br>Accused-appellant’s suggestion that AAA merely imagined the things of which he is accused, perhaps getting the idea from television programs, is preposterous. It is true that “the ordinary child is a ‘great weaver of romances,’’’ and her “imagination may induce (her) to relate something she has heard or read in a story as personal experience.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> But AAA’s account is hardly the stuff of romance or fairy tales. Neither is it normal TV fare, if at all.<br><br>This Court cannot believe that a victim of AAA’s age could concoct a tale of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts, and undergo the expense, trouble, inconvenience, not to mention the trauma of public trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Besides, her testimony is corroborated by the findings of Dr. Preyra that there were abrasions in her <span style="font-style: italic;">labia minora</span>, which she opined, could have been caused by friction with an erect penis.<br><br>This Court thus accords great weight to the following assessment of the trial court regarding the competency and credibility of AAA as a witness:<br><blockquote>Her very tender age notwithstanding, AAA nonetheless appeared to possess the necessary intelligence and perceptiveness sufficient to invest her with the competence to testify about her experience. She might have been an impressionable child – as all others of her age are – but her narration of <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuya </span>Ronnie’s placing his “<span style="font-style: italic;">titi</span>” in her “<span style="font-style: italic;">pepe</span>” was certainly one which could not be considered as a common child’s tale. Her responses during the examination of counsel and of the Court established her consciousness of the <span style="font-style: italic;">distinction </span>between <span style="font-style: italic;">good </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">bad</span>, which rendered inconceivable for her to describe a “bad” act of the accused unless it really happened to her. Needless to state, she described the act of the accused as bad. Her demeanor as a witness – manifested during trial by her unhesitant, spontaneous, and plain responses to questions – further enhanced her claim to credit and trustworthiness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>In a futile attempt at exculpation, accused-appellant claims that even before the alleged incident AAA was already suffering from pain in urinating. He surmises that she could have scratched herself which caused the abrasions. Dr. Preyra, however, was quick to rule out this possibility. She stated categorically that that part of the female organ is very sensitive and rubbing or scratching it is painful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The abrasions could not, therefore, have been self-inflicted.<br><br>That the Medical-Legal Officer found “no external signs of recent application of any form of trauma at the time of the examination” does not preclude accused-appellant’s conviction since the infliction of force is immaterial in statutory rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>More. That AAA suffered pain in her vagina but not in her anus despite her testimony that accused-appellant inserted his penis in both orifices does not diminish her credibility. It is possible that accused-appellant’s penis failed to penetrate her anus as deeply as it did her vagina, the former being more resistant to extreme forces than the latter.<br><br>Accused-appellant’s imputation of ill motive on the part of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> is puerile. No mother in her right mind would subject her child to the humiliation, disgrace and trauma attendant to a prosecution for rape if she were not motivated solely by the desire to incarcerate the person responsible for the child’s defilement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Courts are seldom, if at all, convinced that a mother would stoop so low as to subject her daughter to physical hardship and shame concomitant to a rape prosecution just to assuage her own hurt feelings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Alternatively, accused-appellant prays that he be held liable for acts of lasciviousness instead of rape, apparently on the basis of the following testimony of AAA, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>, that he merely “scrubbed” his penis against her vagina:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top"><div align="left">q-</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Is it not a fact that kuya Ronnie just made some scrubbed his penis into your vagina? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">a-</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">q- </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And when – he did not actually penetrated your vagina?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">a- </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote>Dr. Preya, however, found abrasions in the <span style="font-style: italic;">labia minora</span>, which is “directly beneath the <span style="font-style: italic;">labia majora</span>,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> proving that there was indeed penetration of the vagina, not just a mere rubbing or “scrubbing” of the penis against its surface.<br><br>In fine, the crime committed by accused-appellant is not merely acts of lasciviousness but statutory rape.<br><br>The two elements of statutory rape are (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman, and (2) that the woman is below twelve years of age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As shown in the previous discussion, the first element, carnal knowledge, had been established beyond reasonable doubt. The same is true with respect to the second element.<br><br>The victim’s age is relevant in rape cases since it may constitute an <span style="font-weight: bold;">element</span> of the offense. Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 335. <span style="font-style: italic;">When and how rape is committed.</span> – Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>x x x.<br><ol start="3"><li>When the woman is under <span style="font-weight: bold;">twelve years of age</span> x x x.</li></ol>x x x.<br><br>The crime of rape shall be punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<br><br>x x x.<br></blockquote>Furthermore, the victim’s age may constitute a <span style="font-weight: bold;">qualifying circumstance</span>, warranting the imposition of the death sentence. The same Article states:<br><blockquote>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol type="1"><li>when the victim is <span style="font-weight: bold;">under eighteen (18) years</span> of age <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity with the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">x x x.<br></div><ol start="4"><li>when the victim is x x x a child <span style="font-weight: bold;">below seven (7) years</span> old.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">x x x.<br></div></blockquote>Because of the seemingly conflicting decisions regarding the sufficiency of evidence of the victim’s age in rape cases, this Court, in the recently decided case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Pruna</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> established a set of guidelines in appreciating age as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is an original or certified true copy of the certificate of live birth of such party.</li><br><li>In the absence of a certificate of live birth, similar authentic documents such as baptismal certificate and school records which show the date of birth of the victim would suffice to prove age.</li><br><li>If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim’s mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:</li><br><ol type="a"><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;<br></li><br><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;<br></li><br><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.<br></li></ol><br><li>In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim’s mother or relatives concerning the victim’s age, the complainant’s testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused.<br></li><br><li>It is the prosecution that has the burden of proving the age of the offended party. The failure of the accused to object to the testimonial evidence regarding age shall not be taken against him.<br></li><br><li>The trial court should always make a categorical finding as to the age of the victim.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Applying the foregoing guidelines, this Court in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Pruna</span> case held that the therein accused-appellant could only be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>since:<br><blockquote>x x x no birth certificate or any similar authentic document, such as a baptismal certificate of LIZETTE, was presented to prove her age. x x x.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x.<br></div><br>However, the Medico-Legal Report relied upon by the trial court does not in any way prove the age of LIZETTE, for there is nothing therein which even mentions her age. Only testimonial evidence was presented to establish LIZETTE’s age. Her mother, Jacqueline, testified (that the victim was three years old at the time of the commission of the crime).<br><div style="text-align: center;"><center><br>x x x<br></center></div><br>Likewise, LIZETTE testified on 20 November 1996, or almost two years after the incident, that she was 5 years old. However, when the defense counsel asked her how old she was on 3 January 1995, or at the time of the rape, she replied that she was 5 years old. Upon further question as to the date she was born, she could not answer.<br><br>For PRUNA to be convicted of rape in its qualified form and meted the supreme penalty of death, it must be established with certainty that LIZETTE was below 7 years old at the time of the commission of the crime. It must be stressed that the severity of the death penalty, especially its irreversible and final nature once carried out, makes the decision-making process in capital offenses aptly subject to the most exacting rules of procedure and evidence.<br><br>In view of the uncertainty of LIZETTE’s exact age, corroborative evidence such as her birth certificate, baptismal certificate or any other authentic document should be introduced in evidence in order that the qualifying circumstance of “below seven (7) years old” is appreciated against the appellant. The lack of objection on the part of the defense as to her age did not excuse the prosecution from discharging its burden. That the defense invoked LIZETTE’s tender age for purposes of questioning her competency to testify is not necessarily an admission that she was below 7 years of age when PRUNA raped her on 3 January 1995. Such being the case, PRUNA cannot be convicted of qualified rape, and hence the death penalty cannot be imposed on him.<br><br>However, conformably with no. 3 (b) of the foregoing guidelines, the testimony of LIZETTE’s mother that she was 3 years old at the time of the commission of the crime is sufficient for purposes of holding PRUNA liable for statutory rape, or rape of a girl below 12 years of age. Under the second paragraph of Article 335, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, in relation to no. 3 of the first paragraph thereof, having carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age is punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>. Thus, the penalty to be imposed on PRUNA should be <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, and not death penalty. (Italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>Several cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> suggest that courts may take “judicial notice” of the appearance of the victim in determining her age. For example, the Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Tipay</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> qualified the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Javier</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which required the presentation of the birth certificate to prove the rape victim’s age, with the following pronouncement:<br><blockquote>This does not mean, however, that the presentation of the certificate of birth is at all times necessary to prove minority. The minority of a victim of tender age who may be below the age of ten is quite manifest and the court can take judicial notice thereof. The crucial years pertain to the ages of fifteen to seventeen where minority may seem to be dubitable due to one’s physical appearance. In this situation, the prosecution has the burden of proving with certainty the fact that the victim was under 18 years of age when the rape was committed in order to justify the imposition of the death penalty under the above-cited provision. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>On the other hand, a handful of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> holds that courts, without the requisite hearing prescribed by Section 3, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> cannot take judicial notice of the victim’s age.<br><br>Judicial notice signifies that there are certain “<span style="font-style: italic;">facta probanda</span>,” or propositions in a party’s case, as to which he will not be required to offer evidence; these will be taken for true by the tribunal without the need of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Judicial notice, however, is a phrase sometimes used in a loose way to cover some other judicial action. Certain rules of Evidence, usually known under other names, are frequently referred to in terms of judicial notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The process by which the trier of facts judges a person’s age from his or her appearance cannot be categorized as judicial notice. Judicial notice is based upon convenience and expediency for it would certainly be superfluous, inconvenient, and expensive both to parties and the court to require proof, in the ordinary way, of facts which are already known to courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> As <span style="font-style: italic;">Tundag </span>puts it, it “is the cognizance of certain facts which judges may properly take and act on <span style="font-weight: bold;">without proof</span> because they already know them.” Rule 129 of the Rules of Court, where the provisions governing judicial notice are found, is entitled “What Need Not Be Proved.” When the trier of facts observes the appearance of a person to ascertain his or her age, he is not taking judicial notice of such fact; rather, he is conducting an <span style="font-weight: bold;">examination of the evidence</span>, the evidence being the appearance of the person. Such a process militates against the very concept of judicial notice, the object of which is to do away with the presentation of evidence.<br><br>This is not to say that the process is not sanctioned by the Rules of Court; on the contrary, it does. A person’s appearance, where relevant, is admissible as object evidence, the same being addressed to the senses of the court. Section 1, Rule 130 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Object as evidence</span>. – Objects as evidence are those addressed to the senses of the court. When an object is relevant to the fact in issue, it may be exhibited to, examined or viewed by the court.<br></blockquote>“To be sure,” one author writes, “this practice of inspection by the court of objects, things or <span style="font-weight: bold;">persons</span> relevant to the fact in dispute, has its roots in ancient judicial procedure.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The author proceeds to quote from another authority:<br><blockquote>“Nothing is older or commoner in the administration of law in all countries than the submission to the senses of the tribunal itself, whether judge or jury, of objects which furnish evidence. The view of the land by the jury, in real actions, of a wound by the judge where mayhem was alleged, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and of the person of one alleged to be an infant, in order to fix his age</span>, the inspection and comparison of seals, the examination of writings, to determine whether they are (‘)blemished,(’) the implements with which a crime was committed or of a person alleged, in a bastardy proceeding, to be the child of another, are few illustrations of what may be found abundantly in our own legal records and textbooks for seven centuries past.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>A person’s <span style="font-style: italic;">appearance</span>, as evidence of <span style="font-style: italic;">age</span> (for example, of infancy, <span style="font-weight: bold;">or of being under the age of consent to intercourse</span>), is usually regarded as relevant; and, if so, the tribunal may properly observe the person brought before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Experience teaches that corporal appearances are approximately an index of the <span style="font-style: italic;">age</span> of their bearer, particularly for the marked extremes of old age and youth. In every case such evidence should be accepted and weighed for what it may be in each case worth. In particular, the <span style="font-style: italic;">outward physical</span> appearance of an alleged minor may be considered in judging his <span style="font-style: italic;">age</span>; a contrary rule would for such an inference be pedantically over-cautious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Consequently, the jury or the court trying an issue of fact may be allowed to judge the age of persons in court by observation of such persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The formal offer of the person as evidence is not necessary. The examination and cross-examination of a party before the jury are equivalent to exhibiting him before the jury and an offer of such person as an exhibit is properly refused. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This Court itself has sanctioned the determination of an alien’s age from his appearance. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Braca v. Collector of Customs</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>The customs authorities may also determine from the personal appearance of the immigrant what his age is. The person of a Chinese alien seeking admission into the Philippine Islands is evidence in an investigation by the board of special inquiry to determine his right to enter; and such body may take into consideration his appearance to determine or assist in determining his age and a finding that the applicant is not a minor based upon such appearance is not without evidence to support it.<br></blockquote>This Court has also implicitly recognized the same process in a criminal case. Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Agadas</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>Rosario Sabacahan testified that he was 17 years of age; that he had never purchased a cedula; and that he was going to purchase a cedula the following january. Thereupon the court asked this defendant these questions: “You are a pretty big boy for seventeen.” Answer: “I cannot tell exactly because I do not remember when I was born, but 17 years is my guess.” Court: “If you are going to take advantage of that excuse, you had better get some positive evidence to that effect.” Answer: “I do not remember, as I already stated on what date and in what year I was born.” The court, in determining the question of the age of the defendant, Rosario Sabacahan, said:<br><blockquote>“The defendant, Rosario Sabacahan, testified that he thought that he was about 17 years of age, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">judging by his appearance</span> he is a youth 18 or 19 years old. He has shown that he has no positive information on the subject and no effort was made by the defense to prove the fact that he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of article 9, paragraph 2, of the Penal code, which fact it is held to be incumbent upon the defense to establish by satisfactory evidence in order to enable the court to give an accused person the benefit of the mitigating circumstance.”<br></blockquote>In United States <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Estavillo and Perez (10 Off. Gaz., 1984) Estavillo testified, when the case was tried in the court below, that he then was only 16 years of age. There was no other testimony in the record with reference to his age. But the trial judge said: “The accused Estavillo, notwithstanding his testimony giving his age as 16 years, is, as a matter of fact, not less than 20.” This court, in passing upon the age of Estavillo, held:<br><blockquote>“We presume that the trial court reached this conclusion with reference to the age of Estavillo from the latter’s personal appearance. There is no proof in the record, as we have said, which even tends to establish the assertion that this appellant understated his age. * * * It is true that the trial court had an opportunity to note the personal appearance of Estavillo for the purpose of determining his age, and by so doing reached the conclusion that he was at least 20, just two years over 18. This appellant testified that he was only 16, and this testimony stands uncontradicted. Taking into consideration the marked difference in the penalties to be imposed upon that age, we must, therefore, conclude (resolving all doubts in favor of the appellants) that the appellants’ ages were 16 and 14 respectively.”<br></blockquote>While it is true that in the instant case Rosario testified that he was 17 years of age, yet the trial court reached the conclusion, judging from the personal appearance of Rosario, that “he is a youth 18 or 19 years old.” Applying the rule enunciated in the case just cited, we must conclude that there exists a reasonable doubt, at least, with reference to the question whether Rosario was, in fact 18 years of age at the time the robbery was committed. This doubt must be resolved in favor of the defendant, and he is, therefore, sentenced to six months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor</span> in lieu of six years ten months and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">presidio mayor</span>. x x x.<br></blockquote>There can be no question, therefore, as to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">admissibility</span> of a person’s appearance in determining his or her age. As to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">weight </span>to accord such appearance, especially in rape cases, <span style="font-style: italic;">Pruna </span>laid down guideline no. 3, which is again reproduced hereunder:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>If the certificate of live birth or authentic document is shown to have been lost or destroyed or otherwise unavailable, the testimony, if clear and credible, of the victim’s mother or a member of the family either by affinity or consanguinity who is qualified to testify on matters respecting pedigree such as the exact age or date of birth of the offended party pursuant to Section 40, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence shall be sufficient under the following circumstances:<br></li><br><ol type="A"><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 3 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 7 years old;<br></li><br><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 7 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 12 years old;<br></li><br><li>If the victim is alleged to be below 12 years of age and what is sought to be proved is that she is less than 18 years old.<br></li></ol></ol></blockquote>Under the above guideline, the testimony of a relative with respect to the age of the victim is sufficient to constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt in cases (a), (b) and (c) above. In such cases, the disparity between the allegation and the proof of age is so great that the court can easily determine from the appearance of the victim the veracity of the testimony. The appearance corroborates the relative’s testimony.<br><br>As the alleged age approaches the age sought to be proved, the person’s appearance, as object evidence of her age, loses probative value. Doubt as to her true age becomes greater and, following <span style="font-style: italic;">Agadas, supra</span>, such doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused.<br><blockquote>This is because in the era of modernism and rapid growth, the victim’s mere physical appearance is not enough to gauge her exact age. For the extreme penalty of death to be upheld, nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime must be substantiated. Verily, the minority of the victim should be not only alleged but likewise proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself. Be it remembered that the proof of the victim’s age in the present case spells the difference between life and death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>In the present case, the prosecution did not offer the victim’s certificate of live birth or similar authentic documents in evidence. The victim and her mother, however, testified that she was only three years old at the time of the rape. AAA’s testimony goes:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top"><div align="left">q- </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Your name is AAA is that correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">a-</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">q- </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And you are 3 years old?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">a-</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>That of her mother goes:<br><blockquote> <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top"><div align="left">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"> How old was your daughter when there things happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">3 and ½ years old.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> When was she born?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">In Manila, May 10, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Because of the vast disparity between the alleged age (three years old) and the age sought to be proved (below twelve years), the trial court would have had no difficulty ascertaining the victim’s age from her appearance. No reasonable doubt, therefore, exists that the second element of statutory rape, i.e., that the victim was below twelve years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, is present.<br><br>Whether the victim was below seven years old, however, is another matter. Here, reasonable doubt exists. A mature three and a half-year old can easily be mistaken for an underdeveloped seven-year old. The appearance of the victim, as object evidence, cannot be accorded much weight and, following <span style="font-style: italic;">Pruna</span>, the testimony of the mother is, by itself, insufficient.<br><br>As it has not been established with moral certainty that AAA was below seven years old at the time of the commission of the offense, accused-appellant cannot be sentenced to suffer the death penalty. Only the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>can be imposed upon him.<br><br>In line with settled jurisprudence, the civil indemnity awarded by the trial court is increased to <s>P</s>50,000.00. In addition, AAA is entitled to an award of moral damages in the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 96, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.
