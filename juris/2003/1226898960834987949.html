Samar declared previously in the name of Tomasa Cabsag under Tax Declaration No. 29824 and at present declared under Tax Declaration No. 45509 in the name of Rosario Opana; bounded on the North by the land of Nicolas Calumpiano; on the East bounded by the land of Benito Lacro; on the South bounded by the land of Sabino Lacro and on the West bounded by the land of Catalina Naing with a total area of 24,715 sq. m. and is assessed at P1,460.<br><br></li><li>An agricultural land situated at Brgy.

When the said surviving spouse executed a Deed of Donation in favor of the defendant Rosario Opana, he had the right to donate the properties and ownership passed to the latter. x x x<br></blockquote>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> having been denied by the appellate court by Resolution of December 5, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the present petition was filed posing the following question:<br><blockquote> IS IT WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIAL COURT TO RULE ON THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PARCELS OF LAND IN QUESTION IN TH[ESE] PROCEEDINGS?<br></blockquote>Petitioners insist that what they filed before the trial court was one for probate — the settlement of the estate of Tomasa Cabsag, the complaint's denomination as one for partition notwithstanding; that the declaration by the trial court that respondent is the "true, absolute and exclusive owner of the two (2) parcels of land described in the complaint and in the Original Certificate of Titles issued in the name of the Defendant," which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, was rendered without or in excess of jurisdiction, for as the case is one for probate, it necessitated the initial determination and identification of the heirs of Tomasa Cabsag which the trial court failed to do.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>First. Contrary to the assertion of petitioners, since the defendant-herein respondent alleged exclusive ownership, the action for partition, which assumes that the parties are co-owners, had, as correctly held by the trial court, it citing <i>Rodriguez v. Ravilan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><i> </i>become one for recovery of property.<br><br>Petitioners harp on Tax Declaration No. 29824 covering the property in Mayana, but the boundaries set forth therein do not jibe with those of the property in Mayana in the possession of and registered in the name of respondent.<br><blockquote> Atty. Cablao [defense counsel]:<br><br>But your Honor our claim is different, the property the one situated at Brgy. Mayana is a property that was inherited by Eugenio Nadonga from his father so it has nothing to do with the property of Tomasa Cabsag. The property situated at Brgy. Surok is a property he purchased when he was still single before marriage to Tomasa Cabsag.<br><br>Court:<br><br>That is your evidence already. That is why when you asked [the defendant] the question is the property being claimed by the plaintiff different property that is now in your owner's certificate of title.<br><br>Atty. Cablao:<br><br>Yes, your Honor.<br><br>Court:<br><br>The Court observes that it is misleading because according to her it is different.<br><br>Atty. Chua [the plaintiffs' counsel]:<br><br>No, your Honor please her testimony awhile ago says that the property donated to her by Eugenio Nadonga at Brgy. Mayana is at present covered by owner's certificate of title no. 8859.<br><br>Court:<br><br>Yes, it is correct, but she also stated that is not the property of Tomasa Cabsag. x&nbsp; x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>In <i>Gesmundo v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote> A person who claims ownership of real property is duty bound to <u>clearly identify the land being claimed in accordance with the document on which he anchors his right of ownership</u>. When the record does not show that the land subject matter of the action has been exactly determined, such action cannot prosper. <u>Proof of ownership together with identity of the land is the basic rule</u>. (Citations omitted, underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners failed to come up with a clear description of the land sought or claimed.&nbsp; On that score alone, their case fails.<br><br>Second. The late Eugenio Nadonga disposed of the questioned two parcels of land to respondent during his lifetime by a duly notarized "Deed of Donation" dated June 4, 1965, the pertinent portions of which are reproduced below, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote> x x x<br><br>That the DONOR is the owner in fee simple of that certain real property with coconuts planted thereon situated in Bo. Mayana and Surok, Guiuan, Samar, Philippines, with both parcels of land described hereunder, to wit:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">North&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - bounded by Teresa Naing;<br>South&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; bounded by Miguel Nadonga;<br>East&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; bounded by Hilario Parcela; and<br>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; bounded by Pascual Ecleo and Dominga Hamihan<br></div><br>And the land situated in Bo.

The rule is settled that a land registration case is an action in rem and is binding on the whole world, including petitioners.<br><br>Fourth.&nbsp; The deed of donation aside, respondent has not only proven actual continuous possession of the questioned properties for decades; she has presented tax receipts and declarations covering them. "Tax receipts and declarations are prima facie proofs of ownership or possession of the property for which such taxes have been paid.&nbsp; <u>Coupled with proof of actual possession of the property, they may become the basis of a claim for ownership</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>At all events, petitioners' filing of the action only in 1992 or after a lapse of several years despite, not only their knowledge of Eugenio Nadonga's and respondent's continuous possession of the properties, but also the registration thereof in respondent's name demonstrates laches which this Court cannot tolerate.<br><blockquote> Laches means the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time to do that which, by observance of due diligence, could or should have been done earlier.&nbsp; It is <u>negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert his right either has abandoned or declined to assert it</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>" (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit and the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is, in light of the foregoing reasons, hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Panganiban</i>, and <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Corona, J.</i>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Fifteenth Division, Associate Justice Salome A.
