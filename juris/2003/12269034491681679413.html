				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Incestuous rape is at all times despicable and ultimately reprehensible as its sordidness is beyond the understanding and imagination of any normal human being.&nbsp; As one of the most perverted forms of sexual aberration, it deserves this society's condemnation without any compassion.<br><br>For automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated October 23, 1998 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 55, Macabebe, Pampanga in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-1887-M and 97-1888-M finding Danilo Y. Alfaro, appellant herein, guilty of two counts of rape and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of death.<br><br>Appellant was charged with rape in two Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which, except for the dates of its commission, similarly read as follows:<br><blockquote> "That on or about the [15<sup>th</sup> day of January 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day of February 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>], in Barangay San Nicolas, Municipality of San Simon, Province of Pampanga, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, DANILO ALFARO Y YALUNG alias DAN/DANNY, with lewd design, taking advantage of superior strength and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with <b>her daughter, </b>Marilou M. Alfaro, <b>13 years old,</b> against her will and without her consent.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, appellant, assisted by counsel, pleaded "not guilty" to both charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thereafter, the two cases were jointly heard. The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: Marilou Alfaro, the victim; Maria Luisa Alfaro, the victim's mother; and Dr. Marie Antoinette Golding who examined the victim.&nbsp; Their testimonies established the following:<br><br>Marilou was born on September 14, 1983 to appellant and Maria Luisa as shown by her Certificate of Live Birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> They live in San Nicolas, San Simon, Pampanga. On January 15, 1996, at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, while Marilou was sleeping in their house she was suddenly roused from sleep by appellant when he removed her panty and placed himself on top of her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She felt terrible pain as he inserted his penis in her vagina.&nbsp; He continued molesting her sexually until he was able to satisfy his bestial lust.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>After that harrowing incident, Marilou noticed a white sticky substance in her private part.&nbsp; Then she wore her panty and slept.<br><br>Again, on February 14, 1996, at around 11:00 o'clock in the evening, while Marilou and her two brothers were sleeping in their house, she was awakened by appellant as he undressed her and placed himself on top of her, inserting his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She cried because it was painful. Thereafter, she found a white sticky substance in her private part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Marilou did not immediately tell the incidents to anybody because appellant threatened to kill her and her mother if she would do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Maria Luisa testified that in the evening of April 23, 1997, she caught appellant stooping over their sleeping daughter Marilou and kissing her genitalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Surprised by his wife's presence, he immediately went out with his penis protruding out of his shorts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He warned her to keep quiet or else he would kill her.&nbsp; This incident prompted Marilou to inform her mother that appellant sexually molested her on January 15 and February 14, 1996.<br><br>On April 25, 1997, Marilou accompanied by her mother, was examined by Dr. Marie Antoinette Golding, a resident physician of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital in Pampanga.&nbsp; On April 27, 1997, she issued a Medico-Legal O.B. -Gyne Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> stating that the victim's hymen has superficial healed lacerations at 3:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock positions which could have been caused by a man's erect organ<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and by the rape incidents on January 15, and February 14, 1996.&nbsp; She also found that Marilou's introitus could admit two fingers with ease.<br><br>On April 26, 1997, Maria Luisa and her daughter Marilou went to the Apalit Police Station and reported the incidents.&nbsp; Marilou executed a <i>"Sinumpaang Salaysay,"</i> marked as Exhibit "B,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> partly quoted as follows:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"T-09: <i></i></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"><i>Bakit mo gustong ireklamo ang iyong tatay na si Danilo Alfaro?</i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>S: <i></i></td> <td><div align="justify"><i>Dahil po pinagsamantalahan (ginahasa) niya po ako ng <b>puwersahan na may halong pananakot at&nbsp;

Because of this incident, she came to know that he raped Marilou twice in the past.<br><br>Both Marilou and Maria Luisa confirmed the contents of their respective <i>"Sinumpaang Salaysay"</i> during the trial.<br><br>The defense presented appellant as its sole witness.&nbsp; He vehemently denied the charges, contending that on January 15, 1996, he was at home; and that on February 14, 1996, he was in Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He claimed that in testifying against him, his wife and daughter were ill motivated because he abandoned them for nine years.&nbsp; Moreover, that it took them one year before reporting the incidents to the authorities engenders doubt on the veracity of the charges.<br><br>On October 23, 1998, the trial court rendered its Decision convicting appellant of two counts of incestuous rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, thus:<br><blockquote> "The acts committed by the accused against his daughter constitutes the abhorable (sic) crime of incestuous rape committed with the gravest abuse of parental authority.&nbsp; <b>The accused had the moral ascendancy and influence that substitutes for the violence or intimidation required in rape cases.&nbsp; His act of having sexual intercourse with his daughter who was then at the tender age of thirteen (13) years old may be considered to have the effect of statutory rape.&nbsp; The Court also believes that strong force of intimidation by implication existed during the sexual molestation committed by the accused Danilo Alfaro against his daughter Marilou M. Alfaro.&nbsp; </b>His defense of alibi that he was elsewhere at the time, and his explanation that he did not do it as he loves his family and blamed his parents-in-law as those who were responsible in bringing about the accusation against him because they were mad at him, is totally rejected as they are unbelievable.<br><br>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of rape and as a consequence of which and pursuant to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal code, he is hereby sentenced to the corresponding mandatory penalty of death and he is likewise ordered to indemnify the offended party the sum of P100,000.00."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal, appellant ascribing to the trial court the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> "I<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION DESPITE THE EXISTENCE OF ILL-MOTIVE ON THEIR PART AND THE INCREDIBLE LENGTH OF TIME IT TOOK THE COMPLAINANT TO REPORT THE CRIME.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF TWO (2) COUNTS OF RAPE."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>The Solicitor General counters that if indeed appellant's wife and daughter were ill motivated, then they should have charged him earlier considering that he abandoned them for nine years.&nbsp; Likewise, Marilou failed to report the incidents to the authorities immediately because he threatened to kill her and her mother.<br><br>After a careful review and evaluation of the entire record, we agree with the trial court that appellant is guilty as charged.<br><br>Marilou testified in a straightforward, candid and convincing manner, which leaves no room for doubt that she was in fact ravished twice by her own father.&nbsp; She positively identified him as her rapist.&nbsp; She testified as follows:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"FISCAL DATU<br>Questioning</td>

It bears emphasis that appellant resorted to force, threat and intimidation to consummate his lust.&nbsp; In her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Marilou stated: <i>"pinagsamantalahan (ginahasa) niya po ako <b>ng puwersahan na may</b></i> <b><i>halong pananakot at pagbabantang ako ay papatayin."</i></b>&nbsp; Marilou categorically affirmed such declaration when she testified in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Courts usually give credence to such testimony, particularly if it constitutes incestuous rape, because, normally, no person would be willing to undergo the humiliation of a public trial and to testify on the details of her ordeal were it not to condemn an injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It is a settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child-victims are given full weight and credit.&nbsp; When a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Young as she was then, Marilou withstood all the rigors of the case, such as the initial police interrogation, the medical examination, the formal charge, the public trial and the cross-examination. And she never wavered in her testimony even after it was explained to her that her father could be meted the death penalty if found guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> If it was true that she merely made up the charge, she should have been bothered by her conscience at the sight of her father in a prisoner's garb at the detention cell.&nbsp; It certainly would take a most senseless kind of depravity for a young daughter to concoct a story of rape which would consign her own father to the supreme penalty of death if the same were not the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Moreover Marilou's testimony is corroborated by the findings of Dr. Golding that the lacerations on her hymen were compatible with the incidents of rape on January 15 and February 14, 1996.&nbsp; According to Dr. Golding, the multiple healed hymenal lacerations at 3:00 o'clock and 9:00 o'clock positions could have been caused by an erect organ of a man<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and that her introitus could admit two fingers with ease.<br><br>As against Marilou's positive and categorical testimony, appellant could only proffer the defense of alibi.&nbsp; In a chain of cases, we ruled that for alibi to prosper, it must be proven that during the commission of the crime, the accused was in another place and that it was physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is not so in the present case. Appellant admitted in his testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that he was at home with his family in San Simon, Pampanga on January 15, 1996 when the crime took place.&nbsp; It must be recalled that the rape was committed in the evening of that day at San Nicolas of the same town.&nbsp; We can safely conclude, therefore, that it was physically possible for appellant to be at the scene of the crime during its commission.<br><br>Moreover, while appellant sought to establish that he went to Manila on February 14, 1996 when the second rape was committed, however, he could not categorically admit he really left for Manila.&nbsp;

Indeed, a rape victim's actions are oftentimes moved by fear rather than by reason.&nbsp; In incestuous rape, this fear is magnified because the victim usually lives under the same roof as the perpetrator or is at any rate subject to his dominance because of their blood relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, applicable to these cases, provides:<br><blockquote> "Art. 335.&nbsp;
