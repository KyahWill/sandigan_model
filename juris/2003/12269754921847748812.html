				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellants, spouses Rodrigo "Rudy" Opeliña and Mary Rose Leones Opeliña, having been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 19, Cagayan de Oro City in a December 16, 1999 decision, they lodged the present appeal.<br><br>The inculpatory portion of the Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated April 20, 1998 charging appellants for the rape of their househelper Merrylin Rambuyon (Merrylin) reads as follows:<br><blockquote> That on April 5, 1998, at about midnight, at Gemini Street, Phase I, Villa Ernesto Subdivision, Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, who are spouses, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, with force, violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Merrylin Labanes Rambuyon, a 15 year old minor, and househelper of both accused, against the latter's will by then and there inviting (by accused Mary Rose Leones Opeliña) the said minor to their (accused couple's) bedroom, while both accused were all naked, and while the said minor victim was already inside the bedroom accused Mary Rose Leones Opeliña locked the bedroom's door, and accused Rodrigo "Rudy" Opeliña undressed the said victim, pushed her to the bed, accused Mary Rose Leones Opeliña held the right arm of the victim tightly while the other accused held the minor's other arm, then accused Rodrigo "Rudy" Opeliña started kissing the victim's face, ears and down to her breasts, laid himself on top of her and inserted his penis on the victim's vagina, to which the victim cried and shouted for help as she felt pain everytime the penis of the accused penetrated her vagina walls, at this point accused Mary Rose Leones Opeliña told the victim to just bear the pain, his penis had full penetration on her vagina, which unlawful acts were done all against the victim's will, with threats to kill her should she report the same to anybody.<br><br>Contrary to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 8353.<br></blockquote>When arraigned on May 22, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> appellants, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charge, whereupon trial commenced.<br><br>The following facts are not disputed or refuted.<br><br>Private complainant Merrylin was hired as a househelper in Cagayan de Oro City by appellants on April 1, 1998. Four days later or on April 5, 1998, at about midnight, Merrilyn was awakened from her slumber in the living room located at the ground floor of appellants' 2-storey house by appellant Mary Rose Opeliña (Mary Rose).&nbsp; She was told to open the main door of the house upon the arrival of Mary Rose's husband, appellant Rodrigo Opeliña (Rodrigo). Soon after, Rodrigo arrived and proceeded to the bedroom at the ground floor of the house which he shared with his wife.&nbsp; After Merrylin lay down to sleep, she heard Mary Rose call for her and so she went inside appellants' bedroom.<br><br>Upon entering appellants' room, Rodrigo and Mary Rose undressed themselves until both were stark naked. Mary Rose immediately locked the door,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> while Rodrigo approached Merrylin, held her shoulders, removed her clothes, dragged her and pushed her to the bed.&nbsp; He then mounted Merrylin, kissed her lips, licked her neck and sucked her breasts.&nbsp; He proceeded to insert his penis into her vagina and made "pumping" motions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> All this time, Mary Rose was by Merrilyn's right side, holding her down by pinning her hand to the bed and telling her to "bear the pain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Mary Rose subsequently told her husband "that is enough, Rod, let's do it next".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Rodrigo thereupon proceeded to mount his wife and have sexual intercourse with her.<br><br>Thus spawned the charge of rape against appellants.<br><br>From the evidence for the prosecution consisting of the testimonies of Merrilyn, radio station reporter Willy Baylon, social worker Aida Ramber and Dr. Tammy L. Uy and some documents, the following details of the post-sexual intercourse with Merrilyn were established.<br><br>As Rodrigo started to have sexual intercourse with Mary Rose, Merrilyn started to put on her clothes and noticed that her vagina was bleeding.&nbsp; Sensing what Merrilyn was doing, Mary Rose told her to stay in the room "because your Kuya would fuck you again".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Merrylin, however, pleaded to be allowed to leave because she felt severe pain in her vagina, but the same fell on deaf ears, and she could not open the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> At dawn of the day following, at approximately 3 a.m., Merrilyn was finally able to get out of the room after Mary Rose unlocked the door.&nbsp; She then returned to the living room and tried, with much difficulty, to sleep.<br><br>At about 5 a.m., Mary Rose woke Merrylin up and the two repaired to a nearby river to do their laundry.&nbsp; While at the river, Mary Rose told Merrylin not to talk about what had occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> After they returned home, Merrylin hanged the laundered clothes and was soon advised by Rodrigo to take her breakfast.<br><br>Merrilyn refused to eat, however.&nbsp; She just proceeded to tend to appellants' one year old child.&nbsp; As the child soon fell asleep, Merrylin went outside the house, reflecting on what had happened to her.&nbsp; It was then that Arthur Leones, Mary Rose's father, called her and ordered her to get inside the house. She ignored him, however, prompting him to go outside, pull her hair and thrice slam her head on the wall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Merrylin thus went inside the house and told her friend Titing, a neighbor of appellants on whose solicitation she was hired as appellants' househelper, that she had been mauled by Arthur.&nbsp; Titing proceeded to seek help from police authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, Mary Rose took her child from the bed, she telling Merrilyn that she would report her to the police because she left her child unattended.&nbsp; At about 9:00 p.m., a policeman arrived and brought Merrylin, who was accompanied by Ely Agbu, another friend, to a police station - "office of Agora" - where Mary Rose was already reporting that Merrilyn had left her child unattended.&nbsp; Overcome by fear at Mary Rose's presence, Merrylin only reported her maltreatment by Arthur Leones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> After she was interviewed by the policeman, she was accompanied by the police to the Northern Mindanao Medical Center for determination of the presence of head injuries.&nbsp; None was found, however.<br><br>As Merrilyn and Ely were starting to walk on their way home, a taxicab stopped in front of them and asked them what happened.&nbsp; Ely replied that Merrilyn was raped by her employer, drawing the driver to bring them to a radio station, DXCC, where Merrylin was interviewed by reporter Willy Baylon.&nbsp; Merrylin was later brought to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in Macanhan, Carmen, Cagayan de Oro.<br><br>At the DSWD, Merrilyn recounted the rape incident to social worker Aida Ramber who instructed her to proceed to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for physical examination.&nbsp; On the same day, at the NBI Medico-legal Division, Northeastern Mindanao Regional Office, Dr. Tammy L. Uy, medico-legal officer, conducted a physical examination on her which yielded the following results:<br><blockquote> <u>GENITAL EXAMINATION:</u><br><br>Pubic hairs, fully grown, scanty. Labiae majora and minora, both coaptated.&nbsp; Fourchette, moderately tight.&nbsp; Vestibular mucosa, pinkish, with abrasion at its posterior aspect, and with fibrin.&nbsp; Hymen, tall, thick, fleshy, with healing, complete laceration at 6:00 o'clock position, with fibrin bleeds on slight manipulation, and with congested, edematous edges.&nbsp; Hymenal orifice, originally annular, admits a glass tube of 2.5 cms. With moderate resistance.&nbsp; Vaginal walls, tight; rugosities, prominent.<br><br><u>CONCLUSION:</u><br><br><u>Genital findings, compatible with sexual intercourse with man on or about the alleged date of commission of rape</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On April 8, 1998 or three days after the commission of the alleged rape, Merrylin executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> before Supervising Agent Patricio S. Bernales at the NBI.<br><br>Appellants denied the accusation. Rodrigo admitted, however, that on account of an agreement between Merrylin and his wife Mary Rose that he and Merrylin would have sexual intercourse so that the supposed unborn child in Merrylin's womb would be aborted, he was forced to have sexual intercourse with Merrilyn in Mary Rose's presence, and Merrilyn actually enjoyed their coitus because she responded by embracing him tightly.<br><br>Mary Rose, corroborating Rodrigo's version, declared that Merrylin had approached her and told her that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with Rodrigo in order to abort the fetus that she suspected was in her womb.&nbsp; She thus agreed to the proposition because she wanted to help her.<br><br>Finding for the prosecution, the trial court convicted appellants by the assailed decision of December 16, 1999, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, the court finds both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape committed by accused on the person of Merrylin Rambuyon, and so it hereby sentences them to reclusion perpetua, orders them solidarily, to indemnify her in the sum of P75,000, to pay her moral damages in the sum of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>The accused's custodian is hereby ordered to ship them to the proper higher authorities following promulgation without delay.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal, appellants assigning the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"> <li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT AND DISREGARDING THE THEORY OF THE DEFENSE.<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED SPOUSES GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF HAVING CONSPIRED TOGETHER TO RAPE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Appellants posit that Merrylin's claim that she was forced to have sexual intercourse is rendered suspect by the absence of extra-genital injuries on her body,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> as well as by the fact that the other occupants of the house did not hear any unusual noise or commotion at the time the rape was allegedly committed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> that Merrylin's conduct immediately after the incident belies that she was raped;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that Merrylin's complaint for rape was a mere afterthought, her primary purpose of going to the police authorities being only to report the mauling incident involving Mary Rose's father;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that Merrylin had a paramour with whom she had sexual intercourse, thus lending credence to their version that she suspected that she was pregnant and initiated the idea of sexual intercourse with Rodrigo to abort her child;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and that Merrylin's failure to make any outcry during the incident renders her charge dubious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>After a considered review of the records of the case, this Court finds that the trial court did not err in finding appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.<br><br>As the following account of Merrilyn, which was uttered with sobs, shows, there is no doubt that force attended the sexual intercourse:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td

Clearly, appellants conspired in the commission of the rape.<br><br>Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code provides that whenever rape is committed by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.
