				<BR><STRONG>AUSTRIA-MARTINEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">While this Court is not a trier of facts, there are instances however when we are called upon to re-examine the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals and weigh, after considering the records of the case, which of the conflicting findings is more in accord with law and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Such is the case at bar.<br><br>The antecedent facts of this case are as follows:<br><br>On June 12, 1980 at around 12:00 noon, Engr. Henry Tugade of the Pangasinan Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Panelco) rode in a company rover jeep together with four other employees bound from the Panelco compound in Bani to Bolinao, Pangasinan. Somewhere in Tiep, Pangasinan, a Dagupan bus that was also headed for Bolinao, began to follow the rover jeep. While the bus was trying to overtake the jeep, the latter turned turtle and caused four of its five occupants to fall out of the jeep causing the death of Tugade and another passenger by the name of Consuelo Estolonio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Separate cases for damages, docketed as Civil Cases Nos. A-1368 and A-1384 were filed by the heirs of the two deceased before the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan against Panelco and Dagupan Bus Co. and their respective drivers, Honorato Areola and Renato Quiambao. It is Civil Case No. A-1368 filed by the heirs of Henry Tugade, which is now the subject of the present petition.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan (Branch 55) held Panelco and its driver liable, thus:<br><blockquote>As a consequence and in view of the evidence on record, the Court holds and so finds that the accident occurred due to the fault or negligence of Panelco and its driver Honorato Areola. The negligence of Panelco consists in having allowed its rover jeep which is mechanically defective, unsafe and not roadworthy to be operated on a highway. On the other hand, the defendant-driver Honorato Areola was likewise, negligent in driving a vehicle which was not roadworthy, unsafe and with a mechanical defect.<br><br>The Court finds that the defendants Panelco and Honorato Areola are liable to pay to the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. A-1368 damages, as follows: actual damages, P99,131.00 (Exhibits "H" to "H-3", "I" to "I-4" and "K"), attorney's fees, P20,000.00, moral damages, P20,000.00 and exemplary damages, P10,000.00<br><br>As to loss of earning capacity, it has been held in Villa-Rey Transit vs. Court of Appeals, 31 SCRA 511, that this is based on net earnings and not gross earnings. No evidence was introduced to show the net earnings. However, under the Circumstances, the Court holds that a monthly net earning of P500.00 would be reasonable. Using the formula in the Villa-Rey case, the life expectancy of the late Henry Tugade would be 36 years, hence the Court awards P216,000.00 for loss of earning capacity.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby renders judgment:<br><ol type="1"><li> Dismissing the complaint and cross-claim as against Dagupan Bus in Civil Case No. A-1368;<br><br></li><li> Dismissing the complaint in Civil Case No. A-1384;<br><br></li><li> In Civil Case No. A-1368, ordering the defendants Pangasinan Electric Cooperative, Inc., and Honorato Areola to pay, jointly and severally, to the plaintiffs, the following:</li></ol><blockquote>P 99,131.00 as actual damages;<br>216,000.00 for loss of earning capacity;<br>20,000.00 moral damages; and<br>10,000.00 exemplary damages; and<br>20,000.00 attorney's fees</blockquote>With costs against said defendants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>In arriving at its decision, the trial court explained that:<br><blockquote>xxx Rosie Castrence, a passenger of Bus No. 244 who saw the accident testified categorically that the rover jeep turned turtle in front of the Dagupan Bus when the jeep was about 5 meters in front of the Bus and the jeep turned turtle even without being bumped by the Dagupan Bus. The Court considers this witness as an unbiased witness as she appears not to be an interested party. She was also in a good position to observe in detail what actually happened at the scene of the accident as she was seated on the right front seat of the bus. The Court believes this witness more than the other witnesses who do not appear to be disinterested.<br><br>Furthermore, it is not credible that if the rover jeep was hit on its left rear, it will turn turtle on its left side. The natural effect or tendency is for the jeep to be pushed or even thrown towards its right side. If the jeep turned turtle towards the left, it must have been due to some other cause than being hit by the bus on its left side.<br><br>The physical facts which do not lie as well as testimonial evidence support the stand of Dagupan Bus that the bus did not hit the left rear of the rover jeep.<br><br>If the bus did not hit the left rear of the jeep what then caused the latter to turn turtle. There is merit in the contention of defendant Dagupan Bus that the cause was due to some mechanical defect. By Defendant Areola's own admission, the rover jeep was being fixed by the Chief mechanic at the motor pool of Panelco, when he arrived at their compound, and that the jeep was "Quite old".<br><br>Likewise, Rosie Castrence also testified that when she first saw the Panelco jeep at Tiep, Bani, Pangasinan, the jeep was already zig-zagging and wiggling, a sign that indeed the jeep had some mechanical defect.<br><br>Another mark of a mechanical defect in the jeep was the fact that the right front wheel and rear wheel of the jeep were detached because their spindles were broken. This came from the mouth of Panelco's witness Florencio Celeste.<br><br>The next issue to be resolved is what was the cause of death of Henry Tugade? Plaintiff's theory is, of course, that Henry Tugade died because he was run over and pinned under the left front wheel of Dagupan Bus No. 244 crushing his head and upper body. This is the same theory of defendants Panelco and Areola. Defendants Dagupan Bus and Quiambao deny this claim and their theory is that Henry Tugade's death was caused by the violent impact of his head against the hard pavement of the road when he was thrown out of the rover jeep.<br><br>The plaintiff's theory is, however, contradicted by their own medico legal expert Dr. Wilfredo Nazareno who testified positively that the fatal injury which caused the death of Henry Tugade were the fractures on his head which could have been due to the impact of the head against the asphalted road.<br><br>Again plaintiff's theory is contradicted by Panelco's own witness Florencio Celeste, Chief Engineer, who was the only one who did not fall out of the jeep, when he testified that the left front wheel of the bus did not rest on the head of Henry Tugade and the wheel of the bus did not run over the head of the victim.<br><br>Rosie Castrence, a disinterested witness, also declared that the left front tire of the bus did not run over the head of Henry Tugade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners went to the Court of Appeals questioning only the award of damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> They claimed that the lower court erred in: finding that the monthly earnings of the late Henry Tugade at the time of his death was only P500.00; disregarding the evidence on record showing the monthly earnings of the late Henry Tugade; not considering the social, educational and economic status of the plaintiffs in its assessment of the moral and exemplary damages; and setting the sum of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Respondent Panelco also appealed to the Court of Appeals from the decision of the trial court and assailed its ruling that the negligence of Panelco and its driver was the proximate cause of the accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In its decision dated September 7, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court of Appeals reversed the findings of the trial court, declared that Dagupan Bus, as an employer, had exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees and disposed of the case in this wise:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the decision of the court a quo is reversed, but only insofar as it holds defendant Pangasinan Electric Cooperative, Inc. liable, and defendant Renato Quiambao is ordered to pay to defendant-appellant Pangasinan Electric Cooperative, Inc., P7,500.00 as temperate damages, P10,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>The appellate court explained, thus:<br><blockquote><b>The testimony of Castrence, on which the court a quo</b> heavily relied in its finding of facts, is contradicted by the greater weight of evidence on record.<br><br>First, there is no evidence whatsoever --- for either one of the parties --- of a blown-out tire. What the evidence on record indicates is that the two right wheels of the jeep were detached. The testimony regarding a blown-out tire is not even in consonance with the theory of Dagupan, that is, that the wheels were detached due to mechanical defects.<br><br>Second, her testimony that the jeep was wiggling and zigzagging is contradicted by the testimonies of Florencio Celeste <b>and Cipriano Nacar, passengers of the jeep and witnesses</b> for plaintiffs Tugade, to the effect that their ride was smooth and normal. (TSN, September 29, 1983, pp. 10, 43 &amp; 66; November 20, 1984, p. 7)<br><br>Third, her testimony regarding the sitting arrangement of passengers of the jeep is contradicted by the testimony of Cipriano Nacar, passenger of the jeep and witness for plaintiffs Tugade. According to Nacar, he and Estolonio were seated at the rear of the jeep; the driver Areola was behind the steering wheel, with Celeste to his right and Tugade on the rightmost. In other words, Celeste was between Areola and Tugade, and no one was seated to the left of the driver. (TSN, September 29, 1983, pp. 9-10)<br><br>Fourth, her testimony that Tugade's head was about one <b>foot from the left front tire of the bus is likewise contradicted by</b> the testimonies of Cipriano Nacar and Honorato Areola that the tire <b>of the bus was partly resting on the head of Tugade. In fact, the</b> bus driver Renato Quiambao even had to back up the bus so that Tugade's body may be pulled out from below. (ibid., pp. 22-23)<br><br>Fifth, her testimony that Tugade's shirt was checkered is also contradicted by Exhibit G, a photograph of the deceased as he lay on the ground. The photograph shows Tugade wearing a plain white shirt.<br><br>Finally, her testimony that she did not see Estolonio after the accident because the latter was inside the jeep is again contradicted by the finding of the court a quo that <u>"all the passengers of the rover jeep were thrown out of the vehicle except</u> <b>Florencio Celeste and the body of Henry Tugade landed on the left</b> lane of the road and was in front of the left front wheel of Bus No. 244." (underscoring ours, Decision, p. 2) In other words, Estolonio, just like Tugade, was sprawled on the ground. (ibid., p. 22)<br><br>Castrence's testimony is also marred by improbabilities.<br><br>First, she claims to have noticed the color of Tugade's pants who was seated --- in the front of the jeep. It is quite improbable that Castrence, being seated inside the bus, could see the color of the pants of Tugade who was seated on the front seat of the jeep. Second, while she noticed the passengers in the front of the jeep --- indeed she even noticed the color of the pants one of them was wearing --- she could not tell whether or not there were passengers at the back. Third, it is also improbable that the driver and the passengers of the jeep simply continued with their journey, <b>oblivious to the wiggling and zigzagging of their vehicle.</b><br><br><b>Moreover, even disregarding the incredibility of</b> Castrence's testimony, still the version that the accident was due to a mechanical defect that allowed the wheels to be detached cannot be given credence. If the cause of the accident was that both wheels on the right side were detached, then the jeep would not have turned turtle to its left, but to its right. If there had been no wheels to support its right side, the jeep should have turned turtle to its right, but it turned to its left instead.<br><br>The court a quo reasons that "it is not credible that if the rover jeep was hit on its left rear, it will turn turtle on its left side. The natural effect or tendency is for the jeep to be pushed or even thrown towards its right side." (Decision, p. 3) The court a quo, <b>however, seems to have disregarded the testimony of Honorato</b> Areola that the jeep first swerved to the right, then to the left. <b>(TSN, October 15, 1984, p. 48) To be noted also is</b> that a jeep is inherently maneuverable, and may easily swerve from side to side when hit from its left rear portion. Moreover, after the accident, both the jeep and the bus were at the left side of the highway. If the bus were not attempting to overtake the jeep, why then was it at the left side of the highway?<br><br>As may be seen from the foregoing, the court a quo failed to take into account the discrepancies and inconsistencies of Castrence's testimony vis-à-vis established facts and other evidence on record.<br><br>Moreover, the court a quo misappreciated the testimony of Areola that the jeep was being checked up at the Panelco motor pool, and interpreted such testimony to mean that the jeep was being fixed or repaired due to a mechanical defect. First, the mere fact that the jeep was at the motor pool does not mean that it was there due to a mechanical defect. As testified by Areola, it was being subjected to a check-up (TSN, October 9, 1984, pp. 41-42), which may have been simply routinary. Second, even assuming that the jeep had a mechanical defect, its presence at the motor pool may also mean that such defect had been repaired and that the jeep was "quite old" does not necessarily mean that it had a mechanical defect. That two wheels were detached from the jeep and that its spindle was broken can be just as reasonably explained by the fact that the jeep turned turtle after being sideswiped by an overtaking bus.<br><br>On the contrary, Celeste and Nacar, witnesses for the plaintiffs Tugade, consistently testified that their ride was normal and smooth.<br><br>In light of the foregoing, the conclusion must be that the accident was caused by the negligence of Quiambao in driving Bus No. 244, as testified to by Areola, Nacar and Celeste, for which he must be held civilly liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>xxx</blockquote>Hence, petitioner filed the present "petition for certiorari"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the decision of the Court of Appeals and the resolution dated June 27, 1995 denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals:<br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>...COMMITTED AN ERROR OF LAW AND VIOLATED THE RULES OF EVIDENCE BY REJECTING THE TESTIMONY OF A DISINTERESTED WITNESS AND ADMITTED THE BIASED TESTIMONIES OF THE EMPLOYEES-WITNESSES FOR PRIVATE RESPONDENT PANELCO.<br><br><center>II</center><br>...COMMITTED AN ERROR OF LAW BY SUBSTITUTING ITS FINDINGS OF FACTS TO THAT OF THE TRIAL COURT WHICH WAS IN A BETTER POSITION TO EVALUATE AT FIRST HAND THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE PARTIES, PARTICULARLY THE SITUATION, DEMEANOR AND SINCERITY OF THE WITNESSES.<br><br><center>III</center><br>...MISINTERPRETED, IF NOT DELIBERATELY DISREGARDED, THE BREAKING OF THE SPINDLE AND THE DETACHMENTS OF THE FRONT RIGHT AND REAR WHEELS OF THE ROVER JEEP OF PRIVATE RESPONDENT <b>PANELCO WHICH ARE CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF THE ROAD UNWORTHINESS OF THE ROVER JEEP THAT</b> TURNED TURTLE CAUSING THE DEATH OF THE LATE <b>HENRY TUGADE.</b><br><br><center>IV</center><br>...ERRED IN ARRIVING AT A CONCLUSION THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT WAS NOT NEGLIGENT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT AND IS NOT THEREFORE LIABLE FOR THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF HENRY TUGADE.<br><br><center>V</center><br>...ERRED IN NOT APPLYING PERTINENT JURISPRUDENCE AND PROVISIONS OF LAWS IN <b>REVERSING THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners stress that they only questioned before the Court of Appeals the amount of damages, loss of earning capacity and attorney's fees awarded by the trial court in its decision, but the appellate court disregarded the factual findings and conclusions of the trial court and substituted its own findings of fact. Petitioners claim that this violates the doctrine that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great weight on appeal as it is in a better position to decide the question on credibility having seen and heard the witnesses themselves. Petitioners further claim that: the Court of Appeals erroneously disregarded the testimony of Rosie Castrence which the trial court found to be a disinterested party, based on minor and trivial inconsistencies;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the appellate court overlooked or failed to consider the breaking of the spindles and the detachment of the front and rear wheels of the rover jeep owned by and belonging to respondent Panelco which led the trial court to conclude that the accident was due to the negligence of private respondent as it allowed its rover jeep which is mechanically defective and not roadworthy to be operated on a highway and due to the negligence of defendant Honorato Areola in driving a vehicle which was not roadworthy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In its Comment, respondent Panelco points out that the factual findings of the Court of Appeals is not reviewable by the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioners in their Reply, meanwhile, argue that where the findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contrary to each other, such as in this case, the Supreme Court may scrutinize the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In its Rejoinder, respondent Panelco reiterates that: the petitioners raised only factual issues which in effect will make this Court a trier of facts; the Court of Appeals, contrary to the contention of petitioners, actually set the record straight by carefully scrutinizing the factual evidence; the appellate court pointed out in detail the inconsistencies in the findings of the lower court unlike the haphazard way by which the lower court reached its conclusions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><i></i><br><br>We find the petition to be impressed with merit.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, it is settled that as a rule, our jurisdiction in cases brought to us from the Court of Appeals is limited to the review and revision of errors of law allegedly committed by the appellate court, as its findings of fact are deemed conclusive and we are not duty-bound to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence already considered in the proceedings below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>However, we have consistently enunciated that we may review the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>(a) where there is grave abuse of discretion; (b) when the finding is grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (c) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (d) when the judgment of the Court of Appeals was based on a misapprehension of facts; (e) when the factual findings are conflicting; (f) when the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (g) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; and, <b>(h)</b> <b>where the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court</b>, or are mere conclusions without citation of specific evidence, or where the facts set forth by the petitioner are not disputed by the respondent, or where the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> [Emphasis ours]</blockquote>In this case, the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals are conflicting. Thus, it behooves this Court to review the findings of facts of the lower courts.<br><br>The trial court gave weight to the testimony of Rosie Castrence, a passenger of Dagupan bus who testified that the Panelco rover jeep turned turtle <i>without</i> being hit by the bus from behind; while the Court of Appeals pointed out inconsistencies in her testimony and gave weight to the version of the employees of Panelco that the jeep turned turtle <i>because</i> it was hit by the bus from behind.<br><br>The trial court reasoned that Castrence, a fish vendor who happened to be a passenger at the time of the accident, was credible and unbiased being a disinterested witness, unlike the other witnesses who are employees of Panelco. It also explained that she was in a good position to observe in detail what actually happened at the scene of the accident as she was seated at the right front seat of the bus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Court of Appeals considered her testimony not worthy of belief because of inconsistencies especially vis-a-vis the testimonies of the employees of Panelco, namely: Areola, Nacar and Celeste,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> to which the appellate court gave greater weight and on which basis it concluded that the accident was caused by the negligence of Quiambao in driving Bus No. 244 for which he must be held civilly liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In ascertaining the facts of the case, it would have greatly aided the courts if photographs of the vehicles were presented during the trial. However, none was presented. Hence, we are constrained to rely mainly on the testimonies of the witnesses.<br><br>After reviewing the entire records of the case, we find compelling reasons to reverse the findings of the Court of Appeals, and affirm the appreciation of facts of the trial court.<br><br>It is basic that findings of facts of trial courts are accorded by appellate courts with great, if not conclusive effect. This is because of the unique advantage enjoyed by trial courts of observing at close range the demeanor, deportment and conduct of witnesses as they give their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Trial courts have the unique advantage of being able to observe that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witness' deportment on the stand while testifying --- the brazen face of the liar, the glibness of the schooled witness in reciting a lesson, the itching over-eagerness of the swift witness, as well as the honest face of the truthful one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Indeed, assignment of values to declarations on the witness stand is best done by the trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh firsthand the testimony of a witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>While there may be inaccuracies in Castrence's testimony as pointed out by the appellate court---the mention of a blown out tire, the seating arrangement of the passengers of the rover jeep, the color of the shirt of the deceased, and the location of all the passengers of the jeep after it turned turtle---we deem such discrepancies negligible considering the totality of her testimony. Records show that she was called to the witness stand six years after the accident happened. It is therefore understandable that she would miss recalling some details. As we held in the recent case of <i>People vs. Delim</i>:<br><blockquote>The inconsistencies in the testimonies of [witnesses] do not render them incredible or their testimonies barren of probative weight. It must be borne in mind that human memory is not as unerring as a photograph and a person's sense of observation is impaired by many factors... A truth-telling witness is not always expected to give an error-free testimony considering the lapse of time and the treachery of human memory. What is primordial is that the mass of testimony jibes on material points, the slight clashing of statements dilute neither the witnesses' credibility nor the veracity of his testimony...Inconsistencies on minor and trivial matters only serve to strengthen rather than weaken the credibility of witnesses for they erase the suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>In her testimony, Rosie Castrence said that she saw the jeep turn turtle in front of their bus.<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q</td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Mrs. Witness, you testified that the PANELCO jeep turned turtle infront of the Dagupan Bus, how close was the Dagupan Bus to the PANELCO jeep when you saw it turn turtle?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>About five (5) meters infront the Dagupan Bus when it turn (sic) turtle, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>In other words, the jeep turned turtle even without being bumped by the Dagupan Bus?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>She also testified that before the jeep turned turtle she saw that it was wiggling.<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">A</td><td width="90%">When we were still at Barangay Tiep I have seen already that jeep.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td>xxx xxx xxx</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>What did you observe if any about the jeep that you were following?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td><div align="justify">The jeep was already wiggling and was zigzagging along the way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>We find this testimony not only credible but also consistent with the physical evidence as well as the testimonies of Panelco's own employees.<br><br>Engr.
