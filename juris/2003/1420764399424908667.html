				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Certified to this Court for review by the Court of Appeals, pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court, is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Masbate, Branch 48, finding the appellants guilty of homicide. In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in CA-G.R. CR. No. 16723, the CA ruled that the appellants are guilty of murder as charged, and sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of<em> reclusion perpetua</em>.<p></p><p>On March 12, 1993, appellants Alfredo Gallego, Samuel Dellona, Leobert Gajeto and Erwin Villaros, together with Roberto Apinan, Tingting Gajeto, Ernesto Arollado, a certain John Doe alyas Jun, and another Richard Doe alyas Dimas, were charged with murder before the Regional Trial Court of Masbate, in an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which reads:<br></p><blockquote><p>That on December 2, 1992, in the evening thereof while on board the fishing boat F/B EVER IV and anchored at Panguiranan River, Balud, Masbate, Philippines, within the preliminary jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, taking advantage of nighttime, with intent to kill, evident premeditation, treachery and abuse of superior strength, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously conspiring and helping one another and armed with pieces of wood and knives, struck and stabbed one Alexander Adrias with pieces of wood and deadly weapons, hitting the latter and thereby inflicting fatal wounds that caused his instantaneous death.</p></blockquote><p>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>On their arraignment on April 28, 1993, the four appellants pleaded <em>not guilty</em> to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The other accused remained at large. Thereafter, trial ensued.</p></blockquote><p align="center"><em>The Evidence of the Prosecution</em> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>On December 2, 1992, at about 5:00 p.m., the fishing boat F/B Ever IV dropped anchor at the Panguiranan River, Panguiranan, Balud, Masbate. On board were Ernesto Arollado, the captain and radio operator; Roberto Apinan, the second captain; and the members of the crew, including herein appellants. Alexander Adrias boarded the vessel to buy fish from the crew members, but was told that the fish cold storage would be opened later at 9:00 p.m. Thereafter, Alexander invited all the nine crew members to his house at Barangay Salvacion, Balud, Masbate, just across the Panguiranan River, for a drinking spree. The crew members agreed. The group went ashore on board Alexander’s banca. Alexander had also earlier invited Elpidio Suarez to go back to the fishing boat with him later that night to buy fish. Elpidio agreed. At 8:00 p.m., Alexander and his visitors had consumed eight bottles of Tanduay Rhum ESQ. The group went back to the fishing boat on board Alexander’s banca. Elpidio followed them in his own banca. When Elpidio was by the outrigger on his way to the deck of the boat, he was shocked when he saw Alexander on the deck, about three arm’s length away, being stabbed by the accused and the appellants. The boat was lit by “trouble lights” located at its rear and center. Leobert stabbed the victim at the back; Samuel on the right jaw; Erwin on the body; Alfredo on the chest; and Roberto on the body below the right breast. Tingting and Ernesto each hit the victim with a piece of wood at the back of the head. Elpidio could not recall how many times the victim was stabbed. Shocked by what he saw, Elpidio forthwith paddled back to shore and rushed to the house of Tomas Codera, the victim’s stepfather to inform the latter of the gruesome incident.</p><p>At about 9:15 p.m., the F/B Sweetie Pie dropped anchor at Barangay Salvacion across the Panguiranan River. Tomas, the boat captain, saw the F/B Ever IV, at a distance of about fifteen meters from his boat, lift anchor on its way out of the river going towards the direction of Barangay Calumpang. He saw Alexander’s banca being untied from the F/B Ever IV. Tomas retrieved the banca and brought it to shore. When Tomas arrived home, he inquired from his wife where Alexander was. He was told that Alexander had gone to the F/B Ever IV on board his banca with the crew, and that the group had a drinking spree earlier in the afternoon. Shortly thereafter, Elpidio arrived and informed Tomas that Alexander had been stabbed on the deck of the F/B Ever IV. Elpidio, however, did not reveal the identity of the assailants. Tomas forthwith returned to the F/B Sweetie Pie and cruised along the river looking for the F/B Ever IV, but failed to locate it. The next day, at 7:00 a.m., Tomas informed Rosita of her husband’s death. Tomas, via cb radio, heard that the cadaver of Alexander had already been turned over to the police authorities at Barangay Calumpang, Balud. Tomas rushed to the police station in the said <em>barangay</em> and was able to recover Alexander’s body from the police authorities and brought it back to Barangay Salvacion.</p><p>Dr. Oscar B. Acuesta, Medical Officer V of the Balud Municipal Hospital, performed an autopsy on the body of the victim and submitted a report on his findings, thus:</p><p>PHYSICAL FINDINGS :&nbsp; </p><ol><li>Cadaver was embalmed&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </li><li>Stabbed [sic] [w]ound at the level of fourth intercostal space <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right chest penetrating the chest cavity hitting the Right Lung, wound two inches in length<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Stabbed Wound three inches in length at the level of fifth intercostal space Right chest penetrating the Right lung<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Stabbed Wound multiple (4 points) at the level of Right scapular area penetrating the chest cavity hitting the Right Lung.&nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li>Stabbed Wound about 4 inches in length at the upper arm&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>Stabbed Wound about 2 inches in length at the upper arm&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>Lacerated Wound .5 inch in length at the left temporal area</li></ol><p>CAUSE OF DEATH :</p><p>HEMORRHAGE, SEVERE SECONDARY TO MULTIPLE STABBED WOUND <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p>On December 7, 1992, another autopsy was conducted at the Veronica Memorial Chapel by Dr. Maximo L. Reyes, Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), who submitted a more detailed description of the injuries inflicted on the victim as incorporated in his Medico-Legal Report No. N-92-3370, to wit :</p><p align="center">POSTMORTEM FINDINGS</p><blockquote><p>Body, previously embalmed.</p><p>Hemothorax, 1,000 cc. right; 1,200 left, consisting of fluid and clotted blood.</p><p>Hemorrhage, meningeal: subdural and subarachnoidal, extensive.</p><p>Contused abrasions, 1.0 x 2.0 cm. right side of face; 1.0 x 2.0 cm. upper outer quadrant, left chest; 1.0 x 6.0 cm. posterior aspect, upper third, right forearm; 1.0 x 6.0 cm. left arm. <br></p><p>Hematoma, interstitial, scalp from both parietal area extending into the vertex. <br></p><p>Lacerated wound, 2.0 cm. left temporal area. <br></p><p><em>STAB WOUNDS :</em></p></blockquote><ol>&nbsp; <li>Elliptical, gaping, 3.5 cm. with clean cut edges and with one extremity sharp, other is contused, located over the right side of chest, 3.0 cm. from anterior median line, level of 3rd intercostal space, directed backward, laterally and downward, entering the chest, severing the upper lobe of right lung with an approximate depth of 10.5 cm.<br></li>&nbsp; <li>Elliptical, gaping, 4.0 cm. with clean cut edges and one extremity sharp, other is contused, located over the sternal area along midline, level of 2nd costal cartilage, directed backward, downward and to the left, entering the chest severing the descending aorta with an approximate depth of 11.0 cm.&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>Four (4) in number, all with clean cut edges and with one extremity sharp, other is contused, with sizes of biggest is 2.0 cm. and smallest of 1.0 cm. all located over the interscapular area of right side, covering an area of 7.0 x 10.0 cm. all directed forward, downward and medially, only the upper two entered the posterior chest wall, severing the middle and upper lobe of right lung, the lower two is non-penetrating.</li></ol><blockquote><p>All other internal organs are pale. <br></p><p>Stomach, ½ filled with undigested food materials.</p></blockquote><p>CAUSE OF DEATH: - STAB WOUNDS OF BODY; INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE, TRAUMATIC, CONTRIBUTORY. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>In the meantime, Alfredo surrendered to the police officers and admitted stabbing the victim. He claimed, however, that he did so in self-defense. He was forthwith detained. SPO1 Samuel S. Capasilan and PO3 Elmerando V. Santiago, Jr. prepared and signed a Police Report dated December 3, 1992 stating that Alfredo was the suspect in the killing of the victim. In the meantime, Samuel, Leobert, and Erwin were also detained in the municipal jail. On December 5, 1992, Elpidio arrived in the police station and was brought to the detention cell where he saw Leobert, Alfredo, Samuel and Erwin. He identified the four as Alexander’s assailants. He then gave a sworn statement to SPO3 Vicente Aragona of the Balud Police Station alleging<em> inter alia</em> that Alfredo, Samuel, Leobert and Erwin stabbed the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On December 6, 1992, a criminal complaint was filed with the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Balud, Masbate charging Alfredo, Samuel, Leobert and Erwin with murder for the killing of Alexander. Elpidio testified during the preliminary investigation.</p><p>On January 27, 1993, Elpidio Suarez executed a supplemental affidavit alleging <em>inter alia</em> that the other persons who ganged up on and helped in killing the victim were Ernesto Arollado, Roberto Apinan, Tingting Gajeto, a certain “Dimas” and one named “Jun” whose surname he did not know.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p align="center"><u><strong>The Evidence of the Appellants</strong></u> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p>Appellant Alfredo Gallego admitted stabbing and killing the victim but claimed that he acted in self-defense. The other appellants denied involvement in the killing. The appellants adduced evidence that the crew members and Alexander, had a drinking spree in the latter’s house. They consumed eight bottles of Tanduay ESQ and feasted on cooked fish. Shortly after their drinking spree, the group went back to F/B Ever IV. Exhausted and intoxicated, the appellants, except Alfredo, went to sleep. As soon as they arrived at the motor boat at about 8:00 p.m., Alexander ordered food from Alfredo, the cook of the boat. Alfredo only gave rice to Alexander, and told the latter that he was not able to cook any viand. Alexander was incensed and told the appellant that he was a useless cook and it would be better for him to resign from his employment. The appellant ignored Alexander’s diatribes and went to the kitchen to tidy things up. Meanwhile, Alexander went to the kitchen and took the knife from the tray near the door. With the knife in his hand, Alexander went near the appellant. The appellant moved backward towards the front part of the boat but Alexander pursued the appellant. When he was cornered, Alfredo was forced to grapple with Alexander for the possession of the knife. With his left hand, Alfredo held the victim’s right forearm, and with his left hand, twisted the victim’s right hand towards the chest. Alexander placed his left hand on Alfredo’s shoulder. Alfredo was able to wrest possession of the knife, and stabbed the victim on the chest. Alexander placed his right hand on Alfredo’s other shoulder, as he was stabbed on the chest, on the abdomen and on the back. Alexander fell, his head hitting the edge of the deck. Alfredo could no longer remember the number of times he stabbed the victim. He forthwith awakened the other appellants and informed them that he had just killed Alexander. They saw Alexander prostrate on the deck, and immediately started the engine, pulled anchor and left Panguiranan River. Alfredo suggested that they leave for Barangay Calumpang. At about 11:15 p.m., the boat arrived at Barangay Calumpang, Balud, Masbate, where Alfredo surrendered to police officers SPO1 Samuel S. Capasilan and PO3 Elmerando V. Santiago. Jr. of the PNP Detachment. He admitted to the police officers that he killed Alexander and surrendered the knife he used in stabbing the victim.</p><p>On December 4, 1992, appellants Dellona, Gajeto and Villaros, arrived at the police station to visit appellant Alfredo and give him clothes and some money. At 5:00 a.m., Elpidio and Rosita arrived at the station. Elpidio asked the names of the appellants. Later at 8:00 p.m., appellants Dellona, Gajeto and Villaros were told to stay in the police station and were detained. A criminal complaint for murder against them was filed on December 6, 1992 with the MCTC. Elpidio executed an affidavit and identified the appellants as the assailants of Alexander.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p>On May 6, 1994, the trial court rendered judgment finding the appellants guilty of homicide, the decretal portion of which reads:</p><p>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Alfredo Gallego, Samuel Dellona, Leobert Gajeto and Erwin Villaros GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide and hereby sentences each one of said accused to suffer imprisonment of TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>Prision Mayor</em> as Minimum to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>Reclusion Temporal</em> as Maximum and to pay the heirs of the victim, Alexander Adrias, the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos and to pay Eight Thousand (P8,000.00) Pesos for vigil and burial expenses without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.</p><p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the appellants contend that:</p><p align="center">I</p><p>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED SAMUEL DELLONA, LEOBERT GAJETO AND ERWIN VILLAROS GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF HOMICIDE.</p><p align="center">II</p><p>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER AND PLEA OF GUILT, AND THE EXEMPTING CIRCUMSTANCE OF SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST ACCUSED ALFREDO GALLEGO.</p><p align="center">III</p><p>THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO EXERCISE COLD NEUTRALITY IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF HOMICIDE AMOUNTING TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>In its Decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that all the appellants are criminally liable as principals by direct participation for the killing of Alexander and that the crime was qualified by abuse of superior strength; hence, the appellants are guilty of murder, and sentenced the appellants, except Alfredo to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p><p>Consequently, the Court of Appeals certified the case to this Court in view of the penalty imposed on some of the appellants.</p><p>While awaiting resolution of the instant appeal, appellant Samuel Dellona y Bebing filed on February 2, 1999, an “Urgent Motion to Withdraw Appeal” from the trial court’s May 6, 1994 judgment. The Court, in a Resolution dated June 9, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dismissed the appeal insofar as appellant Samuel B. Dellona was concerned. The Resolution became final on July 21, 1999. Hence, the present appeal involves only the remaining three other appellants: Alfredo Gallego, Leobert Gajeto and Erwin Villaros. The May 6, 1994 Decision of Branch 48 of the Regional Trial Court of Masbate, Masbate in Criminal Case No. 6955 has now become final and executory as to appellant Samuel Dellona.</p><p>The appellants did not file an additional Brief with this Court; hence, this case will be resolved by the Court on the basis of the Briefs of the parties in the Court of Appeals. </p><p>The issues posed in this case may be synthesized, thus: (a) whether appellant Alfredo acted in self-defense; and (b) whether the three appellants are guilty of murder.</p><p><em>Appellant Alfredo Gallego’s<br>&nbsp; plea of self-defense is barren<br>&nbsp; of merit.</em></p><p>Like alibi, self-defense in criminal prosecutions is a weak defense because it is easy to fabricate and difficult to disprove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Whether or not an accused acted in self-defense, complete or incomplete, is a factual issue to be determined by the trial court based on the evidence on record. Where the accused interposes self-defense as a justifying circumstance, he thereby admits having killed the victim; the burden of evidence shifts from the prosecution to the accused to prove with clear and convincing evidence the confluence of the following essential requisites: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Unlawful aggression is an essential and indispensable requisite, for without unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, there can be, in a jural sense, no complete or incomplete self-defense. The accused must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution because even if the evidence of the prosecution were weak, the same can no longer be disbelieved after the accused has admitted killing the victim; hence, the conviction of the accused must ensue as a matter of consequence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> An act of aggression when its author does not persist in his purpose, or when he discontinues his aggression such that the object of his attack is no longer in peril, is not unlawful aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Self-defense must be distinguished from retaliation; in that in retaliation, the inceptual unlawful aggression had already ceased when the accused attacked him. In self-defense, the unlawful aggression was still existing when the aggressor was injured or disabled by the person making the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p>In this case, the trial court and the Court of Appeals debunked appellant Alfredo’s defense and gave credence with full probative weight to the testimony of Elpidio Suarez. We agree with the trial court and the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the evidence on record belies his plea of self-defense.</p><p><em>First.</em> The victim sustained no less than six (6) stab wounds; two of the stab wounds were elliptical, on the right side of the chest, severing the upper lobe of the right lung and the descending aorta, while the other four (4) stab wounds were located at the right side of the interscapular area. The number, locations and depth of the wounds sustained by the victim belie appellant Alfredo’s pretension that he killed the victim in self-defense; the same are proof that Alfredo intended to kill the victim and not merely to defend himself.</p><p>Dr. Maximo Reyes testified that the multiplicity and nature of the injuries inflicted on the victim clearly indicate that there was more than one attacker. He also confirmed that stab wounds nos. 1 and 2 in his autopsy report, even if attended medically, were bound to cause the victim’s instantaneous death due to severe blood loss since the said wounds cut the blood vessels going to the heart and lungs, and severed circulation from the aorta to the heart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> This was corroborated by Dr. Acuesta who, in addition, testified that the wounds on the arms of the victim showed that it was the victim who tried to defend himself from his assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It certainly defies reason why Alfredo had to inflict such injuries on the victim if he was only defending himself. The findings of the trial court belie appellant Alfredo’s claim that he also stabbed the victim with his knife:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Moreover, the Court has carefully examined and measured the fatal knife. It was six (6) inches long with the blade of the knife about two and a half (2½) inches long and the handle is three and one half (3½) inches long. The blade of the knife was one (1) centimeter wide at its widest part. It was sharp on one side of the blade but not the back part. Yet, some of the stab wounds were six (6) or ten (10) inches deep.</p></blockquote><p>We have held that physical evidence is evidence of the highest order. It speaks more eloquently than a hundred witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p><em>Second</em>. Appellant Alfredo managed to wrest possession of the knife from the victim. While the appellant was grappling for the possession of the knife, the victim placed his left hand on the appellant’s right shoulder. Even after appellant had wrested possession of the knife, he stabbed the victim while the latter placed his right hand on the appellant’s other shoulder. The inceptual aggression of the victim had already ceased after the appellant had wrested possession of the knife. Nevertheless, the appellant stabbed the hapless victim six more times. Two of the stab wounds were at the back of the victim. The testimony of appellant Alfredo reads:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">COURT</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">to the witness)</td></tr><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>When you feel that you were cornered on the front deck, how did you hold the victim first?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>On his forearm.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>Please demonstrate?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>(Witness showing his right forearm between the hand and the elbow)</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>That was the first act that you did while the victim was approaching you you held him on the forearm?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>Yes, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>What was the immediate reaction of the victim when you held his forearm?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>When I held his forearm I felt that he is stronger than me, I immediately caught his hand and twisted it towards his body.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>That hand you twisted was the right hand of the victim holding the knife?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>Yes, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>And you twisted that hand holding the knife with your left hand because you said your right hand was holding the forearm?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>No, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>Which is correct?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>My left hand was the hand I used in holding his forearm and my right hand twisted his hand holding the knife.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q </td><td>So it is very clear now that your first act was to hold the forearm of the victim with your left arm?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>Yes, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(ATTY.

appellant’s shoulder instead of using it to pull away the hands of the appellant holding his right hand. Even after the appellant had wrested possession of the knife and had stabbed the victim once on the chest, the latter merely placed his right hand on the other shoulder of the appellant, thus allowing the appellant to stab him six more times without let up on the chest and at the back. The human instinct for survival and self-preservation would impel one who is about to be stabbed with a lethal weapon to try his utmost to wrest possession of the weapon from the attacker. However, the appellant would have us believe that the victim merely placed his hand on the appellant’s shoulder, thus enabling him to stab the victim several times. The appellant’s testimony is altogether unconvincing, contrary to human nature and the natural course of things.</p><p><em>Third.</em> Appellant Dellona admitted on cross-examination that Alfredo’s claim of self-defense was an afterthought in a last ditch attempt to cover up for the other appellants, hoping that the trial court would find merit in Alfredo’s plea.

They contend that: (a) Elpidio was a professional witness; (b) his testimony before the trial court that the victim was stabbed by eight members of the crew of the F/B Ever IV and was assaulted by another member of the crew armed with a piece of wood, is inconsistent with the affidavit he executed during the preliminary investigation that he saw only the four appellants stab the victim. This is also inconsistent with his supplemental affidavit to the NBI, that he saw the four appellants and the five other accused or nine members of the crew assaulting the victim; (c) he never informed Rosita, the victim’s widow, and the <em>barangay</em> officials in Barangay Panguiranan and Barangay Calumpang, Balud, Masbate, or the police authorities for that matter, that he witnessed the crime; and (d) his testimony is incredible as it is belied by the physical evidence on record as to the number of stab wounds the victim sustained. They also assert that Rosita herself testified that only Alfredo stabbed Alexander. The other appellants were implicated only because they happened to be at the police station to deliver Alfredo’s clothes and some money. When Elpidio arrived, he pointed to them as the victim’s assailants. Consequently, they were detained without any warrants of arrest. The fact that the appellants returned to the police station barely three days from the killing is evidence that their conscience was clear and that they were innocent of the crime charged. The prosecution failed to prove beyond cavil that the appellants conspired with Alfredo in killing the victim.</p><p>The assertions of the appellants do not persuade. At the outset, we note that the trial court and the Court of Appeals gave credence and full probative weight to the testimony of Elpidio, the lone eyewitness. The trial court found his testimony clear and positive. The Court of Appeals concurred with the observations of the trial court and even declared that the credibility of Elpidio was even bolstered on cross-examination, during which Elpidio graphically and vividly described with specificity the manner in which each of the appellants stabbed the victim: <br></p><blockquote><p>Indeed, we do not doubt the truthfulness of Elpidio Suarez’s testimony. No proof of ulterior motive for him to implicate all the accused has been offered. Where there is no evidence, and nothing to indicate that a witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.&nbsp; </p><p>He in fact stood his ground and stuck to his story under intense cross examination. Worse, the cross examination instead bolstered his story as the cross examiner made the mistake of asking him to describe in detail the manner in which each of the accused inflicted the wounds on the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p></blockquote><p>We agree with the Court of Appeals.

(pp. 7-B, TSN, July 26, 1993).&nbsp; </p><p>Accordingly, from the above findings of the NBI, it is evident that nine (9) persons collaborated in killing the victim, some of whom stabbed him while the others used their fist or blunt instruments thereby inflicting those physical injuries mentioned above.&nbsp; </p><p>In short, the fact that the victim suffered six (6) stab wounds plus several physical injuries all over his body is consistent with the testimony of Suarez that the nine (9) crew members of F/B Ever IV collaborated in killing the victim. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Although Dr. Maximo Reyes of the NBI Medico-Legal Office mentioned only six (6) wounds sustained by the victim, Dr. Oscar Acuesta testified that the victim sustained eight stab wounds, thus:</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td width="5%">Q </td><td width="95%">Will you tell us your findings one by one doctor?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>(1) The cadaver was embalmed</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(2) There was stabbed [sic] wound at the level of fourth intercostal space</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Right chest penetrating the chest cavity hitting the right lung, wound was two (2) inches in length</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(3) Stabbed wound three (3) inches in length at the level of fifth intercostal space right chest penetrating the right lung</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(4) Stabbed wound multiple (4) points at the level of right scapular area penetrating the chest cavity hitting the right lung</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(5) Stabbed wound about four (4) inches in length at the upper arm</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(6) Stabbed wound about two (2) inches in length at the upper arm.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(7) Lacerated wound .5 inch in length at the left temporal area.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Q</td><td> So how many stabbed [sic] wounds are there?</td></tr><tr><td>A </td><td>There are only eight (8) and [the] last one lacerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Dr. Reyes did not consider the wounds sustained by the victim on the upper arm and temporal area, claiming that the wounds could have been caused by a blunt instrument.

Elpidio expected Tomas to inform the victim’s widow:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">Q </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Right after informing Tomas Codera, you immediately left the place?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">You never reported said incident to any police authority?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td> <div align="justify">I did not anymore because I reported to Tomas Codera.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">And even in Panguiranan which you said you crossed right after informing Tomas Codera, you did not inform the <em>barangay</em> captain there, you did not inform the Sangguniang Bayan Member Lino Aninang and you never informed any other person or authorities for that matter because you have already informed Tomas Codera, am I correct?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">Mr. Witness, did you report this incident to the police authorities the following day, on December 3, 1992 or was it only on December 5, 1992 that you reported to the police of said incident?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">It was on December 5 that I reported the incident to the police authorities.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">So it took you almost three (3) days before you reported the said incident to the police authorities?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A </td><td><div align="justify">Yes, together with the filing of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In <em>People vs. Galido</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we ruled that fear of reprisal and the natural reluctance of witnesses to get involved in criminal cases are sufficient explanations for a witness’ delay in reporting a crime to the authorities. Besides, Elpidio, in the company of Rosita and Tomas, went to the police authorities and identified the appellants on December 5, 1992, or barely three days after the commission of the crime.</p><p>The well-entrenched rule is that different people react differently when confronted with a startling and frightening occurrence. There is no standard form of human behavioral response to crimes and other strange occurrences. Experience dictates that precisely because of the startling acts of violence committed right before their eyes, eyewitnesses can recall with a high degree of reliability the identities of the criminals and how at any given time the crime has been committed by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p>Admittedly, Rosita, the victim’s wife, testified on cross-examination that in her affidavit on December 7, 1992, she stated that her husband was killed by appellant Alfredo. However, as gleaned from the said affidavit, she had no personal knowledge of who killed her husband. She was merely informed by Tomas Codera that her husband was killed by appellant Alfredo. Significantly, she also stated in the said affidavit that she would elaborate further when the case is called for trial.</p><p>Even if it were true that the appellants went to the police station ostensibly to give clothes and money to Alfredo who had earlier surrendered to the police authorities, this does not in any way bolster their claims of innocence. Their presence at the station is not sufficient to overcome the prosecution’s overwhelming evidence against them. It bears stressing that the appellants were not aware that Elpidio had witnessed the crime; hence, they did not expect that someone would point to them as the culprits. The appellants’ plaint on their arrest and detention does not hold water since they failed to raise the same before their arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p align="center"><em>The Crime Committed by the Appellants</em></p><p>The trial court convicted the appellants with homicide with the attendance of abuse of superior strength in the commission of the crime. The Court of Appeals concurred with the trial court that indeed, the appellants abused their superior strength, but ruled that the appellants are guilty of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. We agree with the Court of Appeals. Nine assailants, including the appellants, ganged up on the victim and inflicted no less than six mortal wounds on the unarmed victim. The appellants took advantage of superiority in number and superior power to overwhelm and kill the hapless victim.</p><p align="center"><em>Proper Penalty on the Appellants</em></p><p>The crime was committed before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 7659 on January 1, 1994. The penalty for the crime under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code was <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its maximum period to death. In the absence of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the commission of the crime, the imposable penalty on the appellants is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, medium period of the penalty, pursuant to Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code.</p><p align="center"><em>Civil Liabilities of the Appellants</em></p><p>The trial court condemned the appellants to pay to the heirs of the victim Alexander Adrias the amount of P50,000 and P8,000 for vigil and burial expenses but did not award any moral and temperate damages. The decision of the trial court shall thus accordingly be modified. Conformably to current jurisprudence, the heirs are entitled to civil indemnity <em>ex delicto</em> in the amount of P50,000 and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p>Rosita Adrias testified that she spent the total amount of P81,000 for the vigil and burial expenses and for the cemetery lot where the victim was interred.
