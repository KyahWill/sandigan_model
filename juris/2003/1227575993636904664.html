				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At bar is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking the reversal of the Resolutions dated January 31, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and December 18, 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals outrightly dismissing the petition for certiorari filed by Antonio M. Serrano, herein petitioner, for his failure to attach therewith copies of all relevant pleadings and documents necessary in resolving the merits of the petition.<br><br>The controversy stemmed from the complaint for illegal dismissal filed with the Office of the Labor Arbiter by petitioner against Galant Maritime Services, Inc. and Marlow Navigation Co., Ltd., respondents. The complaint <i>was</i> docketed as NLRC NCR OCW (M)-98-07-0818.<br><br>After the submission of the parties' respective position papers and other responsive pleadings, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 15, 1999 in favor of petitioner. The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring that the dismissal of the complainant by the respondents in the above-entitled case was illegal and the respondents are hereby ordered to pay the complainant, jointly and severally, in Philippine Currency, based on the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of payment, the amount of EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY U.S. DOLLARS (US $8,770.00), representing the complainant's salary for three (3) months of the unexpired portion of the aforesaid contract of employment.<br><br>"The respondents are likewise ordered to pay the complainant, jointly and severally, in Philippine Currency, based on the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of payment, the amount of FORTY FIVE U.S. DOLLARS (US $ 45.00), representing the complainant's claim for a salary differential. In addition, the respondents are hereby offered to pay the complainant, jointly and severally, in Philippine Currency, at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment, the complainant's claim for attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total amount awarded to the aforesaid employee under this Decision.<br><br>"The claims of the complainant for moral and exemplary damages are hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<br><br>"All other claims are hereby DISMISSED.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>Both parties appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<br><br>On June 15, 2000, the NLRC promulgated a decision affirming in part the Arbiter's decision, thus:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Decision dated 15 July 1999 is MODIFIED. Respondents are hereby ordered to pay complainant, jointly and severally, in Philippine currency, at the prevailing rate of exchange at the time of payment the following:<br><br><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">1.</td><td width="40%">Three (3) months salary</td><td width="50%"> <br></td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td>$1,400 x 3</td><td>US $4,200.00</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Salary differential </td><td>45.00</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td><u>US $4,245.00</u></td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>10% Attorney's fees </td><td>424.50</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>TOTAL US $4,669.50</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td>Vvvvvvvvvvvv</td></tr></tbody></table><br>"The other findings are affirmed.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>Unsatisfied, petitioner filed a motion for partial reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> but the NLRC, in a resolution dated July 31, 2000, denied the same.<br><br>As a consequence, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari alleging that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in limiting the award of backwages to three (3) months and deleting the award for overtime and vacation leave pay, in violation of his constitutional right to due process, equal protection and non-impairment of contract.<br><br>However, in a Resolution dated January 31, 2001, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition outright for petitioner's failure to attach therewith copies of all relevant and pertinent pleadings and documents necessary in the judicious resolution of its merits.<br><br>On February 28, 2001, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> but was denied.<br><br>Hence, this petition for review on certiorari alleging that the Appellate Court erred in dismissing the petition for certiorari on pure technicality.<br><br>In his comment, respondent averred that the Court of Appeals should not be faulted for dismissing the petition as it did not comply with the Rules.<br><br>It bears stressing at the outset that "(c)ertiorari, being an extraordinary remedy, the party who seeks to avail of the same must strictly observe the rules laid down by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In this regard, Section 1, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, provides:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. Petition for certiorari.-<br><br>"xxx  xxx  xxx<br><br>The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof, copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto, and a sworn certification of non-forum shopping as provided in the third paragraph of Section 3, Rule 46.<br><br>"xxx  xxx  xxx."<br><br>Collorarily, Section 3, Rule 46, provides:<br><br>"SECTION 3. Contents and filing of petition; effect of non-compliance with requirements. -<br><br>"xxx  xxx  xxx<br><br>"The failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition."</blockquote>Needless to state, the acceptance of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> as well as the grant of due course thereto is, in general, addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>Although the court has absolute discretion to reject and dismiss a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, in general, it does so only (1) when the petition fails to demonstrate grave abuse of discretion by any court, agency, or branch of the government;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> or (2) when there are procedural errors, like violations of the Rules of Court of Supreme Court Circulars. One of these procedural errors is petitioner's "failure to accompany the petition with copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto," the same procedural lapse committed by herein petitioner.<br><br>In any event, petitioner attached to his motion for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' Resolution (dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i>) the required copies of the pertinent and relevant pleadings and documents. But despite such submission, still the Court of Appeals denied his motion.<br><br>We hold that petitioner substantially complied with the requirements set forth in Section 1, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Verily, in dismissing the petition outright, the Court of Appeals strongly placed a premium on technicalities at the expense of a just resolution of the case.<br><br>In <i>Cusi-Hernandez vs. Diaz,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><i> </i>this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Artemio V. Panganiban, held that "cases should be determined on the merits, after full opportunity to all parties for ventilation of their causes and defenses, rather than on technicality or some procedural imperfections. In that way, the ends of justice would be served better."<br><br>Indeed, "procedural rules are created not to hinder or delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice. It is far better to dispose of the case on the merits which is primordial end rather than on a technicality, if it be the case, that may result in injustice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In <i>Paras vs. Baldado</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <i>Alberto vs. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this Court held that "(w)hat should guide judicial action is the principle that a party-litigant is to be given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his complaint or defense rather than for him to lose life, liberty, honor or property on technicalities. x x x (T)he rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed."<br><br>Thus, we see no need to resolve the issues raised by petitioner. They should be addressed to the Court of Appeals.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the assailed Resolutions dated January 31, 2001 and December 18, 2001 of the Court of Appeals are hereby <b>REVERSED.</b> Let the case be <b>REMANDED</b> to that court further proceedings with dispatch.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Puno, (Chairman), Panganiban, Corona,</i> and <i>Carpio-Morales, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> at 182; 371.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 186; 374.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 93-110.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 139-148; 320-329.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Id</i>. at 183-195; 372-374.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Manila Midtown Hotels Land Corp. vs. NLRC,</i> G.R.
