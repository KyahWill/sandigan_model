				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the January 6, 1999 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 34, Calamba, Laguna finding appellant Oscar Calamlam guilty of two counts of rape.<br><br>In two informations dated August 27, 1997, appellant was charged before the Calamba RTC with two counts of rape of his daughter AAA, docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 5487-97-C and 5488-97-C. The inculpatory portions of the informations read as follows:<br><blockquote><center><u>Criminal Case No. 5488-97-C</u><br></center><br>That sometime in September 1989, at at (sic) Brgy. Maahas, Municipality of Los Baños Province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, through force, violence and intimidation and with lewd design did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal relation with his daughter, one AAA fourteen (14) years old, a minor, against her will and consent to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><u><center>Criminal Case No. 5487-97-C<br></center></u><br>That on or about July 22, 1997, at Brgy. Maahas, Municipality of Los Baños Province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, through force, violence and intimidation and with lewd design did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal relation with his daughter, one AAA twenty-two (22) years old, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned on March 2, 1998, appellant, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded "not guilty" in both cases which were consolidated and jointly tried.<br><br>The prosecution established the following:<br><br>At about noon in September 1989, in barangay Maahas, Los Baños, Laguna, AAA, then aged 14, arrived home from school and found her father-herein appellant alone.&nbsp; After partaking lunch, she went to their bedroom where appellant pushed her to the bed.&nbsp; Taken aback, she asked him why, but he told her to stop talking and proceeded to punch her stomach and her "side".<br><br>Appellant then removed AAA's panty as he did his own underwear, drawing her to cry profusely and to plead with and tell him <i>"Sabi po ninyo hindi ninyo gagawin ang ginawa ninyo kay ate."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; Unmindful of her plea, appellant proceeded to part her legs and forcibly insert his penis into her vagina.<br><br>After satisfying his lust on AAA, appellant ordered her not to tell her mother, threatening to kill her and her siblings should she do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After the lapse of several days, AAA was and had since been repeatedly sexually abused by appellant until she reached the age of 18.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On July 22, 1997, while AAA's mother and brothers were watching television in the living room and her sister was studying in the dining room, appellant told her, as she was about to sleep, that he wanted to have sex with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She vehemently refused, but he once again punched and slapped her, causing her face to slam against the door.&nbsp; As she could no longer offer any resistance and she could not shout for help, appellant having warned her that is she did he would hurt her, appellant was able to "again do it to [her]".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The following day or on July 23, 1997, AAA went to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Criminal Investigation Group in Canlubang, Laguna with her friend Lychin Rivel to report the sexual assaults against her.<br><br>Senior Inspector Joselito Antonio Rodrigo, Medico-Legal Officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, physically examined AAA, the results of which are reflected in his Medico-Legal Report M-059-97.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Dr. Rodrigo found that she was no longer a virgin; her hymen had a deeply healed laceration at 6:00 o'clock position; and her external vaginal orifice offered moderate resistance to the introduction of the examining index finger.<br><br>Thus spawned the filing of the cases at bar.<br><br>Appellant denied having sexually assaulted AAA.&nbsp; He asserted that the charges against him were made on account of an altercation he had with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He speculated that because he is very strict with her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and beats her up frequently,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> she concocted the charges.<br><br>Testifying in appellant's defense, his wife <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gloria</span> and their son <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Oscar, Jr.</span> claimed that AAA never told them about the alleged sexual assaults prior to the filing of the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>AAA's sister <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nonafe</span> who likewise testified in appellant's defense speculated that her sister filed the charges against their father in her (AAA's) desire to have him incarcerated on account of the beatings he repeatedly inflicted on her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> And she claimed that AAA forced her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to execute a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> before the PNP Regional Office in Canlubang declaring that she had seen appellant sexually assaulting her.<br><br>Finding for the prosecution, the trial court convicted appellant by the assailed decision of January 6, 1999, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5487-97-C, this Court finds accused Oscar Calamlam, Sr. GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua.<br><br>Accused is further ordered to indemnify the victim AAA the sum of P50,000.00 as moral and compensatory damages.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 5488-97-C, this Court finds accused Oscar Calamlam, Sr. GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua.<br><br>Accused is further ordered to indemnify the victim the sum of P50,000.00 as moral and compensatory damages.<br><br>With costs against the accused in both cases.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Hence, the present appeal, appellant assigning the following errors to the trial court:<br><blockquote>I. THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF TWO COUNTS OF RAPE.<br><br>II. THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO INDEMNIFY VICTIM IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF P100,000.00 AS MORAL AND COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>Appellant posits that AAA's charges are rendered suspect by the delay of almost eight years in filing them from the alleged occurrence of the first rape incident; that AAA's return to their residence, even after the alleged first rape incident, despite the fact that she was already boarding in a house near her place of work, casts serious doubt on her charges;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> that it would be impossible for him to have committed the crimes since they lived in one compound with AAA's maternal grandmother and aunt; that her testimony that she did not tell anyone of the rape incidents because she did not want to involve anyone runs counter to her friend Lychin Rivel's testimony that she (AAA) tearfully told her that she would commit suicide if said friend did not help her;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and that the information charging him with the first count of rape does not state the date of the commission of the crime with sufficient certainty as to give him an opportunity to prepare for his defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>After a considered review of the records of these two cases, this Court finds that the appeal is meritorious with respect to the second count of rape but not with respect to the first.<br><br>AAA's account of the first rape incident is clear and candid, punctuated with tears:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top">Q: </td> <td width="90%">The date of September 1989 do you recall of any unusual incident that happened to you?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="center">x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A:</td> <td> The rape sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>Who raped you?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>A: My father.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>When you said your father who is your father?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Oscar Calamlam Sr.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>In what place were you raped?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>In our house located in Maahas.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>More or less what time was it?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Between 12:15 to 12:30 sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>Midnight?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A:</td> <td>Noon your honor.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>In what portion of the house were you raped by your father?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Inside our room.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>Can you tell us in brief how your father was able to rape you in your own house in September 1989?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>I have just came (sic) from the school then at 12:15 noon so I came to the house and I was surprised he was alone.

delay on AAA's part in reporting the incident does not dent her credibility.&nbsp; Failure or delay in reporting a carnal violation committed by a father against his daughter due to threats is hardly unjustified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> For the father's moral ascendancy can lead the daughter to suffer in silence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><blockquote>In a long line of cases, this Court has held that delay in reporting rape incidents, in the face of threats of physical violence, cannot be taken against the victim.&nbsp; A rape victim's actions are oftentimes overwhelmed by fear rather than by reason.&nbsp; It is this fear, springing from the initial rape, that the perpetrator hopes to build a climate of extreme psychological terror, which would, he hopes, numb his victim into silence and submissiveness.&nbsp; Incestuous rape magnifies this terror, because the perpetrator is a person normally expected to give solace and protection to the victim.&nbsp; Furthermore, in incest, access to the victim is guaranteed by the blood relationship, proximity magnifying the sense of helplessness and the degree of fear.<br><br><center>x x x</center><br>The pattern of instilling fear and terror, utilized by the perpetrator in incestuous rape to intimidate his victim into submission is evident in virtually all similar cases which have reached this Court: the rapist perverts whatever moral ascendancy and influence he has over his victim in order to intimidate and force the latter to submit to repeated acts of rape over a period of time.&nbsp; In many instances, he succeeds and the crime is forever kept on a lid.&nbsp; In a few cases, the victim suddenly finds the will to summon unknown sources of courage to cry out for help and bring her depraved malefactor to justice.<br><br>Given this pattern, we have repeatedly ruled that the failure of the victim to immediately report the rape is not indicative of fabrication.<br><br><center>x x x<br><br></center>In all of these and other cases of incestuous rape, the perpetrator takes full advantage of his blood relationship, ascendancy, and influence over his victim, both to commit the sexual assault and to intimidate the victim into silence.&nbsp; Unfortunately for some perpetrators of incestuous rape, their victims manage to break out from the cycle of fear and terror.&nbsp; In <i>People v. Molero</i>, we emphasized that "an intimidated person cowed into submitting to a series of repulsive acts may acquire some courage as she grows older and finally state that enough is enough, the depraved malefactor must be punished."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>Thus, AAA's delay in reporting the first rape incident can be attributed to the fear instilled in her by the incessant threats and intimidation, not to mention the constant physical abuse inflicted on her by appellant who undoubtedly exercises moral ascendancy over her.&nbsp; It was commonsensical that she feared the wrath of appellant who, by his own admission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> had absolutely no qualms in using physical force against members of his family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> That fear could have indeed overcome AAA is not difficult to believe as appellant was in possession of two guns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>With respect to appellant's contention that AAA's allegations are rendered dubious in light of her return to their residence after the first rape incident despite the fact the she was staying at another house, AAA proffered a satisfactory explanation —&nbsp; hat she was forced by appellant to leave that house which was being rented by her friend Susan Layos where she initially sought refuge:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top">Q: </td> <td width="90%">Where is this house of Susan Layos? </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>She was renting that house located at Checkpoint at the back of bulalohan.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>Where is this Checkpoint?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>Mapayapa sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>You said your father sometime on (sic) January went there and poked a gun (sic) at you, can you tell us how he came to know the place where you were living where Susan Layos was boarding?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>He told me he saw me when he went to bulalohan to meet somebody. I was at the bathroom then when he came to the house and he entered the house asking Susan Layos of my whereabouts and Susan Layos told him that she will call me but he did not wait for Susan Layos to call me then he rushed on (sic) the bathroom and poked a knife at me. He told me if I will not go with him he will kill me so Susan Layos told me to go with my father because she was afraid.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Q: </td> <td>You said that because of what your father did Susan Layos was so scared that she asked you to go with your father?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>At first I told Susan Layos I will not go with my father but Susan Layos told me to go with him because she was afraid then. I was still talking with Susan when my father slapped me so I went with him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>AAA went on to declare that after that slapping incident, she managed to escape from appellant's clutches by staying at a boarding house near her place of work, but appellant again fetched her, telling her that her youngest brother, to whom she was very close, was very sick.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As to appellant's submission that it was impossible for him to commit rape in light of the presence of AAA's maternal grandmother and aunt in the same compound where he and his family live, the same does not lie.&nbsp; Lust is no respecter of time and place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Just as presence of people nearby<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> or suitability of the place is no deterrent to the commission of rape.<br><br>The perceived inconsistency between the testimony of AAA that she told no one of the rape and that of her friend Lychin Rivel that she (AAA) divulged to her has nothing to do with the essential fact of the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Respecting appellant's argument that the allegation in the first information relative to the date of the commission of the crime is not sufficiently definite to give him opportunity to prepare for his defense, the same is bereft of merit.&nbsp; Allegation of the exact time or date of the commission of a crime is not important in a prosecution for rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> it having no substantial bearing on its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> That is why under the Rules on Criminal Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> it is not necessary for the information to allege the date and time of the commission of the crime with exactitude except when the time is an essential ingredient thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Finally, clutching at straws, appellant imputes ill-motive on AAA, alleging that she filed the cases out of vengeance for having beaten her.&nbsp; Thus appellant claimed as follows, quoted <i>verbatim</i>:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%" valign="top">Q: </td> <td width="90%">You said a while ago that your daughter, the complainant in this case has a kissmark, when did you find this kissmark if you can still remember? </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A: </td> <td>I could recall that it happened between the month of April and May. I remember when she came home I saw that kissmark and she was also putting ice on her face.
