				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For automatic review is the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 109,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> imposing the death penalty on convicted appellant Diosdado Corial y Requiez for the crime of qualified rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> said to have been committed, according to the indictment, against his own minor granddaughter Maricar Corial.<br><br>At his arraignment, appellant pleaded "not guilty" to the charge;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> trial ensued shortly thereafter.<br><br><b>The Case for the Prosecution. —</b><br><br>Maricar Corial was born to Marietta Corial, appellant's daughter, but she did not come to know her father (now said to be deceased).&nbsp; Maricar had two maternal sisters who lived with their mother and her "stepfather" in Balagtas, Bulacan.&nbsp; Maricar lived with her grandparents, herein appellant and his wife Carmelita, in Pasay City.<br><br>One afternoon in July 1998, Maricar and appellant were left alone in the house.&nbsp; She was wearing a duster when her grandfather forced himself on her. He first inserted his penis into her private part, and then into her mouth and, finally, into her anus.&nbsp; When her mother, Marietta, arrived for Christmas in 1998, Maricar revealed the sexual abuse she had suffered from her grandfather.&nbsp; Maricar went first to the barangay hall where she lodged a complaint against appellant and then to the Philippine General Hospital where Maricar was physically examined.&nbsp; Still later, they repaired to the Pasay City Police station where Maricar executed a sworn statement (<i>salaysay</i>).<br><br>According to barangay captain Policarpio Tawat, Marietta and Maricar went to see him on the morning of 29 December 1998 at the <i>barangay</i> hall to seek assistance about the sexual assault.&nbsp; Along with a barangay <i>kagawad</i>, Tawat went to invite appellant to the barangay hall and then had a medical examination conducted on Maricar. When the medical examination proved positive for rape, Tawat turned appellant over to the Pasay City Police station.<br><br>The Provisional Medical Certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 29 December 1998, showed the following findings of Dr. Mariella Sugue-Castillo; <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">"GENITAL EXAMINATION: </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">External genitalia: normal</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>Hymen: crescentic hymen, no discharge seen, (+) mound at 7 o'clock position, (+) attenuation of posterior hymen</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>Anus: normal findings</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">"IMPRESSION</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>Disclosure of sexual abuse.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>Genital finding of posterior hymen attenuation is suspicious for prior penetration injury"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On the afternoon of 29 December 1998, SPO3 Milagros Carrasco was at the Women and Children Desk of the Pasay City Police station when <i>Barangay </i>Captain Tawat, Marietta, young Maricar, and Marietta's father arrived. After hearing the story, SPO3 Carrasco contacted social worker Erlinda Aguila to assist her in conducting the interview with Maricar.&nbsp; The child claimed that her maternal grandfather had sexually abused her. When confronted by SPO3 Carrasco, appellant remarked in Tagalog that he was just having a "taste" of the child (<i>tinitikman</i> <i>niya lang</i>). &nbsp;<br><br><b>The Case for the Defense. —</b><br><br>Testifying for her father, Nelly Corial stated that the 59-year-old appellant had six children, all of them female, by his wife Carmelita.&nbsp; He was a mason and construction worker employed by D. M. Consunji while her mother was a dressmaker.&nbsp; Her father was a responsible person with no vices.&nbsp; Her parents first took custody of Maricar because the latter's father, Francisco Amado and live-in partner of Marietta, would often inflict physical harm upon the child.&nbsp; After Francisco's death, Marietta resided in Balagtas, Bulacan, with yet another live-in partner, Rene Malinao, who both for a while took Maricar into their custody.&nbsp; Maricar was soon brought back to her grandparent's residence in Pasay City because of the maltreatment she had been getting from Malinao.&nbsp; According to Nelly, her parents loved Maricar, provided for her needs, and had her take up schooling at the Pio del Pilar Elementary School. After the case against appellant was filed, Marietta confided to Nelly her regrets (<i>nagsisisi</i>) for having filed the case.&nbsp; Marietta became "mentally deranged" and would harm herself for no reason at all.&nbsp; She concluded that Marietta's complaint was fabricated (<i>gawa-gawa lamang niya iyun</i>).&nbsp; Menchu, another daughter of appellant, also testified for him. Her residence in Pasay City was separated from appellant's house only by a wall. She confirmed that Maricar was brought to San Pedro, Laguna, at the instance of appellant who had wanted the child to have a vacation there.<br><br>Appellant denied having raped Maricar. He took the child away from her parents because they were unable to properly care for her.&nbsp; After Francisco's death, he took custody of Marietta and her child but only for four months when Marietta started to live with another partner in Bulacan. Marietta was a good daughter and a good mother but she was mentally ill and hardheaded (<i>suwail</i>). Marietta instigated the case against him because he had refused to allow her to live in their house in Pasay City.&nbsp; From Monday to Saturday, he would leave the house at six o'clock in the morning and return from work at seven o'clock in the evening. On Sundays, Nelly would always be at home.<br><br><b>The Assailed Decision. —</b><br><br>The trial court debunked the defense of denial interposed by appellant and the assertion that the rape case was only trumped-up by his daughter Marietta. It instead gave credence to what it so described as the "spontaneous and straightforward" testimony of Maricar Corial.&nbsp; The trial court adjudged:<br><blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing, the Court opines that the prosecution has proven the guilt of the accused, Diosdado Corial y Requiez for rape as defined and penalized under Art. 266-A and 266-B of RA 8353 as amended, and the Court hereby sentences the accused, Diosdado Corial y Requiez to death and to indemnify the complainant in the amount of P75,000.00 and moral and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Appellant, in this Court's review of his case, would consider erroneous his conviction for there was no opportunity for him and his granddaughter to be alone in their residence, particularly on Sundays when all the members of the household stayed home, and for Maricar's failure to make an outcry during the alleged sexual assault that could have easily attracted the attention of close kins whose house was only adjacent to theirs.<br><br>Quite often, this Court has held that rapists are not deterred from committing the odious act of sexual abuse by the mere presence nearby of people or even family members.&nbsp; Rape is committed not exclusively in seclusion;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> lust, it is said, respects neither time nor place. The trial court has valued Maricar's testimony as being "spontaneous and straightforward." Indeed, when a victim's testimony is straightforward and unflawed by any major inconsistency or contradiction, the same must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Appellant capitalizes on the so-called disparity between the declaration of Maricar in her testimony in court and her sworn statement.&nbsp; He quotes a portion of her <i>salaysay; viz:</i><br><blockquote><i>"06. T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natatandaan mo ba kung kailan at kung saan nangyari ang mga ginawa na sinasabi ng lolo mo sa iyo?</i><br><br><i>S:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opo, simula po ng Grade II ako. Tapos naulit po nuong July 1998 at nauulit po pag araw ng Linggo pag wala ang lola ko at ang tita ko sa bahay namin. Kasi nagtratrabaho si Lolo ng Lunes hanggang Sabado. Pero pag wala siyang pasok ay ginagalaw din niya ako. Sa bahay namin sa Dolores, Pasay.</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></i></blockquote>He then labels it as being inconsistent with her testimony on cross-examination; <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top">"Atty. Casas: </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">Now, it was in July 1998 which is finally the alleged (sic) contained in the information that you claimed you have been sexually molested, is that correct?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"A: </td> <td>Yes, sir.</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q: </td> <td>And you told the Court in your direct examination that it was the first time that the same was committed?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"A: </td> <td>Yes, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Not only is her assailed statement <b>—</b> that before the July 1998 incident she has also been subjected to sexual assault by appellant <b>—</b> inconsequential in a material point but it also does not necessarily take away her credibility at the witness stand. It is acknowledged that affidavits, usually taken <i>ex </i><i>parte</i>, are often held unreliable for being incomplete and inaccurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <br><br>Maricar's failure to shout during the sexual assault is not all that strange.&nbsp; Not every witness to or victim of a crime can be supposed to always act in conformity with the usual expectations of everyone;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in fact, there is no known and accepted standard therefor.&nbsp; Moreover, to attribute to her the sophistication of an adult woman would be to brush aside the fact that Maricar is just a young girl.&nbsp; Even then, it would be unreasonable to judge her actions on the traumatic experience by any norm of behavior that, if at all, may be expected from mature persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded by the claim of appellant that Marietta, the victim's mother, has fabricated the charge simply because appellant did not allow her to stay with him. It just is not a convincing tale. It is difficult to believe that Marietta would send his own father to jail, even to the gallows, sacrifice the honor and dignity of their family and subject her own child to untold humiliation and disgrace if she were motivated by any desire other than to bring to justice the person responsible for defiling her child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Appellant's claim that Marietta is deranged lacks unbiased evidentiary support.&nbsp; In any event, it hardly has any bearing on the credibility of her own daughter.&nbsp; Nor would the failure of the prosecution to present Marietta at the witness stand adversely affect the outcome of the case.&nbsp; The prosecution is not bound to present any witness other than the victim herself, for as long as the testimony of the victim is credible, natural, convincing and otherwise consistent with human nature and the course of things,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> it may be the basis for a conviction. It is the prerogative of the prosecution, not much unlike that of the defense, to determine which evidence to submit in support of its own case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Maricar, on direct examination, testified thusly:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q: </td> <td width="90%">In the information filed to (sic) this Honorable Court, stated that you are complaining for rape perpetrated by your Lolo Diosdado Corial that happened in July 1998.
