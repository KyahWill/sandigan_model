Roberta Cokin, nicknamed Obing, is a rich Filipino-Chinese businesswoman with business interests in Bacolod City and in the province and City of Iloilo. These varied business interest include a grocery store, commercial buildings, real estate and agricultural landholdings. Roberta or "Obing" as she is fondly called, lives together with her only surviving sister, Teresita Cokin, in their house at Mercedes St., in Bacolod City. Both Roberta and Teresita are spinsters.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>At about 11:45 in the evening of July 15, 1995, Roberta passed by her cockfarm situated in front of the Bacolod City National High School along Libertad Street (now Henares Street) in Bacolod City. She came from the Tangub cockpit where she attended a cockfight and she was alone driving by herself a Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up.</p> <p>Roberta never made it home. A group of armed men came and took away Roberta and her pick-up. On the following morning, Teresita Cokin, Roberta's younger sister, saw the abandoned Hi-Lux pick-up in front of the San Sebastian Cathedral. Later, Teresita received a telephone call from one identifying himself as Bravo, informing her that Roberta was kidnapped and would be released only after a One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00) ransom is paid.</p> <p>Andres Sumpay, the nephew of Roberta Cokin, was at the Cokin grocery early in the morning of July 15, 1995. He was minding the store when he noticed a man pacing the sidewalk in front of the store. The man later identified as the accused John Mamarion, handed over to Andres a plastic bag containing some papers. When this bag was later opened by Teresita Cokin, it contained the driver's license of Roberta. Inserted in the jacket cover of the driver's license of Roberta (Exh. I), is the ransom note (Exh J), a piece of yellow pad paper on which appears, in Roberta's own handwriting, the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>Teresita, please give the bearer One Million (P1,000,000.00) for I am kidnap by them. Don't tell the police or any law enforcer for my security reason." (Sgd) Obing. "Please produce immediately. Same"</p> </blockquote> <p>Teresita had in mind to follow Obing's instruction and keep the police out of the incident but without her knowledge, her nephew, Andres Sumpay, with the help of a family friend a retired policeman Graciano Reyes, reported the kidnapping to the NBI. Teresita was at first furious when the NBI started to investigate but as she could do nothing more, she accepted and welcomed the NBI's intervention.</p> <p>The NBI sought the assistance of the Bacolod Anti-Syndicated Crime Unit (BASCU) a unit of the Bacolod City Police specifically organized for the purpose of going after syndicated crimes and big-time criminals. The NBI set up shop in the house of Cokin and monitored the calls made by the kidnappers.</p> <p>When Bravo made follow-up calls for the payment of the ransom money, Teresita, following the instructions of the NBI, demanded that she be allowed to talk with her sister. Teresita heard the voice of Roberta over the telephone but their conversation was very brief. All that Roberta said was for her sister to be obedient to the wishes of her kidnappers. Bravo thereafter told Teresita that the ransom money is raised to Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00). The NBI monitoring the call failed to trace its origin as the call was made with the use of a cellular telephone.</p> <p>Bravo's last call was made in the afternoon of July 20, 1995. Teresita had already raised the amount of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) in cash and Bravo wants the money to be delivered at the Holiday Restaurant in the place which is known as the Shopping Center. The person who is carrying the money should wear a red cap and the money should be given to one who will identify himself as Bravo. The pay-off time was at 5:30 p.m.</p> <p>The NBI and the BASCU laid out a plan to apprehend the kidnappers and recover the ransom money during the pay-off. An NBI agent, Ed Rasco, together with a Bacolod City policeman, concealed themselves inside the KC-20 pick-up car driven by Mario Mahusay when the latter left to deliver the ransom money. Other BASCU personnel posted themselves at strategic places around Holiday Restaurant.</p> <p>Mario Mahusay was very conspicuous with his red cap inside the Holiday Restaurant at about 5:30 p.m. that day, July 20, 1995. When the restaurant's telephone rung, Mario was told that someone would like to talk with him. It was Bravo on the other end of the line and he instructed Mario to take a taxi and proceed to the Tops Bowling Lanes which is about a little less than a kilometer away.</p> <p>Fortuitously, a taxi was on hand when Mario stepped out of the restaurant. Mario boarded the taxi and it immediately sped away.</p> <p>The NBI and the BASCU men were caught unprepared by the sudden turn of events. Their communication system heated up with frenzied calls and instructions. Jumping on their vehicles, they sped northward following the route taken by the taxi.</p> <p>The taxi, with Mario Mahusay on board, stopped in front of Tops Bowling Lanes and Mario alighted. He went inside the building and waited. He did not wait long as in a few moments, a man came and identified himself as Bravo. Mario delivered the bags containing the Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) to the man who took them. The man gave Mario P50.00 and they both left the premises of Tops.</p> <p>The BASCU team, on board their service vehicle, found no trace of the taxi. They proceeded to the Ceres bus terminal at the Shopping Center and looked over the buses and the passengers hoping to find suspicious looking characters. Not finding any, they again boarded their service vehicle and moved towards the direction of the Queen of Peace Church (Hua Ming Church). The church is just near the Top's Bowling Alley.</p> <p>Before the BASCU team could reach the vicinity of the church, they chanced upon a man with a bag walking hurriedly. When accosted, the man fired at the BASCU team. After a brief firefight and the explosion of a grenade, the man was subdued. The bags containing the ransom money were recovered. The BASCU team also took from the man a .357 caliber homemade revolver with ammunitions and a holster (Exhs. A, B, C and D). The man was later identified as John Mamarion.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>The firearm recovered from Mamarion (Exh. A) was marked by Officer Tubongbanua with the initial "JM" and it was indorsed to the NBI together with the live ammunitions (Exh. B), the spent shells (Exh. C) and the holster (Exh. D). The bags containing the ransom money was also turned over to the NBI.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>The remains of Obing Cokin was discovered in a shallow grave in a secluded area of a sugarcane plantation in the town of Anilao, Iloilo on August 7, 1995. . . .</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>Teresita Cokin positively identified the corpse to be that of her elder sister, Obing. There is absolutely no doubt in this identification as Teresita is intimately familiar with the features of her sister, including her dentures. Moreover, she knew the blouse of Obing which has a red and white fish design and a long sleeve. Accordingly, Teresita executed an affidavit of identification allowing Dr. Ricardo H. Jaboneta, Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI to autopsy the remains of Roberta Cokin.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>Roberta died of "Traumatic shock, secondary to multiple physical injuries." The autopsy was conducted on August 8, 1995. Dr. Jaboneta opines that Roberta died not earlier than August 1, 1995 and not later then August 5, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>The trial court relied principally on the testimony of Gale together with the corroborating testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses, namely: Andres Sumpay, Teresita Cokin and Mario Mahusay as to appellant Mamarion, establishing the participation of appellants in the commission of the crime of Kidnapping with Ransom, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="5%">(1)</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">June 18, 1995 — accused Ronaldo Porquez (at-large) together with appellants <em>John Mamarion and Charlito Domingo</em>, John's brother, Felipe "<em>Oloy</em>" Mamarion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and Gale, held a meeting at the Ocean City Restaurant in Iloilo City wherein Porquez introduced the plan of kidnapping Roberta Cokin for the ransom of one million pesos to be participated in by the group as follows — Porquez will finance the operation in Iloilo City, Gale will identify the victim and monitor her activities and the brothers Mamarion and Domingo were the ones who will abduct the victim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">(2)</td> <td><div align="justify">June 19 to 22, 1995 — the group, consisting of the brothers <em>Mamarion, Domingo</em> and Gale, went around Iloilo and Bacolod City looking for a safehouse but was not successful; while they were in Bacolod City, the group used the Mitsubishi Lancer driven by Gale and owned by his cousin, Atty.

However, it recommends that the award of civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 should be shouldered by <em>each</em> of the appellants, following the award made by the Court in <em>People vs. Yambot</em>, G.R. No. 120350, October 13, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p> <p>The Court will first determine whether or not the trial court erred in allowing Gale to plead to a lesser offense in consideration of testifying as a prosecution witness.</p> <p>Appellants assail Gale's plea to a lesser offense arguing that it should have been made during the plea bargaining stage of the trial and that it should not be subject to the condition that he will testify against appellants. In the Brief for the State, the OSG maintains that Gale was validly discharged as a state witness. Under the circumstances, it is not correct to state that Gale was discharged as a state witness under Section 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court. Gale was allowed to change his plea pursuant to the then prevailing Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> which provided:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sec. 2. <em>Plea of guilty to a lesser offense.</em> — The accused, with the consent of the offended party and the fiscal, may be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense, regardless of whether or not it is necessarily included in the crime charges, or is cognizable by a court of lesser jurisdiction than the trial court. No amendment of the complaint or information is necessary.</p> <p>A conviction under this plea, shall be equivalent to a conviction of the offense charged for purposes of double jeopardy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Records show that during the May 13, 1997 hearing, the Chief State Prosecutor manifested that he has approved Gale's motion to be allowed to plead to a lesser offense, <em>i.e.</em> Slight Illegal Detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Private complainant Teresita Cokin, upon query of the trial court, consented to Gale's offer of plea to a lesser offense Slight Illegal Detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p> <p>It is immaterial that said plea was not made during the pre-trial stage or that it was made only after the prosecution already presented several witnesses. In <em>People vs. Villarama, Jr.,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> a 1992 case, the trial court allowed the accused therein to change his plea even after the prosecution had rested its case, applying the herein above-quoted Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court. The Court elucidated, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>Plea bargaining in criminal cases, is a process whereby the accused and the prosecution work out a mutually satisfactory disposition of the case subject to court approval. It usually involves the defendant's pleading guilty to a lesser offense or to only one or some of the counts of a multi-count indictment in return for a lighter sentence than that for the graver charge. Ordinarily, plea-bargaining is made during the pre-trial stage of the criminal proceedings. However, the law still permits the accused sufficient opportunity to change his plea thereafter. Thus, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court, Section 2 thereof, provides:</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>However, the acceptance of an offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense under the aforequoted rule is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter that is addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the trial court.</p> <p>In the case at bar, the private respondent (accused) moved to plead guilty to a lesser offense after the prosecution had already rested its case. <em>In such situation, jurisprudence has provided the trial court and the Office of the Prosecutor with a yardstick within which their discretion may be properly exercised. Thus, in <strong>People vs. Kayanan, we held that the rules allow such a plea only when the prosecution does not have sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the crime charged.</strong></em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p>Gale's testimony was crucial to the prosecution as there was no other direct evidence linking appellants to the commission of the crime. Hence, the trial court did not err in allowing Gale to plead guilty to a lesser offense.</p> <p> The Court will now determine: (1) whether or not the trial court erred in giving full faith and credit to the testimony of Gale; and (2) whether or not the participation and conspiracy of the four appellants in the commission of the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p>On the first issue:</p> <p>As a general rule, the testimony of a co-conspirator is not sufficient for the conviction of the accused unless other evidence supports such testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> There is, however, an exception to said rule. In <em>People vs. Sala</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court said:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is true that the testimony of a co-conspirator is not sufficient for the conviction of the accused unless such testimony is supported by other evidence. Such testimony comes from a polluted source and, therefore, must be received with caution. <em>As an exception, however, the testimony of a co-conspirator, even if uncorroborated, will be considered sufficient if given in a straightforward manner and it contains details which could not have been the result of deliberate afterthought.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Italics supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p>In upholding the credibility of Gale, the trial court stated in its decision, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>The testimony of Amado Gale on how the conspiracy to kidnap Roberta Cokin was hatched and implemented resounds with all the earmarks of sincerity and truth. His testimony is sox (<em>sic</em>) rich with details of persons, time, places and things and portrays with vivid imagery the action and the happenings as he saw them. This is the kind of testimony that carries the hallmarks of honesty and truth.</p> <blockquote> <p>Testimonies which are unequivocal, forthright and replete with details are seals of self-authentication in their credibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover, Amado Gale is only a driver whose educational attainment is only Grade II. It will require a good measure of ingenuity to invent a story of kidnapping, abundant with all the gory details, an ingenuity which Amado certainly do (<em>sic</em>) not possess.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> . . .</p> </blockquote> <p>Appellants take exception to such finding arguing that the prosecutors had previously rejected Gale's testimony during the second re-investigation and his testimony is incredible and full of inconsistencies. The Court is not convinced.</p> <p>The trial court's assessment of Gale as a credible witness and the credibility of his testimony is binding upon the Court. This is so because the trial court had the opportunity to observe and examine the witness' conduct and demeanor on the witness stand, having personally heard and observed him, and thus, it is in a better position to decide the question of his credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p> <p>A perusal of the transcripts of Gale's testimony confirms the trial court's assessment. Notably, Gale testified twice. The first time was against appellants Mamarion and Domingo as well as accused Villarosa and Leysa. The second instance was against appellants Maclang and Harisco, and, accused Mendoza. All throughout his testimony, his narration of the events, from the moment he was first taken in by the group on June 18, 1995 up to the time he was fetched by his wife and the authorities in Laguna on September 25, 1995, Gale was consistent in his account. Even during the rigorous cross-examination conducted by appellants' counsel, Gale was steadfast in his account of the commission of the crime and the participation of all appellants.</p> <p>The fact that the trial court found the testimony of another prosecution witness Ruperto Legarda, Jr. to be replete with inconsistencies and incongruities pertaining to significant and important details and "suffers from serious improbabilities" does not lessen the credibility of Gale.</p> <p>The testimony of Gale, sans that of Legarda, Jr., is sufficient to convict appellants. Truth is established not by the number of witnesses but by the quality of their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The testimony of a single witness if positive and credible is sufficient to support a conviction, as convictions rest not on the number of witnesses, but on the credibility of the testimony of even one witness who is able to convince the court of the guilt of the accused beyond a shadow of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p> <p>Appellants Maclang and Harisco insist that Gale's testimony is incredible and replete with inconsistencies. They maintain that Gale was inconsistent when: (1) he testified on July 7, 1997 that he saw Maclang for the first time in the morning of June 22, 1995 at the duplex seated at the balcony; while during his December 17, 1997 testimony, he said that when he fetched Mamarion's group on June 22, 1995 at the duplex, he saw Maclang seated on the chair facing the table, and that he already knew Maclang because the latter used to attend occasions hosted by Porquez for whom Gale used to work;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (2) he did not state in his July 7, 1997 testimony when and where the kidnapping will take place as discussed during their July 10, 1995 meeting; while in his December 17, 1997 testimony, he specified that Maclang said on July 10, 1995 that Roberta Cokin will be kidnapped on July 15, 1995 at the Tangub cockpit;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and (3) during the August 8, 1996 re-investigation, he said that Mamarion and Roger Biona informed him that the duplex house was owned by appellant Harisco, while when further examined, he said that he found out that the duplex was owned by Harisco only after his affidavit was taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> <p>These alleged inconsistencies, if they can be considered as such, are negligible and merely refer to minor details that do not bear relevance on the material and significant fact that appellants were part of the group which concocted and carried out the kidnapping of Roberta Cokin.</p> <p>Moreover, while it is true that, Gale did not state during his July 7, 1997 testimony that the details of the kidnapping were discussed during the group's July 10, 1995 breakfast meeting at the duplex house, it is because the prosecution did not ask him particularly as to what took place during such breakfast conference. What was asked of him during that portion of his direct examination merely pertained to his companions at that time, thus:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="10%">Q</td> <td width="90%">Now, on July 10, 1995 in the morning, where were you?</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">WITNESS:</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">A</td> <td><div align="justify">On July 10, I went to the Duplex house to fetch John Mamarion <em>alias</em> "Oloy" and Roger Biona.

Such testimony prevails over the affidavits which Gale previously executed. It is settled that whenever there is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight considering that affidavits taken <em>ex parte</em> are inferior to testimony given in court, the former being almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p> <p>Moreover, delay in revealing the identity of the perpetrators of a crime does not necessarily impair the credibility of a witness, especially where the delay is explained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Gale was able to satisfactorily explain why he did not name or identify Maclang and Harisco in his affidavits and during the re-investigation of the case. On cross-examination by counsel for appellant Maclang, Gale staunchly declared: "I purposely did not make mention of Major Maclang because the person who was taking my affidavit was a policeman and I am afraid because Major Maclang was also a policeman, I was afraid because even Oloy Mamarion, our companion was even killed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Gale further explained that he was afraid because Major Maclang and Juliet Harisco have warned him not to implicate them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Upon further questioning, Gale stated that he was not afraid anymore "because when my family had already left, I trusted myself to the Lord and I said to myself that I will tell the truth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, the omission of the names of appellants Maclang and Harisco by Gale in his affidavits does not demolish his credibility when he subsequently implicated them on the witness stand.</p> <p>Witnesses are usually reluctant to volunteer information about a criminal case or are unwilling to be involved in or dragged into criminal investigations due to a variety of valid reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Fear of the criminal is one such reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> On that account, Gale's fear was not without basis. In his testimony Gale revealed that on July 23, 1995, after arriving from Manila, several armed men went to his house in Old Escalante at around 11:00 p.m., and looked for him, but he hid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Meanwhile, his wife who likewise came from Manila on the same day, dropped by Benjie Bernaje's house, and there, Bernaje's' maid handed her a note coming from John Mamarion which contained two bullet slugs and read: "(T)his two (2) slugs let Amado eat this dispense slug."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Gale also received a death threat on May 8, 1996 during the re-investigation of the case at the City Prosecutor's office while he was in the comfort room and someone sidled up to him and handed him a note warning him not to name Maclang or else he will not return to Bacolod alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></p> <p>Gale's escorts, JO1 Leo Joven and JO1 Jose Gerard Simpas, testified that they did not see Gale leave Prosecutor Baldago's office at the Iloilo City Hall of Justice during the re-investigation on May 8, 1996, nor did they notice any unusual behavior on his part at the time he allegedly received the death threat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> This, however, should not be taken as proof that he did not actually receive those death threats. As the trial court aptly elucidated:</p> <blockquote> <p> . . . they certainly based their perception on the outward appearance and actuations of Amado. They certainly were not in the position to observe the anxiety on Amado's mind and fear that digs deep in Amado's heart. The Court observed Amado to be a quiet and pensive person. By keeping to himself and remaining quiet, Amado acted normally. Without claiming expertise on the field of human behavior, the Court is nevertheless convinced that Amado is the type who would remain outwardly quiet although an inner turmoil gnaws inveterately inside his guts.</p> <p>JO1 Joven declared that Amado did not leave the re-investigation room to go to the comfort room. The matter of Amado going to the comfort room during the re-investigation is so insignificant and trivial that it could not possibly leave a mark in Mr. Joven's memory. In any event, JO1 Joven left Amado Gale and the other detainee he was guarding (Charlito Domingo) when he bought coke and siopao on the ground floor of the building. JO1 Simpas also left the detainees when he purchased coffee for Amado who requested for the change of the coke to coffee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>There being no showing that Gale has any ill motive to testify against appellants, the presumption is that he was not so moved and his testimony was untainted with bias, and thus entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p> <p>In sum, the trial court did not commit any error when it gave probative weight and credence to Gale's testimony.</p> <p>On the second issue:</p> <p>The prosecution evidence clearly shows that appellants were conspirators in the perpetration of the kidnapping for ransom of Roberta Cokin. Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Appellants Mamarion's and Domingo's acts of monitoring the victim's activities, coordinating the abduction, handing the ransom note, collecting the ransom, and detaining Roberta Cokin; and the concerted acts of appellants Maclang and Harisco in giving instructions and providing funds for their operations, prove that they acted in concert in committing the crime. Appellants' individual participation, viewed in its totality, point to a joint purpose and criminal design. Thus, they are all equally liable given that in a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p> <p>Appellant Mamarion questions the failure of the prosecution to present the money allegedly paid as ransom. On this score, it must be pointed out that the <em>corpus delicti</em> in the crime of kidnapping for ransom does not pertain to the ransom money itself. It is the fact of the commission of the crime which may be proved by the testimony of the witnesses who saw it. To prove the <em>corpus delicti</em>, it is sufficient for the prosecution to be able to show that (1) a certain fact has been proven, and (2) a particular person is criminally responsible for the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></p> <p>From the evidence brought before the trial court, the name and participation of appellant Mamarion in the planning and execution of the crime of Kidnapping with Ransom consistently and persistently crop up.

In disregarding Harisco's alibi, the trial court found that her PAL plane ticket shows that the flight for Cebu on July 10, 1995 was scheduled to leave at 8:40 in the morning, and Harisco and her companion can be at the airport minutes before the flight such that her presence during the breakfast meeting at 5:30 in the morning cannot be foreclosed. Harisco, however, points out that the trial court was mistaken when it stated that the flight was at 8:40 in the morning, because the time reflected on the ticket refers to her connecting flight from Cebu to Zamboanga on the same date, not from Bacolod City to Cebu.</p> <p>On this score, the best evidence that would prove Harisco's flight details on July 10, 1995 would be the plane ticket itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> A review of Harisco's plane ticket indeed discloses that the 8:40 flight indicated therein pertains to the connecting flight from Cebu to Zamboanga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> However, there is nothing on record that will buttress Harisco's denial that she was present at the breakfast meeting as she had an early morning flight for Cebu. It must be pointed out that it devolves upon Harisco to prove the truth of her allegations, or denials, for that matter. Her plane ticket does not state the specific time of her flight from Bacolod to Cebu as said flight was booked with an open date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Harisco's witness, May Luzuriaga, testified that the flight from Bacolod to Cebu was at 6:10 in the morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> But further review of the evidence on record shows that the flight was in fact at 6:50 in the morning.

Absent proof therefore, Harisco's claim is reduced to an unsupported allegation that bears little persuasive effect, definitely insufficient to prevail over Gale's positive identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></p> <p>And even assuming that Harisco's flight was at 6:10 in the morning, it does not follow that it was physically impossible for her to negotiate the distance between her house and the airport.

The Court does not find any evidence that shows that the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the fact that appellant Harisco can be at the airport in a few minutes time thus making it possible for her to be in the breakfast meeting before going to the airport for the 6:10 a.m. flight, if indeed the flight of appellant Harisco from Bacolod City to Cebu was actually 6:10 in the morning of July 10, 1995.</p> <p>In the light of Gale's positive testimony that Harisco participated in the planning of the kidnapping and was present at the breakfast meeting on July 10, 1995, her defense of alibi must fail, especially when there is no showing that Gale had any improper motive to testify falsely against her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> or that it was physically impossible for her to be at the duplex during the meeting.</p> <p>Appellant Maclang denies any involvement, claiming that his indictment was politically motivated and that at the time the alleged conspiracy was brewing, he was already assigned in the Regional Special Office in Camp Delgado, Iloilo City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> and later at the Iloilo Police Provincial Command in Sta.

The facts and circumstances which indubitably show the participation of Major Maclang and Juliet Harisco in the conspiracy may be succinctly summed up, thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>1. Major Maclang is the benefactor of the accused John Mamarion whom he took in as an asset in the Task Force Iron Eagle of which he was the Operations Officer. John Mamarion also worked for Juliet Harisco in the latter's barter trade business. Both Maclang and Harisco exercised moral ascendancy and influence over Mamarion;</p> <p>2. Maj. Maclang is a friend of the accused Ronaldo Porquez. Porquez' participation in the conspiracy as instigator was duly established. If the kidnapping is to be segmented, Major Maclang and Juliet Harisco handles the Bacolod City segment while Porquez is in-charge of the Iloilo side. Porquez expressly made known to Mamarion and the kidnap group that in Bacolod City, Maj. Maclang and Juliet Harisco will answer for their expenses;</p> <p>3. Maclang and Harisco have an illicit affair and both stay at the duplex house at Homesite. John Mamarion and the kidnap group stay at the duplex house in the course of the preparations for the kidnapping;</p> <p>4. The fact that the kidnap group did not return to the duplex house after snatching Roberta reinforces the evidence of the duo's participation. This is too obvious to be further explained;</p> <p>5. Maclang and Harisco actually delivered moneys to John Mamarion which were spent during the preparations for the kidnapping;</p> <p>6. It was Maj. Maclang who ordered the kidnapping to be held on July 15, 1995 at the Tangub cockpit. Juliet Harisco pointed to John Mamarion reiterating his assigned role as the one who will actually snatch Roberta Cokin. This incident took place during the breakfast meeting at the duplex house in the morning of July 10, 1995. It was during that time when Major Maclang gave out a warning that whatever happens, his name should not be mentioned in connection with the kidnapping;</p> <p>7. After the filing of the charges against them, both Maclang and Harisco took flight and evaded arrest. They were arrested in the same house at Taytay, Rizal on October 25, 1997. As testified by Lt. Col. Rolando Lopez, both Maclang and Harisco occupy adjacent rooms at the upper portion of the building.</p> </blockquote> <p>The evidence clearly show that both Maj. Maclang and Juliet Harisco were aware of the filing of the present case against them and they both evaded arrest. Maclang's feeble explanation for his flight was that he was trying to recover the folder in the possession of Roger Biona as the documents therein contained would unravel the mystery of the Cokin kidnapping. This claim is too shallow and too nebulous as to be given any serious consideration. Harisco's explanation is that she could not accept being charged for a crime she did not commit. This explanation wilts and fades in illuminating brightness of clear and positive evidence pointing to her participation in the kidnap-slay as a principal by inducement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Both appellants Maclang and Harisco argue that: (1) it is inconceivable that they should be involved in a crime involving such a measly mount considering that Harisco is engaged in a successful business and owns several properties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> and that Maclang is a be-medalled military officer;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (2) Harisco has no motive for committing the crime;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> (3) the bungled crime cannot be the handiwork of an experienced military man like Maclang;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> (4) it is illogical that Maclang will allow Harisco to give instructions to the group when he is supposedly to be the one to do it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup></p> <p>These arguments, which are vain attempts on appellants' part to discredit Gale, are plain surmises and conjectures that pale in the light of Gale's positive identification and unwavering testimony. That Harisco is well-off is irrelevant. As the Court has declared in <em>People vs. Deang</em> possession of wealth does not make one a saint and poverty alone does not make one a criminal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Thus, lack of motive on the part of Harisco is a moot point in the face of the positive identification and testimony of Gale on Harisco's participation. Proof of ill motive to commit the crime then becomes irrelevant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Likewise, Maclang's so-called achievements do not necessarily connote that he is innocent of the crime charged or that he is incapable of committing it. An accused is not entitled to an acquittal simply because of his previous, or even present, good moral character and exemplary conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></p> <p>Under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 8 of R.A. No. 7659 kidnapping for ransom is penalized as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Kidnapping and serious illegal detention.</em> — Any private individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any manner deprive him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death:</p> <blockquote> <ol><li>If the kidnapping or detention shall have lasted more than five days. <p></p></li><li>If it shall have been committed simulating public authority.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>If any serious physical injuries shall have been inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained; or if threats to kill him shall have been made.<p></p> <p></p></li><li>If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, female or a public officer.</li></ol><p></p> </blockquote> <p><em>The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances above-mentioned were present in the commission of the offense.</em></p> <p><em>When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed.</em> (Italics supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p>The prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that appellants conspired to commit, and in fact, committed the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom, as charged in the Information. In addition, the prosecution adduced proof beyond reasonable doubt that as a consequence of the detention of the victim, she sustained physical injuries which resulted in her death. Applying Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, the appellants are criminally liable for the death of the victim. There being no evidence that any modifying circumstances attended the killing of the victim, the appellants are guilty only of the special complex crime of kidnapping for ransom with homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></p> <p>Kidnapping for ransom is punishable by death. Under the last paragraph of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, if the victim of the kidnapping dies as a result of her detention, the penalty is also death. However, since the appellants committed only one felony namely, the special complex crime of kidnapping for ransom with homicide, the appellant should be sentenced to only one death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup></p> <p>Three Justices of the Court maintain their position that R.A. No. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar.</p> <p>As regards the civil liability of appellants resulting from the death of Roberta Cokin, Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code is explicit: "(N)otwithstanding the provisions of the next preceding article, the principals, accomplices, and accessories, each within their respective class, shall be liable severally (<em>in solidum</em>) among themselves for their quotas, and subsidiarily liable for those of the other persons liable." Hence, the trial court did not err in declaring that appellants' liability for the civil indemnity, as principals, is solidary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> or joint and several.</p> <p>The trial court did not err in awarding P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for the death of Roberta Cokin.</p> <p>In addition, the trial court is correct in not awarding actual damages to the heirs of Roberta Cokin. While Teresita Cokin testified that she incurred and defrayed the expenses of transferring the remains of the victim from the funeral parlor in Anilao to Somo Funeral Home in Iloilo, no receipt or any document was presented in support thereof.</p> <p>However, the Court has ruled in recent cases that when no sufficient proof of actual damages is offered, the heirs of the victim may be awarded temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup></p> <p>The trial court is likewise correct in not awarding moral damages.
