				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In rejecting this appeal, the Court reiterates the well-entrenched rule that the factual findings of trial courts are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed unless they plainly overlooked or neglected material evidence which, if considered, will affect the disposition of the case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Case</b></u><br></div><br>Before us is an appeal from the October 6, 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan (Branch 82) in Criminal Case No. 16- M-95, convicting Dionisio Felipe and Ma.

During their arraignment on July 5, 1995, appellants, assisted by counsel <i>de oficio,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; pleaded not guilty after the Information had been read to them in a language that they fully understood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> After trial on the merits, the lower court promulgated its assailed Decision. Counsel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for appellants then filed the Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> on December 9, 1999.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br><br><b><u><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></u></b><br></div><br>In its Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution's version of the facts as follows:<br><blockquote> "About 10:00 in the evening of November 20, 1994, Willy, Gerardo, Randy and Eduardo, all surnamed Bagtas, were walking along the irrigation canal situated in Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan.&nbsp; They were going home from the wake of the late Bibang de los Reyes.&nbsp; Upon reaching the part of the feeder road where both sides are covered by about seven (7) feet tall `talahib' grasses, accused Eduardo Felipe and herein appellants suddenly emerged from the `talahib' grasses. Since the moon was brightly shining and being their neighbors, Willy, Gerardo and Randy were able to recognize them. As Eduardo Felipe was coming out from the `talahib' he uttered `wala na kayong ligtas' and suddenly hacked by the use of a scythe the neck of Eduardo Bagtas, which caused the latter to fall down on the ground.&nbsp; Appellants Lourdes and Dionisio uttered `[s]ige patayin mo, patayin mo.[']&nbsp; While blocking the road, appellants told the group `[h] uwag kayong makialam, pati kayo mamamatay.'&nbsp; Appellant Dionisio or Boy Bulag stated, `mamatay kayong lahat dahil galit kami sa mga Bagtas.'&nbsp; Willy, Gerardo and Randy were shocked and when they recovered their wits, they tried to help Eduardo Bagtas.&nbsp; But because of the threats of accused Eduardo Felipe and the two appellants, they got scared and ran away from where the victim Eduardo Bagtas was being hacked.<br><br>"On that same night of November 20, 1994, Hipolito Bagtas was irrigating his palay fields when suddenly Randy Bagtas emerged running and told him about the hacking incident.&nbsp; Thereafter, Hipolito went to the scene of the incident and saw, by the bright light of the moon, Eduardo Bagtas lying on the ground while still being hacked by accused Eduardo Felipe and being hit [by] a piece of wood by Dionisio Felipe. Hipolito saw the incident while he remained hidden by the `talahib' grasses. Hipolito heard appellant Lourdes Felipe saying, `[d]alian natin, umalis na tayo, baka tayo abutan.'<br><br>"The bloody cadaver of Eduardo Bagtas was brought in front of his father Almario's house at Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan.&nbsp; Out of anger, the Bagtas family shouted and threw stones at the house of Eduardo Felipe and appellants.<br><br>"Marifel Dulo, a common neighbor of the Bagtas and Felipe families, testified that about midnight of November 20, 1994, appellant Ma. Lourdes went to their house.&nbsp; Ma. Lourdes borrowed Marifel's t-shirt to change her blood-stained striped t-shirt.&nbsp; Marifel brought the already washed t-shirt left to her by Ma. Lourdes to SPO4 George Villena.&nbsp; The t-shirt was duly identified and marked as Exhibit `C'. The t-shirt which Marifel lent to Ma. Lourdes and later reacquired by her was likewise identified and marked as Exhibit `Q'.&nbsp; On that same night, Marifel executed her affidavit stating that appellant Ma. Lourdes told her, `[n]akapatay kami' and that when Ma. Lourdes said `kami' she was referring to [her] brother, appellant Dionisio, and nephew, accused Eduardo Felipe.&nbsp; Marifel also alleged that appellant also told her that same night that they killed Eduardo Bagtas in the field, which was only about 150 meters away from her house. Marifel is a good friend of appellant Ma. Lourdes.<br><br>"Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan Brgy. Captain Diogracias Francisco testified: When he went to the crime scene, he saw the victim dead, lying with his face towards the ground. On that same night, he and some policemen went to the house of appellant Ma. Lourdes and was told that the latter was sleeping. When appellant Ma. Lourdes was awakened and appeared, Francisco saw that there was mud all over said appellant's feet.&nbsp; He was told by appellant Ma. Lourdes, `I did not do it' and `lumusong nga ako at pinigil ko sila' in the presence of the policemen who were with him.<br><br>"Brgy. Captain Nestor Sangalang of Brgy. Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga (adjacent to Brgy. Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan) testified that between 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning of November 21, 1994, he saw appellant Dionisio Felipe or Boy Bulag pass by their Barangay.&nbsp; Having earlier been informed about the incident, Sangalang asked said appellant what he was doing in that place at that time.&nbsp; Appellant Dionisio replied, `sabit ako sa pagpatay'.&nbsp; Sangalang apprehended and surrendered said appellant to Brgy. Capt. Francisco.&nbsp; The incident of Sangalang's arrest of appellant Dionisio Felipe was entered in the Barangay Blotter of Brgy. Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga.<br><br>"Dr. Lilia C. Aure conducted the post mortem examination of victim Eduardo Bagtas and issued a Certificate of Death.<br><br>"Dr. Aure described in her testimony the wounds sustained by the victim, as follows:<br><blockquote> `The anterior position meaning the front of the body.&nbsp; To the neck is 1 cm. length and the total cut off is from here up to the back. Cut throat at the back neck meaning all the blood vessels, the esophagus, the trachea, the bronchia, all in all the air passage have been cut off totally, the skin left here is only 1 cm., the total cut off, that is why all the organs have been cut off and the upper extremities, the radical arteries are also cut off, both hands and the lower extremities, the anterior side and posterior side have multiple abrasions, numbering so many, as indicated in the diagram.'<br></blockquote>"Dr. [Aure] also testified that based on the nature of the injuries (hack wounds and abrasions), there were at least two or more persons who inflicted the wounds [on] the body of the victim.&nbsp; The hack wounds on the neck [were] inflicted by five (5) or more hack blows.&nbsp; The nature and number of the wounds indicate that the victim offered no resistance to his attackers.&nbsp; The wounds must have been caused by a `sharp instrument, sharp object or bladed' and `a piece of wood or a blunt instrument'.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"Before the incident in question, the accused Eduardo Felipe's family and the victim Eduardo Bagtas' family had a land boundary dispute.&nbsp; These two families were not in good terms also because the Bagtas family suspected that the Felipe family poisoned their chickens, and in turn, the Felipe family suspected that Almario Bagtas, the father of the victim Eduardo Bagtas, poisoned their chicken.&nbsp; Said quarrel between the two families is recorded in the barangay [b]lotter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><u style="font-weight: bold;"><i>Version of the Defense</i></u><br></div><br>Resorting to plain denial, appellants contend that their individual participation in the killing has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Further, there was no conspiracy, and the act of one should not be deemed the act of all.&nbsp; They summarize the evidence in their behalf as follows:<br><blockquote> "The first witness presented was the accused Ma. Lourdes Felipe who testified that on said date and time she was already in her house since 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon as she was very tired from her planting of palay in the farm of Olimpio Urbano. She did not leave her house until the evening of said date when she was [awakened] by her sister who told her that there were policemen looking for her together with Bgy. Captain Deogracias Francisco who told her to go with them to the Municipal Hall of San Miguel, Bulacan[,] telling her further that she was involved in the killing of Eduardo Bagtas. She denied having passed the house of Marifel Dulo on the night of November 24, 1994 and the reason why she has the T- shirt of Marifel [was] that it was given to her as a Christmas gift on December 1993 and denied having uttered the following words, `[d]alian natin, umalis na tayo, baka tayo abutan.'&nbsp; She denied any participation in the killing of Eduardo Bagtas.<br><br>"On cross-examination[,] she admitted having borrowed or given a T-shirt by Marifel which T-shirt according to her was given to her by Marifel on December 25, 1993 as a gift.&nbsp; She stated that she has not given any gift to any other person before 1994.<br><br>"For his defense, Dionisio Felipe testified as follows: He stated that he is a resident of Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan since birth.&nbsp; Between the hours of 10:00 to 11:00 o'clock in the evening of November 10, 1994, he was in their house at Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan and from 8:00 o'clock in the morning up to 9:00 in the evening, he was at San Fernando Pampanga, as he attended the [interment] of his relative.&nbsp; He was with Olimpio Urbano and Marciana Bagtas to attend the [interment] of his relative on that said date and upon his return from the [interment] of his relative, he drove the vehicle of Olimpio Urbano to convey passengers to their respective residences.&nbsp; After conveying or transporting his passengers, he arrived [at] his home at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening and after resting for a while, he transfer[red] to the house of his sister to rest which is just located more than one (1) meter away from his house. He rested and watched the television and slept there from 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning.&nbsp; While asleep, he was awakened by his sister Ma. Lourdes Felipe (Baby) from whom he came to know that he was being taken by the policemen to San Miguel, Bulacan. After he was awakened from the house of his sister Baby, he was taken by the policemen to fetch his brother-in-law and another sister by the name of Linda at Batasang Bata, but was not able to fetch them.&nbsp; He further testified that there is no truth [to] the testimony of Brgy. Captain Nestor Sanggalang of Brgy. Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga of the prosecution that when he met him, he told Brgy. Captain Sanggalang that `[n]asabit ako sa patayan' because the truth of the matter is that he was not able to get to the house of his sister on that time and date.<br><br>"On cross[-]examination, he admitted that he did not know the name of the deceased whose funeral he allegedly attended in San Fernando, Pampanga and who is not in any way related to him. When he suddenly decided to take the usual route in going to his sister and brother-in-law and passed by Brgy. Lourdes, he was confronted by unknown persons.<br><br>"In support of their defense, Marissa Velasquez testified that she is a resident of Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan[,] since birth up to the present.&nbsp; She knows Eduardo Felipe, one of the accused in this case who is still at large, being her cousin.&nbsp; On the evening of November 20, 1994, while she was in their house together with her family, Eduardo Felipe came to their house knocking their door rapidly and she opened the door.&nbsp; After she opened the door, she saw Eduardo Felipe bloodied and was asked by Eduardo Felipe to fetch his parents at Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan because he killed somebody.&nbsp; She was able to ask Eduardo Felipe who was killed by him and he answered Eduardo Bagtas.&nbsp; She further asked who are his companions and answered that he was alone.&nbsp; Because of his request to fetch his parents, she went to Batasang Matanda in the following morning to inform the parents of Eduardo Felipe and that they are being requested by Eduardo Felipe to fetch them.<br><br>"The last defense witness was Edna Reyes who testified that on November 20, 1994, she was in the house of her brother Glandino delos Reyes at Batasang Matanda, San Miguel, Bulacan at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening because her auntie died on that day. They attended the wake of [their] auntie at Batasang Matanda. [Her] brother invited them to sleep in their house with her father Joaquin delos Reyes and when they reached the house of her brother, it was already past 8:00 o'clock in the evening.&nbsp; Dionisio (Boy) Felipe and Ma. Lourdes (Baby) Felipe [were] in the house of [her] brother when they came.&nbsp; Baby Felipe was sleeping in the house near the house of her brother.&nbsp; At about past 10:00 o'clock in the evening, they heard two (2) gunshots and noise coming from the compound of the victim.&nbsp; Boy Felipe was there and later on her brother opened the door, so they heard the shoutings.&nbsp; At first she heard that somebody died and she heard the shout `Ed, bakit mo pinatay si Edward?'&nbsp; After she heard that noise, they learned that the house of Eduardo Felipe was being stoned.&nbsp; After a few minutes when she heard those shoutings, the police officers together with the Brgy. Captain of Batasang Matanda came and they proceeded to the compound of his brother because they want to talk to Baby Felipe.&nbsp; For them to talk to Baby Felipe, they instructed her sister-in-law Marciana to wake up Baby Felipe, who was already sleeping at that time. After Baby Felipe was awakened by her sister-in-law, Brgy. Captain and his companions brought Baby Felipe immediately to the Municipal Hall but Boy Felipe stayed in the house of her brother. When Baby Felipe immediately was brought by the Brgy. Captain and his companions, she started to panic and said that they have no involvement in the killing.&nbsp; Her sister-in-law followed Baby Felipe in the Municipal Hall where she was brought by the Brgy. Captain and his companions.&nbsp; Boy Felipe proceeded to the house of his brother to fetch the latter and she saw Boy Felipe when he left.&nbsp; She found out on the following day that Boy Felipe and Baby Felipe were arrested and incarcerated.<br><br>"On cross[-]examination, she stated that she only heard the voice of an old woman shouting, `Ed, bakit mo pinatay si Eduard' but she cannot recognize her because they did not do anything when the house of the assailants was being stoned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b><br></div><br>Confronted with a question of credibility, the trial court opted to give more weight to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; In particular, it described as unaffected and convincing the testimonies of the following: 1) Willy, Gerardo and Randy -- all surnamed Bagtas; 2) Marifel Dulo, a common neighbor of appellants and the victim; 3) Deogracias Francisco, the barangay captain who had gone to the house of Appellant Ma. Lourdes Felipe after the hacking incident; and 4) Dr. Lilia C. Aure, who had conducted the autopsy on the victim.<br><br>The court <i>a quo</i> ruled that the three accused had clearly acted in concert in killing the victim. It also dismissed appellants' denial and alibi, holding that such defenses could not prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br>Finally, the lower court held that the killing was qualified by treachery.&nbsp; However, it rejected the allegation of evident premeditation for insufficiency of evidence.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Issues</b></u><br></div><br>In their appeal, appellants raise the following alleged errors of the trial court:<br><br><blockquote> "I. The trial court gravely erred in holding that there was conspiracy among the accused.&nbsp;<br><br>"II. The trial court erred in not giving weight and credence to the testimony of all the defense witnesses, which if considered will lend a reasonable doubt on their guilt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The appeal is unmeritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Main Issue:</u></b><br><b><u><i>Prosecution Evidence Vis-à-Vis Conspiracy</i></u></b><br></div><br>The defense anchors its case on the testimony of Marisa Vasquez.&nbsp; She testified that on the night in question, Eduardo Felipe had gone to her house to ask her to fetch his parents.&nbsp; When she asked him what had happened, he admitted having killed Eduardo Bagtas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14] </sup> In reply to her question who his companions were, he said that he was alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Relying on this testimony, appellants now question the finding of conspiracy.&nbsp; They maintain that the only evidence that implicates Ma. Lourdes Felipe "was her dirty feet, and when summoned by the police, she was there in her house already sleeping."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As in most criminal cases, the crux of the controversy lies in the evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, the lower court based its decision on the positive and categorical testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; It ruled as follows:<br><blockquote> "The Court finds no cause to doubt the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who were keenly perceived by the Court to have delivered narrations of the events and their observations of what transpired in their presence in a direct, unaffected and convincing manner x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [18]</sup></blockquote>After judiciously reviewing the testimonies of all the witnesses, we find no cogent reason to reject the trial court's evaluation.&nbsp; The three key ones presented by the government were the actual companions of the victim on the night he was killed.&nbsp; Willy Bagtas testified in this manner:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"Atty.

Precisely because of the unusual acts of violence committed right before their eyes, they remembered with a high degree of reliability the identities of the criminals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> This Court has noted that in many crimes of violence, the most natural reaction of persons involved in an attack -- either instinctively or as a means to fend off any further attack -- is to strive to see the faces and the appearances of the assailants,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> to observe the manner in which the crime is committed, and to approximate what might be the latter's next move.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Time and time again, this Court has declared that when the issue is one of credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies, the findings of a trial court will generally not be disturbed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts or circumstances of substance and value which, if considered, might well affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This doctrine is premised on the undisputed fact that the trial court had the best opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while they were on the stand; thus, it was in the best position to discern whether they were telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31] </sup> Appellants have not given the Court sufficient reason to deviate from this doctrine.<br><br>They deny any participation in the death of Eduardo Bagtas, maintaining that it was Eduardo Felipe who actually hacked and killed the victim.&nbsp; According to appellants, the testimony of their witness, Marisa Velasquez, showed that there was no conspiracy among them. Hence, they pass the blame to their co- accused in the belief that the latter, who has not yet been apprehended, will be in no position to contradict their assertions.&nbsp; This Court notes, though, the patent weakness of their arguments.<br><br><i>First</i>, appellants' defenses contradict one another, to say the least.&nbsp; They testified that they had not been present at the <i>locus criminis.</i> In their Brief, however, they argue that the prosecution failed to prove their active participation in the killing, thus impliedly admitting their presence therein and contradicting their testimonies.&nbsp; Interestingly, they even cite cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> holding that mere presence during the commission of the crime is insufficient to prove conspiracy. By applying these cases, they necessarily abandon their stand that they were not present when the victim was killed.<br><br>The Court will not leave this point without issuing a warning to the counsel of appellants.&nbsp; Going over the cases cited in their Brief, the Court noted that she had incorrectly presented these.&nbsp; For instance, on page 7 thereof, she alleges that in <i>People v. Ramos,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> "the Supreme Court [had the] occasion to state that criminal conspiracy must always be founded on facts, not on mere inferences, conjectures and presumptions.&nbsp; It must be proven like any other crime accusation, that is, independently and beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup> But a review of the said case, shows absolutely no mention of criminal conspiracy.&nbsp; How can there be any when the accused therein was charged with committing the crime of kidnapping all by his lonesome self?<br><br>Moreover, also on page 7 of appellants' Brief, counsel made it appear that in <i>People v. Carpo,</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> "the Supreme Court held [that] mere presence, even with approval but without active participation of the accused[,] is not enough for purposes of conviction.&nbsp; Thus, it was held, the acts of [accused-appellant] in allowing the three unidentified men to board the tricycle despite the [victim's] payment for the unoccupied seats and in deviating from the usual route, which were the basis for his conviction -- are not sufficient evidence to prove or to suggest a concerted action, much less unity of purpose in perpetuating the slay of the victim.&nbsp; While it may elicit suspicion on the [accused-appellants'] actuations, there is no evidence to prove the existence of criminal conspiracy.&nbsp; Conspiracy to be a basis for conviction should be proved as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the crime itself, for conspiracy is not the product of negligence but of intention on the part of the cohorts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Again, we reviewed the cited case in its entirety, but we did not find any of the facts and ruling that counsel had quoted.

Lourdes Felipe was made even weaker by her good friend Marifel Dulo.&nbsp; Since what she was wearing was bloodied, the former allegedly went to the latter's house around midnight of November 20, 1994, to borrow a t-shirt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> When Marifel asked what had happened, appellant answered, "[N]akapatay kami."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Upon further inquiry, the latter revealed that she was with "Boy her brother and her nephew named Eduardo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On direct examination by Atty. Rodolfo P. Liwanag -- appellants' former counsel -- Ma. Lourdes Felipe positively testified on the events of November 20, 1994. According to her, she went to the house of Marifel to change her bloodstained t-shirt with a clean one lent by the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Atty. Liwanag repeatedly asked this question to make sure appellant knew what question she was answering, but she persisted. She, however, completely changed her testimony when examined by their new counsel, Atty. Bernardina R. Ariñas. Appellant testified that she had never changed any bloodied t-shirt, much less gone to the house of Marifel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [46]</sup> This inconsistency in the statements of the former works against her, as it shows that her defenses of denial and alibi were mere afterthoughts concocted to exonerate her from criminal liability.<br><br>As to Appellant Dionisio Felipe, the trial court characterized his alibi as follows:<br><blockquote> "Accused Dionisio Felipe, on the other hand, in his vain attempt to escape and exculpate himself[,] proceeded towards Brgy. Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga where he was caught by the barangay tanods led by Brgy. Captain Nestor Sanggalang of Lourdes, Candaba, Pampanga while walking along the said place[.&nbsp; He] admitted later[,] when confronted by the barangay tanods[,] that he was involved in a killing incident." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, Barangay Captain Sanggalang positively testified during direct and cross-examinations that the said appellant had told him, "<i>[S]abit ako sa pagpatay</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [48]</sup>&nbsp; We see absolutely no reason why the barangay captain would fabricate this part of his testimony.&nbsp; He did not stand to gain anything by making up statements allegedly relayed to him by appellant. What this fact demonstrates is that the prosecution presented witnesses whose positive testimonies about the events -- prior to, during and immediately after the killing -- were rebutted by appellants with bare denials and negative statements.&nbsp; As a rule, greater weight is accorded to the positive narration of prosecution witnesses than to the negative testimonies of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>, to rebut the prosecution's allegation of conspiracy, appellants rely on the testimony of Marisa Velasquez that Eduardo Felipe admitted having killed the victim all by himself.&nbsp; Velasquez testified in the following manner:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"Atty.
