				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On 18 April 1992, private respondent Efren E. Bartolome entered into a Contract to Sell with petitioners, the spouses Hendrik and Alice Biesterbos, in which Bartolome agreed to sell to the spouses Biesterbos one (1) unit of a duplex residential house and lot with an area of three hundred forty-five (345) square meters, more or less, situated at Crestwood Court Subdivision, Bakakeng Norte, Baguio City, for Two Million (P2,000,000.00) Pesos.&nbsp; The property was, at the time of the agreement, mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank (PNB).&nbsp; The contract to sell provided, among other stipulations, that -<br><blockquote> "1.

In a letter, dated 20 December 1992, allegedly addressed to the Baguio residence of petitioners, respondent demanded the payment of the still unpaid balance of P710,713.16.&nbsp; On 24 March 1993, respondent claimed to have sent another letter to petitioners with the summary of the amounts due and payable, totaling P718,407.92, inclusive of -<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="35%">"Bank's Interest and Bank charges<br> From 01 August to 13 October 1992</td> <td valign="bottom" width="8%">-</td> <td valign="bottom" width="57%">&nbsp;

Except for this letter of 18 May 1993, petitioners denied having received any other demand-letter from respondent.<br><br>In a letter of 03 July 1993, petitioners, through counsel, informed respondent that they had deposited the amount of P521,691.76, "In Trust For Mr. Efren Bartolome," at the PNB branch in Baguio City, and that the money could be withdrawn by him at anytime during banking hours.&nbsp; Apparently not satisfied with the arrangement made with the bank, respondent, on 09 July 1993, filed a complaint for specific performance and damages against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, specifically praying thusly:<br><blockquote> "WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed of the Honorable Court, after due notice and hearing to render judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, ordering the defendants jointly and severally to:<br><br>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Petitioners also asserted that Alicia Biesterbos had paid respondent the following amounts even after the agreed period of 30 July 1992, to wit:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">"1) </td> <td width="40%">17 April 1992 </td> <td width="5%">– </td> <td width="50%">P&nbsp;

Petitioners prayed that the consignation of the amount of P521,691.76, representing what they averred to be the amount due from them under the contract to sell, be meanwhile approved by the trial court and respondent be made to transfer to them the absolute ownership of the property.<br><br>On 21 July 1994, the trial court issued an order denying the prayer for consignation for lack of merit. In time, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 7, of Baguio City finally rendered its decision, it adjudged:<br><blockquote> "WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>"(a) Declaring defendants Biesterbos to have complied with their obligation under the contract to sell with respect to the townhouse and lot;<br><br>"(b) Ordering plaintiff Bartolome to execute the corresponding deed of sale transferring the townhouse and lot to the defendants Biesterbos;<br><br>"(c) Ordering the plaintiff Bartolome to deliver the Transfer Certificate of Title to the defendants-buyers Biesterbos free from all liens and encumbrances as committed by him in the contract to sell;<br><br>"(d) Ordering the defendants Biesterbos to reimburse to the plaintiff P518,791.60 representing the balance of the P600,000.00 which the latter had advanced to the owner of the adjacent lot;<br><br>"(e) Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiff P2,900.00 which represents the cost of the transfer of the other adjacent lot, which amount is admitted in the defendants' pleading (answer);<br><br>"(f) Denying the claim of the defendants for the refund of P300,000.00 alleged overpayment for lack of merit;<br><br>"(g) Denying the claims for damages by both parties for lack of merit;<br><br>"(h) Costs of the suit to be shared by the contending parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Still feeling aggrieved, respondent appealed the case to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; On 22 February 2000, the appellate court rendered a decision affirming that of the trial court except insofar as the latter had ordered the payment of interest on "P518,791.76 representing the balance of the P600,000.00 which the latter (Bartolome) had advanced for petitioners as payment to the owner of the adjacent lot, with an interest of 12% per annum from the time the defendants-appellees defaulted in their payment up to the time of the filing of the complaint being in the nature of a contract of loan."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In its resolution of 21 December 2001, the Court of Appeals granted the motion for reconsideration of respondent and ordered that the interest of 12% <i>per annum</i> awarded to him should be paid from the time of default until full payment of the principal.<br><br>Petitioners, in their petition for review before this Court, would now question the interest payment decreed by the Court of Appeals, contending that –<br><blockquote> "(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion and error in law, as it violated the provisions of Art. 2209 of the New Civil Code, when it ordered herein petitioners to pay `12% interest per annum' of the amount of P518,791.76, when no such or any interest was agreed upon by the parties; and<br><br>"(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion and error in law when it ruled that the running of the period to pay such 12% interest per annum is from the time of `default until full payment of the principal' despite the fact that there was a valid tender of payment made by the petitioners even before the filing of the complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>The trial court and the appellate court correctly concluded that the agreement between the parties insofar as it had obligated (a) respondent to "advance for the buyer (petitioners) the cost of the adjacent vacant lot belonging to his (respondent's) brother at an agreed price of Six Hundred Thousand (P600,000.00) Pesos," and (b) petitioners to, in turn, reimburse to respondent the "Six Hundred Thousand Pesos, including the cost of transfer, documentation and registration fee, within a reasonable time or on/or before July 30, 1992, after ownership of the lot is transferred to petitioners,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> was in the nature of a contract of loan or a forbearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> While the trial court and the appellate court did not make any categorical statement as to when an initial demand was made by respondent, the parties, however, agreed at the pre-trial conference in the trial court to stipulate on the authenticity of the demand-letter of 18 May 1993 sent to petitioners by Atty. George Florendo (respondent's counsel). The Court would here then consider such date, absent any contrary showing, as the demand to occasion default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In their letter of 03 July 1993, likewise included among the stipulation of facts of the parties during the pre-trial conference, petitioners, through counsel, informed respondent that the former had deposited the amount of P521,691.76 "In Trust For Mr. Efren Bartolome" at the PNB, Session Road, Baguio City, which sum could be withdrawn by respondent at anytime during banking hours.&nbsp; While such a procedure did not strictly constitute a valid tender of payment and consignation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> still, it could be considered an act of good faith on the part of petitioners to fully settle their obligation. Equity and justice would demand that such an act, placing at the disposal of respondent the deposited sum, should have the effect of suspending the running of the interest on said outstanding amount.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Gregorio Araneta, Inc. vs. De Paterno and Vidal</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> this Court said:<br><blockquote> "The matter of the suspension of the running of interest on the loan is governed by principles which regard reality rather than technicality, substance rather than form.&nbsp; Good faith of the offeror or ability to make good the offer should in simple justice excuse the debtor from paying interest after the offer was rejected. A debtor cannot be considered delinquent who offered checks backed by sufficient deposit or ready to pay cash if the creditor chose that means of payment.&nbsp; Technical defects of the offer cannot be adduced to destroy its effects when the objection to accept the payment was based on entirely different grounds.&nbsp; Thus, although the defective consignation made by the debtor did not discharge the mortgage debt, the running of interest on the loan is suspended by the offer and tender of payment."<br></blockquote>With regard the payment of interest, the ruling of this Court in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> should be worthwhile reiterating for guidance. Thus -<br><blockquote> "I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an obligation, regardless of its source, <i>i.e.</i>, law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on `Damages' of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.<br><br>"II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:<br><br>"1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, <i>i.e.</i>, a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing.&nbsp; Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded.&nbsp; In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, <i>i.e.</i>, from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.<br><br>"2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum.&nbsp; No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).&nbsp; The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br>"3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is partly GRANTED.&nbsp; The questioned decision and resolution of the appellate court are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, <i>i.e.,</i> that the legal interest to be paid on the principal amount of P518,791.76 is TWELVE PERCENT (12%) <i>per annum</i> which shall commence from 18 May 1993 when extrajudicial demand was made on petitioners up until 03 July 1993 when petitioners notified respondent that the amount of P521,691.76 had been deposited in his name with the Philippine National Bank withdrawable by him at any time during banking hours.&nbsp;
