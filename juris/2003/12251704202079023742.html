and (2) whether the items enumerated in appellant's Motion for Return of Personal Documents, Vehicle and Paraphernalia, which items are allegedly not among those particularly described in Search Warrant No. 99-0038, should be returned to him.&nbsp; These issues shall be resolved in <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br><u>Illegal Possession of 204 Grams of <i>Shabu</i></u><br><br>As appellant questions the legality of the search of his residence, the actions of the police officers, as agents of the State, must be carefully considered in light of appellant's right against unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed by Sections 2 and 3, Article III of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>What constitutes a reasonable or unreasonable search or seizure is a purely judicial question determinable from a consideration of the attendant circumstances including the purpose of the search, the presence or absence of probable cause, the manner in which the search and seizure was made, the place or thing searched, and the character of the articles procured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Since no presumption of regularity may be invoked by an officer to justify an encroachment of rights secured by the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> courts must cautiously weigh the evidence before them. As early as in the 1937 case of <i>People v. Veloso</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote> <b>A search warrant must conform strictly to the requirements of the constitutional and statutory provisions under which it is issued.&nbsp; Otherwise, it is void</b>.&nbsp; The proceedings upon search warrants, it has rightly been held, must be absolutely legal, "for there is not a description of process known to law, the execution of which is more distressing to the citizen.&nbsp; Perhaps there is none which excites such intense feeling in consequence of its humiliating and degrading effect." <b>The warrant will always be construed strictly without, however, going the full length of requiring technical accuracy.&nbsp; No presumptions of regularity are to be invoked in aid of the process when an officer undertakes to justify under it</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Indeed, a strict interpretation of the constitutional, statutory and procedural rules authorizing search and seizure is required, and strict compliance therewith is demanded because:<br><blockquote> x x x Of all the rights of a citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves the exemption of his private affairs, books, and papers from the inspection and scrutiny of others.&nbsp; While the power to search and seize is necessary to the public welfare, still it must be exercised and the law enforced without transgressing the constitutional rights of citizens, for the enforcement of no statute is of sufficient importance to justify indifference to the basic principles of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote>In arriving at the appealed decision, the trial court placed greater weight on the testimony of the police officers to whom it accorded the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote> Coming to the first issue raised, <b>the Court gives credence to the testimonies of the police officers and accords them the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duty. The Court has observed the demeanor of the witnesses and finds the prosecution witnesses more credible than the defense witnesses.&nbsp; </b>x x x<br><br>On the other hand, <b>there is no showing that the police officers had ill motive when they applied for and secured the Search Warrant, raided the house of the accused and arrested him</b>. Accused is a Chinese national who appeared to have no quarrel with the arresting police officers and thus the police officers had no reason to fabricate or trump up charges against him. <b>Hence, there appears to be no reason the police officers should not be accorded the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duty.</b>&nbsp; As held by the Supreme Court, "(L)aw enforcers are presumed to have regularly performed their official duty, in the absence of the evidence to the contrary. x x x We see no valid obstacle to the application of the ruling in People vs. Capulong, (160 SCRA 533 {1988}) that <b>credence is accorded to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who are law enforcers for it is presumed that they have regularly performed their duty in the absence of convincing proof to the contrary</b>.

(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As pointed out earlier, the members of the raiding team categorically admitted that the search of the upper floor, which allegedly resulted in the recovery of the plastic bag containing the <i>shabu</i>, did not take place in the presence of either the lawful occupant of the premises, <i>i.e.</i> appellant (who was out), or his son Jack Go (who was handcuffed to a chair on the ground floor).&nbsp; Such a procedure, whereby the witnesses prescribed by law are prevented from actually observing and monitoring the search of the premises, violates both the spirit and letter of the law:<br><blockquote> Furthermore, the claim of the accused-appellant that the marijuana was planted is strengthened by the manner in which the search was conducted by the police authorities.&nbsp; <b>The accused-appellant was seated at the sala together with Sgt. Yte when they heard someone in the kitchen uttered "ito na".&nbsp; </b>Apparently, the search of the accused-appellant's house was conducted in violation of Section 7, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court which specifically provides that <b>no search of a house, room or any other premise shall be made except in the presence of the lawful occupant thereof or any member of his family or in the absence of the latter, in the presence of two (2) witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality.&nbsp; <u>This requirement is mandatory to ensure regularity in the execution of the search warrant</u>.</b> Violation of said rule is in fact punishable under Article 130 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>As we have ruled in <i>Eduardo Quintero</i> <i>vs.</i> <i>The National Bureau of Investigation, et al<b>. </b></i><b>a procedure, wherein members of a raiding party can roam around the raided premises unaccompanied by any witness, as the only witnesses available as prescribed by law are made to witness a search conducted by the other members of the raiding party in another part of the house, is violative of both the spirit and letter of the law</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>That the raiding party summoned two <i>barangay kagawads</i> to witness the search at the second floor is of no moment.&nbsp; The Rules of Court clearly and explicitly establishes a hierarchy among the witnesses in whose presence the search of the premises must be conducted. Thus, Section 8, Rule 126 provides that the search should be witnessed by "two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality" <u>only in the absence</u> of either the lawful occupant of the premises or any member of his family. Thus, the search of appellant's residence clearly should have been witnessed by his son Jack Go who was present at the time. The police officers were without discretion to substitute their choice of witnesses for those prescribed by the law.<br><br>The claim of SPO1 Fernandez and PO2 Abulencia that Jack Go voluntarily waived his right to witness the search, allegedly because there would be no one left in the sala and anyway <i>barangay</i> officials were present, cannot be accepted. To be valid, a waiver must be made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Furthermore, the presumption is always against the waiver of a constitutionally protected right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>While Jack Go was present from the time the raiding team entered the premises until after the search was completed, he was, however, handcuffed to a chair in the sala. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> All alone and confronted by five police officers who had deprived him of his liberty, he cannot thus be considered to have "voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently" waived his right to witness the search of the house. "Consent" given under such intimidating, coercive circumstances is no consent within the purview of the constitutional guaranty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>The search conducted by the police officers of appellant's residence is essentially no different from that in <i>People v.

Although they fetched two persons to witness the search, the witnesses were called in only after the policemen had already entered accused-appellant's residence</b> (pp. 22-23, tsn, December 11, 1991), <b>and, therefore, the policemen had more than ample time to plant the shabu</b>.&nbsp; Corollary to the Constitutional precept that, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved (Sec. 14 (2), Article III, <i>Constitution</i> of the Republic of the Philippines) is the rule that in order to convict an accused the circumstances of the case must exclude all and each and every hypothesis consistent with his innocence (<i>People vs. Tanchoco</i>, 76 Phil. 463 [1946]; <i>People vs. Constante</i>, 12 SCRA 653 [1964]; <i>People vs. Jara</i>, 144 SCRA 516 [1986]).&nbsp; The facts of the case do not rule out the hypothesis that accused-appellant is innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The raiding team's departure from the procedure mandated by Section 8, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court, taken together with the numerous other irregularities attending the search of appellant's residence, tainted the search with the vice of unreasonableness, thus compelling this Court to apply the exclusionary rule and declare the seized articles inadmissible in evidence.&nbsp; This must necessarily be so since it is this Court's solemn duty to be ever watchful for the constitutional rights of the people, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> In the oft-quoted language of Judge Learned Hand:<br><blockquote> As we understand it, the reason for the exclusion of evidence competent as such, which has been unlawfully acquired, is that <b>exclusion is the only practical way of enforcing the constitutional privilege</b>.

"<b>The evident purpose and intent of the requirement is to limit the things to be seized to those, and only those, particularly described in the search warrant – to leave the officers of the law with no discretion regarding what articles they should seize</b>, to the end that unreasonable searches and seizures may not be made and that abuses may not be committed" (Corro v.

It bears reiterating that the purpose of the constitutional requirement that the articles to be seized be particularly described in the warrant is to limit the things to be seized to those, and only those, particularly described in the search warrant – <u>to leave the officers of the law with no discretion regarding what articles they should seize</u>. A search warrant is not a sweeping authority empowering a raiding party to undertake a fishing expedition to seize and confiscate any and all kinds of evidence or articles relating to a crime. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>At the same time, the raiding team characterized the seizure of the assorted documents, passports, bankbooks, checks, check writer, typewriter, dry seals and stamp pads as "seizure of evidence in plain view." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>Under the plain view doctrine, objects falling in the "plain view" of an officer who has a right to be in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be presented as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> This Court had the opportunity to summarize the rules governing plain view searches in the recent case of <i>People v. Doria</i>, <i>supra</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote> The "plain view" doctrine applies when the following requisites concur: (a) the law enforcement officer in search of the evidence has a prior justification for an intrusion or is in a position from which he can view a particular area; (b) the discovery of the evidence in plain view is inadvertent; (c) <u>it is immediately apparent to the officer that the item he observes may be evidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure</u>. The law enforcement officer must lawfully make an initial intrusion or properly be in a position from which he can particularly view the area. In the course of such lawful intrusion, he came inadvertently across a piece of evidence incriminating the accused. The object must be open to eye and hand and its discovery inadvertent. (Underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup></blockquote>Measured against the foregoing standards, it is readily apparent that the seizure of the passports, bankbooks, checks, typewriter, check writer, dry seals and stamp pads and other assorted documents does not fall within the "plain view" exception. The assertions of the police officers that said objects were "inadvertently" seized within their "plain view" are mere legal conclusions which are not supported by any clear narration of the factual circumstances leading to their discovery.
