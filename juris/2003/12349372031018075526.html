				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Cabanatuan City, Branch 27, in Criminal Case No. 7966-AF, convicting appellant Joselito dela Cruz y Damaso of murder, sentencing him to suffer the death penalty and directing him to pay the heirs of the victim Romeo B. Domingo indemnity in the amount of P50,000 and actual damages in the amount of P56,607.<br><br>On December 22, 1997, an Information charging the appellant with murder was filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, docketed as Criminal Case No. 7966-AF, which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 19<sup>th</sup> day of December 1997, in the City of Cabanatuan, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill and with treachery, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence upon the person of one <b>ROMEO B.

Romeo called the appellant <i>Pareng </i>Lito. The latter had been to Romeo's house at Barangay Bakodbayan, Cabanatuan City many times. The appellant worked in a mango farm owned by Jun Reyes, located about five hundred meters away from Romeo's house. Rommel Domingo, Romeo's ten-year-old son, was also acquainted with the appellant as the latter and his father had frequent drinking sprees in their house. Rommel called the appellant <i>Kuya </i>Lito.<br><br>At around 3:00 p.m. of December 19, 1997, Romeo arrived home, quite inebriated. He told his wife Leonora that he and <i>Pareng </i>Lito had a drinking spree. He then slept and had dinner at 5:30 p.m. He went to the sala and watched television. At about 6:30 p.m., Leonora, Rommel and his sister had dinner. Afterwards, Rommel joined his father who was watching the television program <i>Mula sa Puso</i>, while Leonora supervised her daughter in washing dishes in the kitchen. Rommel was seated at the third step of the stairs from the sala to the upper portion of their house, which was about half a meter away from his father. A 40-watt bulb illuminated the sala. The door of the house was open.<br><br>Rommel was startled when he heard a gunshot. He turned his head sideways and saw the appellant, armed with a handgun, about half a meter away from his father. Rommel was shocked to see his father fall to the floor, mortally wounded. The appellant then ran from the house through the door. Rommel rushed to his father's side. Romeo told his son to take care of his mother, and that he was shot by <i>Pareng </i>Lito. Rommel ran after the appellant. As he was scrambling to escape, the appellant stumbled and fell. Rommel had a full view of the appellant before the latter stood up and fled from the scene. In the meantime, Leonora rushed to the sala when she heard the gunshot. She saw Rommel sprawled on the floor, bloodied all over. She embraced her husband, who told her that he was shot by his <i>Pareng </i>Lito.<br><br>Barangay Tanod Jose Mateo was on patrol when he heard the gunshot. He rushed towards the direction of the gunfire, which led him to the house of Romeo. Jose saw the owner of the house sprawled in the sala, already dead. He learned from Rommel, who by then had returned to the house, that it was the appellant who had shot his father. The barangay tanods, including the barangay captain, arrested the appellant. He was brought to the barangay hall and was later turned over to the police sub-station. The barangay tanods asked permission from the overseer of the Reyes mango farm to conduct a search of the place in connection with the shooting. Barangay Tanod Remigio Agustin found a bag in a small canal in the farm, which contained a homemade shotgun<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> with an empty shell. The gun had no serial number, and its bolt could not be pulled.<br><br>Rommel gave a sworn statement to SPO1 Marcelino V. Veneracion at 11:30 p.m. of December 19, 1997 where he identified the appellant as the assailant of his father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On the same day, Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Jun B. Concepcion performed an autopsy on Romeo's body and prepared an autopsy report, showing <i>inter alia</i> that the victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds and that five slugs were extracted from his body:<br><br><center><b>F I N D I N G S ( P E R T I N E N T O N L Y ):</b></center><blockquote>Ht: 165cm in legth ([<i>sic</i>].<br><br>(+) Gunshot wounds, multiple, on the (L) supra-scapular area, as point of entry, (7), 5-6 inches away from mid-cervical vertebrae, 3-3cm in dia. with trajectory towards the (R) Ant. chest area, 1-slug through - through the rest non-through-through.<br><br><b>INTERNALLY</b>: (+) Gunshot wounds, multiple, penetrating the (L) lung (apex &amp; middle lobe).<br><br>(+) Gunshot wounds, multiple, penetrating the (R) lung<br><br>middle &amp; basal).

He testified that Romeo was his friend and that he had no motive for killing the latter. On December 19, 1997, he and Romeo had a drinking spree at the Reyes farm from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. He was already drunk at about 6:20 p.m., and fell asleep in his house at Purok 1, Pantoc, Bakodbayan, Cabanatuan City, about five hundred meters away from Romeo's house. He was awakened when the members of the Bantay Bayan arrived to fetch him. He was told that they were ordered to bring him to Barangay Captain Nono Concepcion. The appellant was later arrested by policemen and brought back to his house. Members of the Bantay Bayan thereafter searched his yard for the gun used to kill Romeo, but no weapon was found. The appellant pointed out that aside from him, Romeo had other friends whose first names were Lito: Lito Manuel, Lito Edubane, Lito Sado, and Lito del Rosario, with whom he and Romeo used to have drinking sprees. Any one of them could have killed Romeo.<br><br>After due proceedings, the trial court rendered judgment acquitting the appellant for violation of Republic Act No. 8294 in Criminal Case No. 7967-AF and convicting him of murder in Criminal Case No. 7966-AF, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, and in the absence of any mitigating circumstance and in the presence of the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, the Court finds and so holds the accused <b>JOSELITO DELA CRUZ y DAMASO</b> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <b>MURDER</b> and sentences him to suffer the penalty of <u><b>DEATH</b></u> in Criminal Case No. 7966(AF), and for him to indemnify the heirs of the deceased offended party in the sum of P50,000.00, and the amount of P56,607.00, representing actual damages.<br><br>No moral damages are awarded as the same is subsumed in the civil indemnity for death <i>(People vs. R. Daen, G.R. No. 112015, 26 May 1995).</i><br><br>To pay the costs of the suit.<br><br>In criminal Case No. 7967-AF, <i>for Violation of Sec. 1, Pars. 1 &amp; 3 of Republic Act 8294 (Aggravated Illegal Possession of Firearm)</i>, for insufficiency of evidence, the Court hereby orders the <b>ACQUITTAL</b> of the accused, without costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>On automatic appeal in Criminal Case No. 7966-AF, the appellant assails the decision of the trial court, contending that:<br><br><center>I</center><blockquote>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF ROMMEL DOMINGO.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT TO THE ALLEGED DYING DECLARATION OF THE DECEASED ROMEO DOMINGO.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN FINDING THAT TREACHERY ATTENDED THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE CRIME CHARGED HAS BEEN PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>The appellant avers that Rommel could not have seen him shoot and kill the victim because the boy was inside the room upstairs, while the victim was in the sala watching television. It took Rommel about two minutes to rush down from the room upstairs to the sala where his father was lying prostrate on the floor. By then, the assailant had already gone out of the house and fled to the open fields. For its part, the trial court gave credence and full probative weight to Rommel's testimony that he was only half a meter away from his father when the shooting took place, and that he saw the appellant outside the house immediately after the shooting and even pursued the latter:<br><blockquote>Rommel Domingo had known the accused for quite sometime as he had frequented their place in drinking sessions with his late father. As a matter of fact, the accused himself had admitted that he had frequented the victim's store in search of drinking companionship [<i>sic</i>] and idle banter. Addedly, there was sufficient lighting inside and outside the victim's residence. Inside the house hang a 40-watt electric bulb and the lit TV set provided adequate lighting that helped the son identify his father's attacker. Furthermore, the son pursued immediately the accused after he fired the fatal shot at the decedent. Outside, there was another electric bulb providing illumination that helped the son identify the accused who stumbled to the ground and whose side view of his face was viewed - for the second time - by the young witness.<br><br>Rommel Domingo is a credible witness for, aside from his youth and yet untarnished perception of truth, he had no ill-motive to ascribe something evil to the accused unless he, truly, was the author thereof.<br><br>The testimonies of witnesses Rommel Domingo and Leonora are credible as they are impressed with truth and logic aside from the fact that they have no ill-motive to so give such damning testimony against herein accused were it not, indeed, the truth. Even the accused had admitted that he could not see any ill-motive on the part of the victim's son for his testimony derogatory to him.<br><blockquote>"<i>When there is no evidence indicating that the principal witness for the prosecution was moved by any improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so moved, and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit </i>(People vs. Tidong, 225 SCRA 324.)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>The appellant's contention does not persuade. The legal aphorism is that the findings of facts of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of witnesses, its assessment of their credibility and the probative weight of their testimonies, as well as its conclusions anchored on the said findings, are accorded by the appellate court high respect if not conclusive effect, unless the trial court ignored, misunderstood and misconstrued facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would warrant a reversal of the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>This Court finds no basis for deviating from the findings and conclusions of the trial court. The records show that an ocular inspection of the <i> situs criminis</i> was conducted in the presence of the appellant, his counsel and the public prosecutor, during which Rommel testified on his location relative to where his father was seated while they were watching television, before and after the latter was shot. Rommel testified that he was merely half a meter away from his father and saw the appellant immediately after the gunfire.

Rommel even called the appellant <i>Kuya </i>Lito. Considering Rommel's proximity to the victim and the appellant and the lighting condition in the sala at the time of the shooting, there can be no doubt that Rommel saw his father's assailant. Moreover, when Rommel ran after the appellant, the latter fell to the ground as he fled towards the direction of the open field. It was at this instant when Rommel saw the appellant's face:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q</td><td width="90%">Now, you stated a while ago, you were able to see Joselito dela Cruz running away is that correct?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td><div align="justify">Will you please tell to this Honorable Court, the exact position of Joselito dela Cruz when he was running away from the scene of the crime?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">Fiscal:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td>Objection, Your Honor, the witness is not in a position, how can ...</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">COURT:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td>Question, at the first time you saw Joselito dela Cruz running, did you see his face?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>Yes, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>Why, was he facing you or his face on the sidewise?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>On his sidewise, sir.

Considering the short distance between the two houses, it was not impossible for the appellant to be at the scene of the crime.<br><br><center><b>The Crime Committed by the Appellant</b></center><br>The trial court held that the appellant is guilty of murder qualified by treachery. The appellant asserts that the prosecution failed to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery because there is no evidence of the particulars that transpired before the victim was shot. The bare fact that the victim was shot at the back does not prove treachery. For its part, the trial court held that the killing was qualified by treachery because the victim was shot unexpectedly and so suddenly, without the slightest provocation on the part of the latter.<br><br>We agree with the trial court. The victim was watching television with his back towards the door of the house. Because the door was open, the appellant was able to noiselessly approach the victim from behind and fire the gun. The victim was unarmed. He did not expect the appellant to stealthily intrude into his house and shoot him at close range. Patently, the killing was qualified by treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Proper Penalty</b></center><br>The penalty for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is <i> reclusion perpetua</i> to death.

The decision of the trial court must, accordingly, be modified.<br><br>In addition to civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>, the heirs of the victim Romeo Domingo are entitled to moral damages in the amount of P50,000.
