				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari and prohibition with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order, under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking the nullification of the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 18, 2002 of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) <i>en banc.</i> Petitioner primarily contends that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in ordering the exclusion from canvass of the election returns from nine precincts in the Municipality of Kabuntalan, Province of Maguindanao, in connection with the May 14, 2001 elections.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i>The Antecedents</i><br></div><br>During the May 14, 2001 elections, Bai Susan&nbsp; A. Samad ("Samad"), Salipongan I. Dagloc ("Dagloc") and Kennedy Dilangalen ("Dilangalen") were among the mayoralty candidates in the Municipality of Kabuntalan, Province of Maguindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>During the canvassing of the election returns for the Municipality of Kabuntalan, Samad, Dagloc and Dilangalen filed their respective objections and oppositions to the inclusion or exclusion from the canvass of certain election returns from several precincts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Samad contested the inclusion of the election returns from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A and 33B, all of Brgy. Bagumbayan, on the grounds that: (a) the returns were tampered and falsified, and (b) the returns were prepared under duress, threats, coercion and intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In its rulings dated May 23 and May 26, 2001, the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Kabuntalan ("the Board") dismissed Samad's petitions to exclude the said election returns because she failed to submit evidence within twenty-four (24) hours from the time of her objection.&nbsp; On June 1 and 5, 2001,&nbsp; Samad appealed from said rulings of the Board before the COMELEC,&nbsp; and her appeal was docketed as&nbsp; SPC 01-341 and SPC 01-342, respectively. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Dagloc questioned the inclusion of the election returns from Precinct Nos. 78A/79A, 80A/81A and 82A on the ground that the returns were manufactured or spurious because the counting of the votes and the preparation of the said election returns were conducted in a privately-owned house which was under the control of a barangay chairman, who was an alleged ally and political supporter of Samad.&nbsp; Dagloc also opposed the exclusion of&nbsp; the election returns from Precinct Nos. 58A/59A, 70A, 71A, 83A and 84A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on the ground that&nbsp; said returns appeared regular on their face and the alleged irregularities were done during the voting. Dagloc further stated that the COMELEC authorized the voting in Precinct Nos. 78A/79A, 80A/81A, 82A, 58A/59A, 70A, 71A, 83A and 84A to be conducted in the gymnasium of the 6<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division, Philippine Army, Awang, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Board, in resolving the objections and oppositions filed by Dagloc, ruled to include in the canvassing the election returns from Precinct Nos. 78A/79A, 80A/81A and 82A, and granted Samad's petitions to exclude the returns from Precinct Nos. 58A/59A, 70A, 71A, 83A and 84A. On June 7, 2001, Dagloc appealed from the said rulings of the Board with the COMELEC, and his appeal was docketed as SPC 01-282.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Dilangalen also filed several petitions to exclude from the canvassing the election returns from Precinct Nos. 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B/3B, 3A, 5A/6A, 17A, 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A/33B, 34A/35A, 36A/37A, 38A, 45B/46A, 70A, 71A, 78A/79B, 80A/81A and 82A based on any of the following grounds:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(a)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The returns were prepared under duress, threats and intimidation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The returns were manufactured and falsified and they contained erasures, mistakes, manifest errors and superimpositions in figures and in words;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The election returns lacked material data;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(d)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Terrorism and election irregularities transpired during the casting of votes; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(e)</td> <td> <div align="justify">Statistical improbability of the results of the elections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Dilangalen alleged that the Board dismissed his petitions and included the contested returns in the canvassing.&nbsp; Hence, on June 12, 2001, he filed a pre-proclamation case before the COMELEC, docketed as SPC No. 01-285.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On June 13, 2001, Dagloc filed a Petition to Annul Falsified Proclamation and to Suspend the Effects of Falsified Proclamation, docketed as SPC 01-291.&nbsp; Dagloc alleged that on June 7, 2001, while the tabulation of the election returns was still in progress, the Board, consisting of Chairman Dionisio Linaban and Member-Secretary Andaman&nbsp; Samud proclaimed&nbsp; Bai Susan A. Samad as mayor, Datu Nasser H. Ali as vice-mayor, and Monambai (sic) Diocalano, Brahim Mokamad, H. Sittie Tula, Lincoln Radzak, Zainadun Kabulan, H. Faisal Pendi, Almada Pidzakal and H.

Dagloc thus prayed for the annulment of the proclamation of&nbsp; Samad, <i>et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On June 18, 2001, Samad, <i>et al</i>. filed a petition before the COMELEC, docketed as SPC 01-310, alleging that on June 8, 2001, members of the Board, namely, Vice-Chairman Usman D. Zailon and Member-Secretary Andaman K. Samud proclaimed Datu Salipongan L. Dagloc as mayor, Datu Mohidin S. Lauban as vice-mayor, and Amnambai Diocolano, H. Sittie Tula, Fhamie Dumaba, H. Brahim Mokamad and Lincoln M. Radzak as members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> ("Dagloc, <i>et al</i>.").&nbsp; Said proclamation was evidenced by CEF No. 25 with Serial No. 8692109.&nbsp; Samad, <i>et al</i>. contended that the second proclamation was a nullity based on the following grounds:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(a)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The second proclamation was made without notice and hearing;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(b)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The second proclamation cannot annul the first proclamation;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(c)</td> <td> <div align="justify">The signature of Andamen K.

The Second Division, however, stated that objections to the inclusion of the election returns should not be immediately accorded weight absent any showing that on the face thereof, there are patent irregularities.&nbsp; It took into consideration the doctrine that as long as the returns appear to be authentic and duly accomplished on their face, the Board of Canvassers cannot look beyond or behind them to verify allegations of irregularities in the casting or counting of votes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Second Division noted that based on the written rulings of the Linaban Board, the election returns from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B and 33A/33B and 45A (should have been Precinct Nos. 70A, 71A, 83A and 84A) were excluded because of alleged election irregularities perpetrated by some members of the Board of Election Inspectors ("BEI") and the disqualification of some members thereof as evidenced by purported affidavits executed by Usman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Second Division, however, resolved to include the returns from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B and 33A/33B (should have been Precinct Nos. 70A, 71A, 83A and 84A) in the canvass on the following grounds:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">a)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">The contested election returns contained no sign of any tampering or alteration, affecting the standing of the candidates; they are <i>prima facie</i> regular on their face;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>b) </td> <td><div align="justify">The alleged irregularities occurred in the BEI level.

To reiterate, in said case, the Court stated that under the Omnibus Election Code, pre-proclamation controversies are limited to: (1) challenges directed<b> </b>against the<b><i> composition or proceedings of the board of canvassers (not the board of election inspectors</i></b>), or (2) challenges related to <b><i>election returns</i></b> to which a party must have made specific objections.&nbsp; The private respondent therein objected to two returns on the ground "that the election returns are manufactured, fabricated or not authentic, considering that <i>the election returns includes votes on ballots which are spurious, marked and invalid ballots</i>." In said case, the Court held that the municipal board of canvassers correctly ruled that private respondent's objections were not proper in a proclamation controversy since the objection, as worded, <b><i>did not</i></b> <b><i>challenge the returns</i></b>, but was directed primarily at the ballots reflected in the returns (emphasis supplied). Hence, the Court ruled, "[i]t is settled that issues relative to the appreciation of ballots cannot be raised in a proclamation controversy."&nbsp; "Appreciation of ballots is the task of the board of election inspectors, not the board of canvassers, and questions related thereto are proper only in <i>election protests</i>."<br><br>In this case, what Samad contested was the inclusion of the election returns from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A and 33B on the ground that these were tampered or falsified and were prepared under duress, threats, coercion and intimidation, which are proper issues for a pre-proclamation controversy under paragraphs (b) and (c) of Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code. The Board dismissed Samad's petitions; hence, Samad appealed to the COMELEC. The resolution of the Second Division shows that Samad also sought the exclusion of the election returns from Precinct Nos. 70A, 71A, 83A and 84A, but the ground for her objection does not appear on record. The Board granted the petition of Samad to exclude said returns; hence, Dagloc appealed from the Board's ruling before the COMELEC.&nbsp; Evidently, the pre-proclamation cases filed by Samad fall under the second category adverted to in <b><i>Patoray v. Comelec</i></b>, that is, "(2) challenges related to <b><i>election returns</i></b> to which a party must have made specific objections."<br><br>Moreover, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>'s findings on the nine election returns are anchored on "the manner of their preparation," which it found to be a sham. The COMELEC correctly held that said ground is a pre-proclamation issue, citing Sections 241 and 243 of the Omnibus Election Code, in relation to Section 235 of the same Code, thus:<br><blockquote> Sec. 241. <i>Definition</i>.-- A pre-proclamation controversy refers to any question pertaining to&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; any matter raised under&nbsp;&nbsp; Sections 233, 234, 235 and 236 in relation to the <b><i>preparation</i></b>, transmission, receipt, custody and appreciation of the election returns.<br><br>Sec. 243.&nbsp; <i>Issues that may be raised in pre-proclamation controversy</i>. --&nbsp; The following shall be proper issues that may be raised in a pre-proclamation controversy:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(d) </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When substitute or <b><i>fraudulent returns</i></b> in controverted polling places were canvassed, the results of which materially affected the standing of the aggrieved candidate or candidates.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Sec. 235.&nbsp; <i>When election returns appear to be tampered with or falsified</i>.—If the election returns submitted to the board of canvassers appear to be x x x x prepared by persons other than the member of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers shall use the other copies of said election returns and, if necessary, the copy inside the ballot box which upon previous authority given by the Commission may be retrieved in accordance with Section 220 hereof.&nbsp; If the other copies of the returns are likewise x x x x prepared by persons other than the members of the board of election inspectors, the board of canvassers or any candidate affected shall bring the matter to the attention of the Commission.&nbsp; The Commission shall then, after giving notice to all candidates concerned and after satisfying itself that nothing in the ballot box indicate that its identity and integrity have been violated, order the opening of the ballot box and, likewise after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved shall order the board of election inspectors to recount the votes of the candidates affected and prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of canvassers as basis of the canvass.<br></blockquote>Although the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> noted that Deduzman Lakim, an eyewitness and official watcher in Precinct No. 31A, stated in his affidavit that the ballots in Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A/33B were openly tampered and falsified by Dagloc's supporters, it must be clarified that the appreciation of ballots is not the ground raised by Samad for the exclusion of the nine election returns, and it is also not the basis of the COMELEC e<i>n banc</i> for excluding said returns.<br><br>Further, the aforecited doctrine that "as long as the returns appear to be authentic, and duly accomplished on their face, the Board of Canvassers cannot look beyond or behind them to verify allegations of irregularities in the casting and counting of the votes," is not applicable in this case due to the following reasons:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) The COMELEC has the authority to review the rulings of the Board of Canvassers in a pre-proclamation controversy under paragraphs (e) to (f) of section 20 (Procedure in Disposition of Contested election Returns) of Republic Act No. 7166;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>(2) The COMELEC <i>en banc</i> found that the nine election returns are fraudulent in the manner of their preparation which is a pre-proclamation issue under Sections 241 and 243 of the Omnibus Election Code;<br><br>(3) The allegations of irregularity is not in the casting and counting of votes, but in the preparation of the election returns (i.e., the election returns&nbsp; from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A and 33B were tampered or falsified and were prepared&nbsp; under duress, threats, coercion and intimidation).<br></div><br>Given the factual finding of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> that the nine election returns are spurious in the manner of their preparation, doubt is cast on the authentic appearance of said returns. Hence, the subject election returns cannot be accorded <i>prima facie</i> status as genuine reports of the results of the counts of votes. Nevertheless, under Section 235 of the Omnibus Election Code, a recount of votes may be resorted to, if the integrity of the affected ballot boxes and their contents has been preserved. Thereafter, new returns shall be prepared which shall be used by the Board of Canvassers as basis of the canvass. This procedure protects the will of the electorate.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Second Issue: Sufficiency of evidence in finding that the</i> <br><i>nine election returns were spurious</i><br></div><br>Appellant contends that the COMELEC abused its discretion in finding the nine election returns spurious without clear and convincing evidence of fraud and other election irregularities.<br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>The COMELEC e<i>n banc</i>, after a judicious evaluation of the documents on record, upheld the findings stated in the dissenting opinion of Presiding Commissioner Ralph C.

The Commission shall then, after giving notice to all candidates concerned and after satisfying itself that nothing in the ballot box indicate that its identity and integrity have been violated, order the opening of the ballot box and, likewise after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved shall order the board of election inspectors to recount the votes of the candidates affected and prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of canvassers as basis of the canvass.<br></blockquote>According to petitioner, while it may be true that the board of canvassers will not be compelled to canvass election returns which are falsified or spurious, this does not, however, mean that the board should right away disregard and exclude the election returns and ultimately the votes cast in the precinct. Hence, petitioner contends that the exclusion from canvass of the nine election returns by the COMELEC is a clear exercise of grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The contention is meritorious.<br><br>Outright exclusion of election returns on the ground that they were fraudulently prepared by some members or non-members of the BEI disenfranchises the voters.&nbsp; Hence, when election returns are found to be spurious or falsified, Section 235 of the Omnibus Election Code provides the procedure which enables the COMELEC to ascertain the will of the electorate.<br><br>The COMELEC, therefore, gravely abused its discretion when it excluded outright the subject election returns after finding that they were fraudulent returns.&nbsp; Instead, the COMELEC should have followed the procedure laid down in Section 235 of the Omnibus Election Code: "x x x The Commission shall then, after giving notice to all candidates concerned and after satisfying itself that nothing in the ballot box indicate that its identity and integrity have been violated, order the opening of the ballot box and, likewise after satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly preserved shall order the board of election inspectors to recount the votes of the candidates affected and prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of canvassers as basis of the canvass."<br><br>Nevertheless, if the integrity of the ballots has been violated, the COMELEC need not recount the ballots but should seal the ballot box and order its safekeeping in accordance with Section 237 of the Omnibus Election Code, thus:<br><blockquote> Sec. 237.&nbsp; <i>When integrity of ballots is violated</i>.--&nbsp; If upon the opening of the ballot box as ordered by the Commission under Sections 234, 235 and 236, hereof, it should appear that there are evidence or signs of replacement, tampering or violation of the integrity of the ballots, The Commission shall not recount the ballots but shall forthwith seal the ballot box and order its safekeeping.<br></blockquote>Therefore, subject to the finding of whether or not the integrity of the affected ballot boxes and of their ballots has been&nbsp; preserved, the new returns from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A/33B, 70A, 71A, 72A, 83A and 84A shall be included in the canvass. Consequently, not only the votes of the mayoralty candidates, but also those of the candidates for vice-mayor and members of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> will&nbsp; be recounted and reflected in the new returns as basis of the canvass.&nbsp; On the basis of said canvass, the winning local candidates of the Municipality of Kabuntalan in the May 14, 2001 elections shall be proclaimed.<br><br><i>Fourth Issue: Whether SPC No. 01-342 should have been dismissed </i><br><br>Petitioner contends that the COMELEC should have dismissed SPC No. 01-342 since Samad failed to comply with the mandatory procedure provided in Section 20 of Republic Act (RA) No. 7166 and Section 38 of Comelec Resolution No. 3848.<br><br>Section 20 of RA No. 7166 provides:<br><blockquote> Sec. 20. <i>Procedure in Disposition of Contested Election Returns</i>. - (a) Any candidate x x x x contesting the inclusion or exclusion in the canvass of any election returns on any of the grounds authorized under Article XX or Sections 234, 235 and 236 of Article XIX of the Omnibus Election Code shall submit their oral objection to the chairman of the board of canvassers at the time the questioned return is presented for inclusion in the canvass.&nbsp; Such objection shall be recorded in the minutes of the canvass.<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx <br></div><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(c)&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Simultaneous with the oral objection, the objecting party shall also enter his objection in the form for written objections to be prescribed by the Commission. <b><u>Within twenty-four (24) hours from and after the presentation of such an objection, the objecting party shall submit the evidence in support of the objection</u></b> x x x (Emphasis supplied by petitioner Dagloc.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>Petitioner claims that Samad failed to submit her evidence in support of her objections within 24 hours from the time such objections were made, which is evidenced by the ruling of the Board issued on May 26, 2001.<br><br>Further, petitioner asserts that Paragraph 8, Section 38 of Comelec Resolution No. 3848 mandates that "[a]ny appeal brought before the Comelec on the ruling of the Board, without the accomplished forms and the evidence thereto, shall be summarily dismissed."<br><br>Petitioner thus contends that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it did not dismiss SPC No. 01-342 for failure to comply with the mandatory procedure under Section 20 of Republic Act No. 7166 and Section 38 of Comelec Resolution No. 3848.<br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>Petitioner is referring to Samad's appeal before the COMELEC of the Board's ruling to include in the canvass the election returns from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A and 33B.&nbsp; It appears that&nbsp; Samad submitted her evidence belatedly.&nbsp; It may be presumed that when Samad appealed from the Board's ruling before the COMELEC, the Board elevated its report and the complete records and evidence submitted in the canvass in accordance with Section 20, paragraphs (g) and (h) of Republic Act No. 7166, thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(g)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Immediately upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the board shall make an appropriate report to the Commission, elevating therewith the complete records and evidence submitted in the canvass, and furnishing the parties with copies of the report.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(h)</td> <td> <div align="justify">On the basis of the records and evidence elevated to it by the board, the Commission shall decide summarily the appeal within seven (7) days from receipt of said records and evidence.

Moreover, in their respective resolutions, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> and the Second Division evidently decided on the pre-proclamation cases filed before them based on the records and evidence elevated to them by the Board.<br><br>Further, the COMELEC has broad powers to ascertain the true results of the election by means available to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; It is not strictly bound by procedural rules in the attainment of this end. In fact, the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, wherein the aforecited Section 20 of RA No. 7166 is reiterated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> provides that said rules "shall be liberally construed in order to promote the effective and efficient implementation of the objectives of ensuring the holding of free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections and to achieve just, expeditious and inexpensive determination and disposition of every action and proceeding brought before the Commission."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Fifth Issue: Whether intervenor was denied due process</i><br></div><br>In regard to the petition-in-intervention filed by intervenor Mohidin Lauban, a&nbsp; co-respondent in SPC No. 01-310, it is contended that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction for: (1) failing to notify him about the proceedings in the consolidated cases including SPC No. 01-310, and thereafter annulling his proclamation in violation of his right to due process; and&nbsp; (2) ordering the exclusion of&nbsp; the nine election returns grounded on objections which were improper for a pre-proclamation controversy.<br><br>The Court has already ruled on the incorrectness of the order of the COMELEC to exclude outright the nine election returns from the canvass; hence, the remaining issue to be resolved is whether or not the intervenor was denied due process by the COMELEC.<br><br>Lauban contends that the COMELEC deprived him of his right to notice and hearing in all the proceedings conducted in SPC No. 01-310, wherein he was a co-respondent, as he was neither notified nor furnished a copy of the petition. Thereafter, Lauban asserts that the two resolutions of the COMELEC annulled and set aside his proclamation as vice-mayor of the Municipality of Kabuntalan, Maguindanao, despite prior knowledge by both the Second Division and the Commission e<i>n banc</i> that he was not duly notified and heard.<br><br>The contention is without merit.<br><br>The COMELEC, represented by the Solicitor General, countered that Lauban was not denied due process before the COMELEC.&nbsp; It observed that petitioner Dagloc and Lauban were party mates; the former was a candidate for mayor and the latter for vice-mayor during the May 14, 2001 elections. In SPC No. 01-310, Dagloc and Lauban and their candidates for Sangguniang Bayan were impleaded as respondents and their proclamations were sought to be annulled.<br><br>According to the COMELEC, Dagloc, Lauban and another private respondent in SPC-310, Fhamie Dumaba, were all represented by Abdul &amp; Maningas Law Offices as shown by the pleading, "Answer to Petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; A notice of hearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> was sent to Atty.

Kamid Abdul entered his appearance as counsel for Dagloc, <i>et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The COMELEC, therefore, correctly stated that Lauban, who was represented by a counsel who filed an answer, was notified of the hearing and had attended the hearing, cannot claim to have been denied&nbsp;&nbsp; due process by the COMELEC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition-in-intervention is denied for lack of merit, insofar as intervenor Mohidin S. Lauban claims that the COMELEC denied him due process.&nbsp; However, said petition-in-intervention and the petition for <i>certiorari</i> of Salipongan L. Dagloc are given due course insofar as they pray for the inclusion of the nine election returns in the canvass. The COMELEC is directed to determine within twenty (20) days from receipt of this Decision whether the integrity of the ballot boxes and the ballots from Precinct Nos. 31A, 31B, 32A/32B, 33A/33B, 70A, 71A, 72A, 83A and 84A has been preserved.
