				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant cannot be convicted of qualified rape, because the Informations did not allege his relationship with the victim.  Moreover, the latter's exact age at the time the crimes were committed was not proven by the prosecution.<br><br><center><u><b>The Case</b></u></center><br>For automatic review before this Court is the October 18, 1996 "Joint Judgment"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Palawan, Branch 52, in Criminal Case Nos. 12552, 12707 and 12708, finding Veno Esperas guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of rape.  The decretal portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused VENO ESPERAS guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of three counts of rape as charged in:<br><br>A.      CRIMINAL CASE NO. 12,552;<br>B.      CRIMINAL CASE NO. 12,707; and<br>C.      CRIMINAL CASE NO. 12,708; and as the commission of each of the offenses had been attended by the qualifying circumstance that, the offenses charged were committed against a victim below 18 years of age, and by an offender who is related to the offended party within the second degree of affinity, the accused is hereby sentenced to three (3) counts of death - one for each of the above entitled Criminal Cases - in the manner prescribed by law; to pay the offended party and complainant AAA civil indemnity of P50,000,00 for each of the three (3) offenses charged." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>In three separate Informations -- one dated August 29, 1995; and two, November 7, 1995 -- Prosecutor Reynaldo R.

After trial in due course, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered the assailed judgment.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts<br><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></u></b></center><br>In its Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution's version of the facts in the following manner:<br><blockquote>"In the morning of August 4, 1995, while the victim AAA was cooking breakfast, her brother-in-law, appellant Veno Esperas, arrived and requested her to buy medicine for his fighting cocks and to bring it to his house after attending her class. AAA, who was then a fifteen-year old <i>barrio</i> lass, had cordial relations with appellant who is the husband of her sister <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Elnora</span>.<br><br>"AAA bought the medicine after attending school.  She then proceeded to appellant's house at Sitio Landing, Barangay New Agutaya, San Vicente, Palawan, which is about two (2) kilometers away from her school. Only appellant was at home because his wife, the victim's sister, was away teaching at the far away town of Caruray, San Vicente, Palawan, where she and her child stayed during weekdays. Upon her arrival around 5:00 in the afternoon, the victim called the appellant and told him that she already bought the medicine he requested. Appellant appeared and went down the stairs.  While she was handing the medicine to him, appellant immediately held her hand, pulled her up the stairs and dragged her inside the house.<br><br>"When inside the house, appellant hastily pointed a ten-inch jungle knife on AAA's neck. The victim cried and shouted but appellant immediately covered her mouth with his hand.<br><br>"The victim told appellant not to proceed with his intentions because she treated him as her own brother but appellant told her not to treat him as her brother.  Her pleas went unheeded.  Appellant pushed AAA to lie down and proceeded to undress her of her uniform and underwear with his other hand. She kicked and struggled but she did not succeed in resisting appellant.<br><br>"Appellant thereby undressed. He then embraced and kissed the victim from her face to her vagina.  Appellant placed his finger on her private part and while lying on top of the victim, inserted his organ to her vagina.  The hapless victim felt pain.  After about [ten] seconds, appellant removed his organ from the victim's vagina and rested on top of her for 30 minutes.<br><br>"After resting, he again pointed his knife at AAA's neck.  She boxed and kicked appellant but she could not resist his strength. Appellant again inserted his organ to her genitalia and made a push and pull motion.  After ravishing the victim, appellant sat and rested beside her. AAA attempted to run but appellant grabbed her and prevented her from running.  In pain and feeling very weak, AAA was unable to escape.<br><br>"For the third time, he again poked the knife on AAA's neck and once more placed his organ inside her vagina.  He ravished her for ten minutes.  After satisfying his lechery, appellant ordered the victim to dress up. Appellant forewarned the victim not to tell anybody, otherwise, `<i>Hindi ako aatras, papatayin ko kayong lahat</i>.'<br><br>"The victim who was hardly able to stand slowly dressed herself and headed home.  She reached her house around 6:30 in the evening.  She saw her parents and siblings but she was unable to immediately disclose her ordeal because she feared for their lives.  In the succeeding days, however, her mother noticed that she looked weak and did not eat regularly.  She confided to her mother three days after the incident.  The victim's mother went to the police. AAA executed three (3) complaints against appellant.  The doctor who examined her days after the incident found that she suffered lacerations in her genitalia.  The medical certificate dated August 10, 1995, signed by Dr. Ruthelma Gejon stated:<br><blockquote>Grossly Female genitalia<br> Noted healed laceration at 3, 8 and 11 o'clock<br> Admits one finger with tenderness<br> Negative for spermatozoa<br></blockquote>"Based on her findings, the doctor concluded that the lacerations could have been caused by penetration or trauma."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></center><br>Appellant interposes the defense of denial.  His version of the facts is as follows:<br><blockquote>"The accused-appellant is a simple farmer, aged 25 years at the time of trial.  His marriage to <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Elnora</span> in 1993 was blessed with a child.  <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Elnora</span> teaches in a far place, which needs crossing the sea by pumpboat.  During schooldays, <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Elnora</span> and the child stay at her place of teaching assignment, leaving the accused-appellant alone at home to attend to their other concerns. Their house is a one-room nipa shack with a floor made of bamboo slats.<br><br>"Early in the morning of 4 August 1995, the accused-appellant went to the house of the accuser and asked her, being the younger sister of her wife, to buy some medicine for his fighting cocks, and to bring it to his house after class that day.  As told, the accuser bought the medicine and brought it to the house of accused-appellant after class.<br><br>"Upon reaching the house of accused-appellant, she called out to him.  She was on the ground, reaching out to him the medicine with her right hand. The accused-appellant was at the topmost part of stairs of his house.  The floor of the house or nipa shack is about one meter from the ground.  Thus, in the direct examination of the accuser.<br><blockquote>Q.   Is the flooring elevated from the ground? <br><br>A.    Yes, sir, about a meter high.</blockquote>"While the accuser was in the act of giving the medicine to the accused- appellant, the latter took hold of her right hand with his left hand, forcibly pulling her up the stairs of his house, and while facing her directly, covered her mouth with his hand as she was shouting loudly even while she was still outside the house.  The accused-appellant allegedly dragged her into his house, and when they were inside the house, pulled out from a scabbard tucked at the right side of his waist a jungle knife, poking the right side of her neck.  Even with a knife poked at her neck, she continued to shout.<br><br>"The accused-appellant forcibly pushed her to the floor, and the accused- appellant while holding the knife with one hand, undresse[d] her totally, removing her blouse, skirt, bra and panty with his free hand, even as she was continuously shouting for help, with her back pressed against the floor.  She was boxing, pushing, and kicking the accused-appellant.  But still the accused-appellant succeeded in sexually abusing her.<br><br>"At the time of the alleged sexual assault she was menstruating.  But she felt and touched blood in her vagina only after the third sexual intercourse.<br><br>"The accused-appellant removed her <i>palda</i> while he was on top of her.  As the accused-appellant removed her panty, the waistline of her panty got torn (although this was not presented as exhibit by the prosecution).<br><br>"On the second count of [the] alleged rape, the accuser testified that before raping her the second time, the accused-appellant poked the jungle knife to her neck.  And while the accused-appellant was poking the jungle knife to her neck, she again boxed him and kicked him but she could not resist his strength.<br><br>"The prosecution did not formally offer to prove that the accuser was a minor.<br><br>"The prosecution reserved the presentation of the birth certificate but never presented it in evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9] </sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><center><u><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></u></center><br>The RTC convicted appellant of three counts of rape for the following reasons.  <i>First</i>, more than his negative assertion, it was complainant's positive testimony that was given more weight. <i>Second</i>, the<i> </i>physical evidence -- the medical examination of complainant six days after the incident and the testimony of the examining physician -- was deemed to have corroborated the former's assertion that appellant had ravished her.<br><br>The trial court discarded the denial proffered by appellant, saying that no woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and expose herself and her family to a public trial, if she was not moved by the desire to have her ravisher punished. Moreover, because the close and cordial relations between her and appellant would be adversely affected by the filing of the charges, only the desire to seek justice could have motivated her and her mother to file the charges, against him.<br><br>Hence, this automatic review before us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b><center><u>The Issues</u></center></b><br>Appellant raises the following errors for our consideration:<br><br>"1.01.

Such struggle should have caused bodily injuries not confined only to the genitalia. Abrasions, hematoma or contusions should have resulted if he had indeed forcibly pulled her from the ground up to his house, which was about a meter above the ground. Moreover, a mark or cut would have been left on her neck, if he had truly poked a knife at it.<br><br>He adds as improbable the failure of his neighbors to hear her cries if she truly shouted for help. Among them was Ely Peralta who testified that she was inside her house, which was about 10 meters away from his, yet she did not hear any shouts at the time.<br><br>Allegedly unable to fathom why complainant and her mother would fabricate the charges against him despite his cordial relations with them, he contends that the trial court should not have applied the rule that no decent woman would file a rape charge if she was not motivated by the desire to seek justice.<br><br>We reject his arguments. The assigned errors, being essentially factual, may readily be explained upon a careful review of the records.<br><br><i>First</i>, the records do not show whether the victim suffered other bodily injuries. During the trial, questions on this matter were limited to the lacerations of her genitalia.  As to other injuries, none was propounded to her, her mother or the examining physician.<br><br><i>Second</i>, appellant did not pull the victim from the ground while he was still inside his nipa house.  She clearly testified that he had gone down the stairs; gripped her hand; and dragged her from there, up the stairs, and into the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  It was not improbable that the whole process left her unscathed, assuming that she was.<br><br><i>Third</i>, his claim that the victim did not suffer injuries when he poked a knife at her neck is of no moment.  It must be clarified that the word "poke" in the transcript was interchangeably used with the word "pointed,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which indicates that it was a rough translation of the Filipino word "<i>tinutok</i>." Naturally, a knife that does not touch the skin would not cause injury.<br><br>Nonetheless, the presence of injuries is not vital to establishing the guilt of appellant.  The alleged absence of external injuries on the victim does not detract from the fact that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Even, assuming <i>arguendo</i> that there were no signs of other bodily injuries, the occurrence of rape is still not negated, since their absence is not an essential element of the crime. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Neither is the fact of the rape weakened by the claim of appellant that none of his neighbors heard any shout for help from the victim.  As can be gleaned from the records, he quickly halted her shouts by covering her mouth with his hand and poking a knife at her neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  He also warned her that he would kill her if she made any noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  From time to time he silenced her succeeding shouts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> until she eventually became too weak to make any noise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thus, the circumstances surrounding the rapes are not implausible, as appellant would like this Court to believe. These are immaterial, as they refer to explainable details that have nothing to do with the essential fact of the commission of the crime of rape -- carnal knowledge through force or intimidation.<br><br>Appellant's denial cannot overcome the victim's positive assertion.  Mere denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, has no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary value than the positive testimony of a rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Time and time again this Court has said that when a woman -- more so when she is a minor -- says she has been raped, she says in effect all that is required to prove the ravishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, appellant failed to show any ill motive, on the part of the victim and her mother, to fabricate such a story.  A witness testifying candidly, trustworthily and consistently -- without any ill motive -- is surely more credible than an appellant who simply denies the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  "Where there is no evidence to show any improper motive on the part of the rape victim to testify falsely against the accused or to implicate him falsely in the commission of a crime, the logical conclusion is that the testimony is worthy of full faith and credence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The victim recounted how appellant -- armed with a knife --  defiled her thrice on that fateful day:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"FISCAL ESTOLANO</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">(cont)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">What else did he remove from his body?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He removed his pants and brief.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">After removing his brief, what did he do?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He again pointed the knife to me.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">While he was pointing the knife, I continued pushing him, but I cannot resist his strength.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;" colspan="2">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

competence and the credibility of witnesses are best determined by the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> because of its unique opportunity to observe their deportment while

substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28] </sup>  In the present case, the court <i>a quo </i>gave more credence to the positive testimony of the victim, and we find no reason to set aside its factual findings.<br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u>Second Issue:<br> <i>Physical Evidence</i></u></center><br>Appellant contends that the physical evidence from the medical examination is not consistent with the finding of rape.  He argues that the examining physician should not have concluded hastily that complainant had been raped, because the medical findings merely showed that her genitalia was positive for lacerations.  He adds that such lacerations are not conclusive of the commission of rape. Allegedly, although the examination was intended to determine its factual truth, the physician should not have rendered the conclusion that complainant had indeed been raped.  He further alleges that the doctor was not even an expert witness, having commenced medical practice only a year after she passed her licensure examination.  Moreover, her previous examinations on more than 10 rape victims supposedly resulted in inconclusive findings.<br><br>We disagree with appellant. While vaginal lacerations alone cannot establish rape, they are corroborative of its commission. The straightforward and unwavering testimony of the victim, coupled with her vaginal lacerations, proved that rape was committed, and that he was the perpetrator. It was the totality of evidence -- not the mere presence or absence of those lacerations -- that established his culpability for the offense charged.<br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u>Third Issue:<br> <i>Minority and Relationship</i></u></center><br>Appellant claims that the RTC imposed on him the penalty of death, because the trial court had appreciated the minority of the victim and his alleged relationship by affinity to her.<br><br>We are persuaded.<br><br><u style="font-weight: bold;"><i>Minority of the Victim</i><br> <i>Not Proven Beyond </i><br> <i>Reasonable Doubt</i></u><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>We agree with appellant that the minority of the victim was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to present her birth certificate despite its reservation to present it during the trial.<br><br>It must be noted that the rapes were committed prior to the effectivity of RA No. 8353, otherwise known as "The Anti-Rape Law of 1997." Applicable, then is the old provision -- Section 11 of RA No. 7659 -- which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 11.  Article 335 of the same Code is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><br><center>x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;            x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               x x x</center><br>`Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br><center>x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            x x x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            x x x</center><br>`The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>`1.      when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law- spouse of the parent of the victim.'"<br></blockquote>Minority not having been sufficiently established, the trial court committed reversible error in appreciating it as a qualifying circumstance; as such, it must be proved with equal certainty and clearness as the crime itself. Required, therefore, is independent proof of the age<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the victim, such as, her birth certificate or her mother's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The victim testified that she was born on August 14, 1979, and was thus 15 years old on the date of the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  On the other hand, her mother testified that she was born in September 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32] </sup>  These conflicting -- albeit casual -- testimonies cast a serious doubt on the victim's exact age at the time of rape.<br><br>In <i>People v.
