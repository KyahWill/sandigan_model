				<BR><STRONG>QUISUMBING, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On appeal is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated March 6, 2000, of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 110, finding appellant Joseph Dizon y Narido guilty of rape, imposing on him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordering him to indemnify private complainant Janice May Salvador the amount of P50,000, plus the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Appellant was charged in an information which reads:<br><blockquote> That on or about the 21<sup>st</sup> day of May, 1996, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Joseph Dizon y Narido, being armed with a gun, by means of force, threats and intimidation upon the person of Janice May Salvador, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the said complainant Janice May Salvador against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Appellant pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.<br><br>During trial, seven witnesses testified for the prosecution, including its principal witness, the private complainant Janice May Salvador.&nbsp; Hereunder is the prosecution's version of facts in the case.<br><br>Complainant Janice May Salvador testified she was fifteen years old, and had just graduated from Ramon Magsaysay High School at the time of the alleged incident. Sometime in early May 1996, her best friend and classmate Sheryl<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Manlulu confided to her through the phone, that she was upset because she (Sheryl) was supposed to meet with a certain Joseph Dizon, but the latter stood her up ("<i>Inindiyan siya</i>"). Janice was told that this Joseph had been courting Sheryl since April 1996.&nbsp; Sheryl then gave Joseph's number to Janice, pleading with the latter to call Joseph and find out why the latter did not show up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; Janice obliged and immediately called Joseph. She introduced herself as Sheryl's friend. In the course of their conversation, Joseph asked for her phone number.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thereafter, Joseph had become an occasional caller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Janice found him interesting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Their phone conversations generally dwelt on Sheryl and the state of Joseph's courtship.<br><br>On May 18, 1996, Joseph called Janice and asked her to accompany him to Sheryl's house on the 20<sup>th</sup> of May, as it was Sheryl's birthday. Janice advised Joseph to ask permission from Sheryl first.&nbsp; Sheryl in turn informed Joseph that the 20th was her enrollment day, and so Sheryl suggested instead that they visit her the following day, May 21<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; After asking permission from her mother, Janice agreed to meet Joseph on said date at the LRT Tayuman Station between 4:00 to 4:30 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On May 20, 1996, Joseph again called Janice.&nbsp; Aside from asking whether she had already greeted Sheryl on her birthday, to which she positively replied, Joseph described what he would be wearing the next day, so that Janice would easily recognize him at their first meeting.&nbsp; Joseph however told Janice that there was no need for her to describe herself, as Joseph already knew what she looked like from the pictures Sheryl had shown him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On May 21, 1996, Janice was awakened by a telephone call from Joseph, asking her to accompany him in buying a gift for Sheryl but Janice refused.&nbsp; Later that day, at the appointed hour, the two met.&nbsp; Joseph first saw Janice, called out to her, approached and introduced himself. They were talking as they climbed the stairs of the LRT station.&nbsp; Joseph's beeper suddenly sounded.&nbsp; Joseph stepped back, read the message and then told Janice it was his mother. Joseph then asked Janice to accompany him to the Manila Doctor's Hospital where his mother worked as a Medical Assistant. Janice was reluctant at first, because Sheryl might already be waiting for them.&nbsp; However, Joseph assured her that it would only be for a short while, and that it was important.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>They proceeded to the 7<sup>th</sup> floor of the hospital. Joseph entered a room, after which he asked Janice to come in as well.&nbsp; There, Joseph introduced her to his mother, saying, "Ma, si Janice, my friend."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Joseph's mother smiled at Janice.<br><br>As they were leaving the hospital, Joseph asked Janice to accompany him first to Pasay City in order to deliver some important documents. Again, Janice reminded him that they might be late for their appointment with Sheryl. Joseph however assured her that they won't take long, so Janice agreed to go.&nbsp; They again took the LRT and alighted at the Buendia station. From there they hailed an FX taxi, as Joseph told her it was quite far if they walked.&nbsp; Joseph opened the door of the taxi and got in beside Janice.&nbsp; He then whispered something to the driver, which Janice said she was unable to hear.&nbsp; Janice inquired from Joseph where they were bound, but Joseph only told her "<i>Diyan lang.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It was about 6:30 p.m. when they boarded the FX taxi.&nbsp; When she asked about the documents to be delivered, Joseph told her that they were the financial reports of his business.&nbsp; Janice then noticed that the taxi suddenly turned right in a very dark place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Janice asked Joseph why they made a sudden turn, and the latter justified it by saying that somebody had detected he was armed with a gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> He assured her that he would explain everything to her after they had alighted, as the taxi driver might hear them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The taxi entered a compound that appeared to Janice as an apartelle.&nbsp; They were ushered into a room on the second floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Inside, Joseph took out a calling card from his wallet and told Janice that he was going to call his "boss." Janice saw the name of a certain SPO Gagangco on the card.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Joseph instructed Janice to sit in the corner while he made the call.&nbsp; Their conversation was quite long and Janice only heard bits of it, with Joseph saying, "Send men as soon as possible because I have with me a girl."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Joseph then pulled out his firearm from his beltbag and toyed with the firearm while he talked on the phone.<br><br>Janice sat in the corner of the room, she was already panicky.&nbsp; She didn't know the place and was also told by Joseph that they would only go to that place "when the situation worsens."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> She then felt scared, for if the person who had detected Joseph was a policeman, she feared that she could get involved in his trouble.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>After hanging up, Joseph sat on the floor beside Janice and started to embrace her.&nbsp; Surprised, Janice blurted out, "<i>Putang ina mo.&nbsp; Anong nangyayari sa `yo?</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She tried to reach the main door and the door leading to the bathroom, in order to escape from Joseph, but he blocked the way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Joseph then chased her around the room while she, in turn, screamed and shouted for help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><b> </b>This prompted Joseph to poke a gun at her neck and threaten to kill her, saying, "Don't make me mad, I am going to kill you."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Frightened, Janice slumped in a corner of the room.&nbsp; Joseph then sat in front of her, and again started to embrace and kiss her.&nbsp; Janice tried to fight back, scream and push him away in vain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><b> </b>Joseph succeeded in removing her sleeveless cotton shirt and her brassiere, then kissed her all over her face, neck and breast and thereafter, unzipped and removed her pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Joseph dragged the complainant to the bed, laid her down and took off her panty.&nbsp; She kicked him and tried to remove his hands from her forearms but he proved too strong for her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Joseph then removed his pants and brief and positioned himself between her legs, at the same time pinning her down by holding her wrists with both of his hands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> She then felt Joseph's penis coming in and out of her organ, and she felt terrible pain.&nbsp; She felt so weak and scared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>After some time, Joseph stopped and she noticed a mucous-looking substance left in her pubic hair.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> She then covered her nudity with the bed sheet. She felt scared and mad at the same time.&nbsp; Joseph put on his brief, sat on the bed, and dialed Sheryl's phone number.&nbsp; He ordered Janice to tell Sheryl that they would be arriving soon.&nbsp; He also told her not to tell Sheryl about what had just happened and threatened her again.&nbsp; Out of fear, Janice complied and did as told.&nbsp; While Janice was on the phone, Joseph was beside her, holding his gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Janice then got dressed and hurriedly left the room.<br><br>Once outside the room, at the gate of the compound, she met two men to whom she related her ordeal.&nbsp; The two men, however, referred her to the cashier where she again narrated what she had gone through.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> She told them to report the matter to the police as Joseph was armed with a gun.&nbsp; However, she was ignored and even blamed for going with Joseph.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> After more or less 10 minutes, Joseph appeared before the cashier to pay the bill.&nbsp; Short of cash, Joseph asked money from her, but she did not give any. Instead, she discreetly exited towards the driveway.&nbsp; She again related her fateful experience to the guard at the driveway who then advised her to stay so she would not be harmed.&nbsp; Thereafter, a call on the intercom came through to the guard, and Janice was told that it was okay for her to leave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> At past 9:00 p.m. she left the compound of Queensland Lodge.&nbsp; She arrived home at 10:00 p.m.<br><br>As she was nearing her house, her father, Juanito Salvador, saw her and asked why she was late in coming home. Janice did not answer but instead rushed inside their house.&nbsp; Then she immediately told her mother, Myrna Salvador, everything that had happened to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The family sought the help of their policeman-neighbor who accompanied them to the Western Police District (WPD) station along Taft Avenue. They were immediately advised to go to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>At the NBI, the physical examination was conducted by the medico-legal officer, Dr. Eduardo Vargas, Jr. From the NBI, they were referred to the Pasay City Police Station.&nbsp; The police asked for the address of Joseph but Janice did not know it.&nbsp; Thus, Janice was instructed by the police to call Joseph at home to get the exact address, but the person who answered the phone did not entertain her call.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Together with the police, Janice and her father went to Queensland Lodge for ocular inspection and there, they were able to redeem Joseph's beeper and driver's license which Joseph had earlier used as security for the unpaid balance of his bill.&nbsp; From his driver's license they were able to determine Joseph's exact address.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The following day, May 22, 1996, Janice and her father returned to the police station where Joseph was already held in custody.&nbsp; Janice pointed to Joseph as the person who had raped her.<br><br>The defense presented appellant Joseph Dizon and his mother Ma. Cristina Narido Dizon as witnesses.&nbsp; In essence, appellant's defense is a variant of the "sweetheart theory", denying the charge but alleging that appellant and Janice had engaged in sex with her consent at the time and date in question. Hereunder is the defense's version of the incident.<br><br>Appellant Joseph Dizon testified that he got to know the complainant, Janice May Salvador, through the girl he was courting, namely Sheryl Manlulu.&nbsp; In the second week of April 1996, Joseph said Janice called him up on the phone and introduced herself as the best friend of Sheryl. Janice called in order to help him and Sheryl settle a petty argument.&nbsp; Prior to the telephone call, he had already heard Janice's name mentioned by Sheryl, but that was the first time they talked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The conversation lasted about 30 minutes. They exchanged personal information about each other, such as their likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc. Thereafter, Joseph and Janice would already exchange telephone calls.&nbsp; She called him about five times a week, while he would call her about thrice a week.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Joseph found Janice to be a nice person to talk to and very interesting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Eventually, they found themselves talking about more serious matters, with her asking him his preference in a woman, and him asking Janice the latter's concept of an ideal man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The phone conversations usually lasted 30 minutes on the average, and would happen at around 8:00 p.m.<br><br>On May 18, 1996, during another phone conversation, Joseph and Janice agreed to meet on May 21, 1996, at 2:00 p.m., at the LRT Tayuman Station.&nbsp; Janice had previously informed him that Sheryl's birthday was forthcoming. Joseph stated that Sheryl's birthday was actually on the 20<sup>th</sup> of May but he was informed by Janice that Sheryl will have a birthday party at her house on the 21<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; Thus, he made the date with Janice so that she can accompany him to Sheryl's house as it would be his first time to go there. Although he had been courting Sheryl for some time, he would visit her at her grandparents' house as Sheryl tended a store there.&nbsp; Appellant in fact had already professed his love for Sheryl at this time but she was not yet his girlfriend as they had some petty arguments.&nbsp; Joseph also suspected that Janice might have told Sheryl something against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On May 20, 1996, Joseph called Janice in order to finalize the date they had set for the following day, May 21.&nbsp; Since they haven't met before, they each described what they would be wearing.&nbsp; However, Joseph stated that he already had an idea of how she looked, based on Janice's photograph which Sheryl had shown him.&nbsp; He was also aware that Sheryl had shown Janice his picture.<br><br>On May 21, 1996, Joseph called Janice in the morning but was told by the person on the other end that Janice was still asleep.&nbsp; Later that day, Joseph arrived at the LRT Tayuman station at about 3:30 p.m.&nbsp; He was late due to the traffic and the fact that he came from Parañaque.&nbsp; Janice was not there when he arrived.&nbsp; He went down from the station and found a pay phone from which he called Janice at her house. He was informed that Janice had in fact left their house since early morning.&nbsp; He then called Sheryl's house, but the latter was also not around. Joseph asked the person who answered the phone if there was indeed a party there.&nbsp; He was informed that there was none.&nbsp; After hanging up the phone, Joseph again went up the LRT station. Joseph had a hunch that Janice was only roaming around the mall, thus, he also went around the mall and returned to the LRT station at around 4:30.&nbsp; Janice was already there waiting for him.&nbsp; Janice appeared friendly and they smiled at each other.&nbsp; After which, Joseph held her hand and apologized for being late.&nbsp; Janice said, "<i>Okey lang, sige</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Janice then told her that she had also been late because she had to pass by her school and also dropped by Sheryl's house as she had to talk to Sheryl.&nbsp; Joseph confronted her about the fact that he learned there was no party at Sheryl's house. Janice insisted that it was Sheryl who had told her.&nbsp; So, the two of them agreed to just stroll around, forgetting about their previous plan of going to Sheryl's party.&nbsp; Joseph then suggested they go first to his mother's office at the Manila Doctor's Hospital, located along U.N. Avenue.<br><br>Joseph said he was already courting Janice at this time.&nbsp; Since Janice already said bad things about him to Sheryl ("<i>Sinisiraan niya ako kay Sheryl</i>"), his attention became focused on Janice.&nbsp; Joseph added that a week after the first phone call from Janice, he and Sheryl argued over the phone.&nbsp; He suspected that Janice had bad-mouthed him before Sheryl.&nbsp; Sheryl was also asking him why he was courting Janice.&nbsp; Joseph denied that he was courting Janice. However, Joseph admitted that, on the same month of April, his attention had already shifted to Janice, and the reason he agreed to go to Sheryl's party was because of Janice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Joseph testified later on that he and Janice had been sweethearts since May 10.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Continuing his testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Joseph admitted he possessed a beeper that day, but he denied that the beeper sounded as Janice testified.&nbsp; Joseph said that the beeper was not his and he only found it that same day, near the LRT.&nbsp; According to him, it could not have sounded as the beeper was not operational then. Appellant said that he planned on turning over the beeper to the LRT security desk after he met Janice.&nbsp; The court then inquired why he left the beeper at the Queensland Lodge as security if it was not really his.&nbsp; Joseph replied that he did not have any money then and had nothing else to leave as collateral.&nbsp; Joseph denied that he had a gun in his possession, much less a holder of a license to possess one.<br><br>After meeting Janice at the LRT, they proceeded to the office of Joseph's mother who worked as a Medical Assistant at the Manila Doctor's Hospital.&nbsp; Joseph said this was for formality, so that his mother would get to know Janice. Joseph introduced Janice to his mother as his girlfriend.&nbsp; His mother was happy to meet Janice, his mother even said "so this is Janice your girlfriend whom you have always been talking to on the phone."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Janice, in turn, smiled and greeted his mother good afternoon.&nbsp; They left about 30 minutes after.<br><br>Joseph had planned on strolling around Makati with Janice so they took the LRT again and alighted at the Buendia Station.&nbsp; Janice had previously agreed but when they got off, she told him that she was tired and wanted to rest as she had been out of the house since morning.&nbsp; Appellant took it as a suggestion that Janice was in fact intimating indirectly that she wanted to go to bed with him.&nbsp; Thus, appellant told her that he knew of a place, Queensland motel, where she could rest.&nbsp; They took an FX taxi.&nbsp; Janice boarded first, assisted and followed by Joseph.&nbsp; The FX taxi proceeded to the Queensland Lodge at F.B. Harrison St. Upon arriving at the motel's compound, a roomboy opened the door.&nbsp; Janice alighted ahead of him as he was still paying for the fare.&nbsp; The roomboy then asked him whether they were staying for "short time" only, and he said yes.&nbsp; Janice was beside him while he was talking to the roomboy and was positive that she heard their conversation as the three of them were very near each other. The roomboy left and when he came back, led them upstairs to the second floor of the building, particularly Room 11 thereof.&nbsp; When the roomboy had left, Janice, who was sitting on the bed watching TV, invited him to sit beside her and watch the movie with her.&nbsp; They watched for about 10 minutes and then they started kissing. Joseph kissed Janice on the cheeks and forehead while holding her hands.&nbsp; Janice then asked him if he really loved her and he told her yes. Joseph added that even during their telephone conversations, he had already developed feelings for her and that during the time he and Sheryl had quarrels, it was Janice who comforted him. Janice paused to ask him why he loved her and what was it in her that he liked.&nbsp; Joseph answered that aside from being the one who comforted him, Janice was also "<i>mabait</i>" (kind), "<i>matalino</i>" (intelligent) and "<i>malambing</i>" (sweet).&nbsp; They continued kissing and since they were on the foot of the bed, they accidentally fell to the floor while they were kissing.&nbsp; They were then horsing around ("<i>Nagkukulitan kami</i>") on the floor.&nbsp; Joseph testified that while all this was going on, the door was closed but he had not locked it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Joseph also denied poking a gun at Janice while ordering her to undress.&nbsp; Joseph said this did not happen, as he did not have a gun.&nbsp; According to him, they undressed each other and no violence was used upon Janice to remove her clothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In tears, appellant again denied the charges against him, and stated that he loved Janice.<br><br>Continuing his testimony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> appellant said Janice seemed happy when he kissed her.&nbsp; He denied threatening her, saying that the truth was that they were lovers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In fact, it was Janice who removed her <i>maong</i> pants first, and then let him remove her panties while she was already lying on the bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Janice passionately kissed him back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Joseph went on to describe in detail their sexual encounter.&nbsp; He testified that only half of his private organ was able to penetrate Janice.&nbsp; He did so about three to five times before pulling it out as he was about to ejaculate and was afraid of impregnating her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> He did not attempt to insert the full length of his organ into her as, although she was already wet, he was so concerned as she was telling him it was painful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, according to appellant, he asked Janice to first call her parents so that they would not worry, as it was already past 8:00 in the evening.&nbsp; Janice did not do so, but instead called up Sheryl Manlulu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> He could hear her telling Sheryl that they were still together in his mother's office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Appellant claimed that the reason Janice testified against him was that her father did not like him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He said Mr. Salvador was reputedly very strict, and did not allow anyone to court his daughter, especially considering that Janice was the youngest child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Appellant also testified that Janice was beside him when he was settling the bill at the motel's cashier. It was true that he ran short of cash and asked Janice if he could borrow some money, but she replied <i>"Wala akong pera, bahala ka."</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Thus, he left his beeper and driver's license as security.&nbsp; Thereafter, Joseph wanted to take Janice home but she forbade him to do so, saying her father might kill her.&nbsp; Janice then boarded a jeep in front of the motel.&nbsp; Appellant walked towards Libertad Street where he borrowed money from a classmate.&nbsp; He reached home at 3:00 a.m.<br><br>Early the next day, Joseph was told by his grandmother that there were policemen who came to their house. Joseph then proceeded to the police headquarters at 8:00 p.m.&nbsp; From the headquarters, early the next day, May 23, Joseph called Mr. Salvador, asking what was going on.&nbsp; The latter said they would proceed to the headquarters right away.&nbsp; A confrontation ensued, but appellant denied that he raped Janice.&nbsp; He was detained right there and then.<br><br>On cross-examination, Joseph stated that Janice told him she was already 18 years old, as old as Sheryl, who also told him that she was 18.

The trial court also did not explain why and how it got the impression that the narration of the complainant was "direct and straightforward."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Insofar as the "substance" of the narration is concerned, appellant avers that there was insufficient discussion on the substance of complainant's testimony by itself and in relation to the other testimonial evidence adduced by the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Appellant further avers that the facts are simple and no difficult details are needed.&nbsp; Thus, he contends the trial court erred in concluding that "the detailed and minutiae manner of narration indicates sincerity and truthfulness, and thus, deserves credence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>For the appellee, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) contends that an examination of the testimony of Janice would disclose that she was forced or intimidated by appellant to submit to his carnal designs.&nbsp; Citing pertinent portions of the transcript of Janice's testimony, the OSG avers that Janice's credibility is beyond question, she gave a straightforward and honest account of what actually happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The OSG adds that Janice was lengthily and intensively grilled by the defense for possible loopholes in her testimony, or any disposition on her part to prevaricate.&nbsp; However, according to the OSG, there was not an instance that she faltered or gave a conflicting statement.&nbsp; All throughout, she was very firm and candid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Well-settled is the general rule that when the credibility of witnesses is at issue, appellate courts will not disturb the finding of the trial court on the ground that the trial court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses' deportment, demeanor, and manner of testifying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in exceptional cases will such finding be rejected where, for instance, the records reveal contradictory observations.&nbsp; After careful scrutiny of the records, particularly the testimony of private complainant Janice May Salvador, this Court finds no reason to disturb the findings of the trial court on the matter of credibility of witnesses for the prosecution.<br><br>Indeed, Janice's account of her ordeal in the hands of the appellant was straightforward, firm, candid and consistent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the rigid, lengthy and rigorous cross-examination of the defense, Janice May Salvador remained steadfast in her narration of the details of her harrowing experience.&nbsp; To us, the observations of the trial court were well-founded.&nbsp; A thorough reading of the transcript shows that Janice's testimony bears the earmarks of truth and credibility.<br><br>Thus, as held by this Court, "when the testimony of a rape victim is plain and straightforward, to the point and unflawed by any material or significant inconsistency, it deserves full faith and credit; certainly, it is one that cannot be discarded."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Appellant contends that the absence of vaginal lacerations and the absence of bleeding by the complainant, who was only 15 years old and a virgin, cast doubt on the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Citing <i>People v. Paragsa</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> appellant claims that "the absence of laceration in the vaginal walls of the minor private complainant negates the charge of rape."&nbsp; According to appellant, the absence of bleeding or laceration indicates that at the time of sexual encounter, complainant's organ was already adequately lubricated.&nbsp; Such lubrication can only come about in a consensual intercourse, says appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> citing: "No laceration, no forced copulation".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Appellant argues that the medical findings support his contention.&nbsp; The gynecological examination, according to the defense, found that the area around the hymen was abraded and contused on all sides.&nbsp; Hymen was intact, "distensible" and without any laceration.&nbsp; The defense adds that the abrasions and contusions were incurred in accord with the ordinary and natural deflowering of a virgin, hence the vaginal trauma attendant to a virgin's first sex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> This, plus an intact hymen, according to the defense, bolsters appellant's testimony that he inserted only half of his penis into complainant's vagina.&nbsp; With regard to the physical examination findings, appellant contends that it is simply highly improbable and incredible that despite the purported struggle in the course of a sexual assault, complainant only sustained such peculiarly localized abrasions.&nbsp; She incurred seven abrasions at the back of her arms which, according to the defense, are least expected to be found, considering the circumstances given. Thus, the defense concludes, the trial court did not have sufficient factual basis to conclude that the "medical findings further strengthened the story of complainant that she was forced to copulate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>In reply, the OSG maintains that the absence of vaginal lacerations does not negate the commission of rape.&nbsp; As explained by the examining physician, Dr. Vargas himself, penetration of the vagina does not necessarily produce laceration of the hymen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>&nbsp; The absence of extensive abrasions and contusions on the vaginal wall does not rule out rape because the slightest penetration is enough.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>The contention of the OSG is well-taken.&nbsp; That the victim's hymen is intact does not negate a finding that rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> In rape cases, a broken hymen is not an essential element thereof - a mere knocking at the doors of the pudenda, so to speak, by the accused's penis suffices to constitute the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> In this case, appellant himself testified that he inserted half the length of his penis into Janice's vagina.&nbsp; This is admission that sexual congress took place. Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the female organ, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen suffices to warrant conviction for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as testified to by Dr. Vargas, Janice's hymen was the distensible or elastic kind, in which case, it can be penetrated by an adult Filipino male organ in full erection without producing hymenal laceration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> This satisfactorily explains the absence of genital injury, according to the medico-legal officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>But the defense argues that the "incomplete penile penetration" merits another interpretation in favor of appellant's innocence.&nbsp; It is not improbable that due to a first timer's pain, and soft pleas from the private complainant, the appellant contented himself to half the pleasure and desisted from going deeper into her.&nbsp; This, according to the defense, is not the way a rapist behaves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Granting <i>arguendo </i>that there was incomplete penile penetration, this fact alone does not persuade us to accept appellant's sweetheart theory. Appellant could be the considerate and gentle lover he portrayed himself to be.&nbsp; But this would not detract from the pain and dishonor the victim suffered. Moreover, the records show, despite half-way penetration, appellant's carnal lust was satiated in full measure, as evidenced by his having reached orgasm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Nothing in the law of rape excuses appellant's offense simply because he claims he acted as a reluctant Lothario.<br><br>Appellant's defense also contends that complainant was not entirely blameless under the circumstances. She may even be faulted as negligent, according to appellant.&nbsp; Citing <i>People v.
