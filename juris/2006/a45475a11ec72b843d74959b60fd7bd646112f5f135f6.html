				<BR><STRONG>CALLEJO, SR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a Petition for Prohibition with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction filed by the Public Schools District Supervisor Association (PSDSA) seeking to declare as unconstitutional Rule IV, Section 4.3; Rule V, Sections 5.1 and the second paragraph of Section 5.2; and Rule VI, Section 6.2, paragraph 11 of Department of Education Order No. 1, Series of 2003.&nbsp; The petition likewise seeks to compel, by way of a writ of mandamus, the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to upgrade the salary grade level of the district supervisors from Salary Grade (SG) 19 to SG 24.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Antecedents<br><br></b></div>Ever since the Department of Education (DepEd)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> was founded decades ago, its management had been so centralized in the Manila office.&nbsp; Schools in the national, regional, and division levels merely followed and implemented the orders and memoranda issued by the Education Secretary.&nbsp; Due to the evolution of the learning process and the onset of information technology, there was a need for a radical change in the governance of the DepEd. &nbsp;Thus, a study on how to improve the management of the Department was conducted, and one of the proposals was the abolition of the office of the district supervisor.<br><br>Then Senator Tessie Aquino-Oreta, the Chairman of the Committee on Education, authored Senate Bill No. 2191, the thrust of which was to change the existing management style and focus on the schools where the teaching-learning process occurs. &nbsp;The bill was intended to highlight shared governance in the different levels in the DECS hierarchy and establish authority, accountability, and responsibility for achieving higher learning outcomes.&nbsp; While the governance of basic education would begin at the national level, the field offices (regions, divisions, schools, and learning centers) would translate the policy into programs, projects, and services to fit local needs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> &nbsp;The national level was likewise to be tasked to define the roles and responsibilities of, and provide resources to the field offices which would implement educational programs, projects, and services in communities they serve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> &nbsp;At the forefront would be the DepEd Secretary, vested with the overall authority and supervision over the operations of the department on the national, regional, division, and schools district level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Republic Act No. 9155, otherwise known as the "Governance of Basic Education Act 2001," became a law on August 11, 2001, in accordance with Section 27(1), Article VI of the Constitution. &nbsp;Under the law, each regional office shall have a director, an assistant director, and an office staff for program promotion and support, planning, administrative and fiscal services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; The regional director was given the authority to hire, place and evaluate all employees in the regional office except for the position of assistant director,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as well as the authority, accountability, and responsibility to determine the organization component of the divisions and districts, and &nbsp;approve the staffing pattern of all employees therein;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> evaluate all division superintendents and assistant division superintendents in the region;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and other functions as may be assigned by the proper authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>A division, on the other hand, is headed by a schools division superintendent with the following responsibilities, among others: to supervise the operations of all public and private elementary, secondary, and integrated schools, and learning centers;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to hire, place and evaluate all division supervisors and schools district supervisors as well as all employees in the divisions, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, including school heads, except for the assistant division superintendent;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and perform other functions as may be assigned by proper authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The office of the schools district supervisor has been retained under the law.&nbsp; Each district is headed by a school district supervisor and an office staff for program promotion.&nbsp; However, the responsibilities of the schools district supervisor are limited to the following: (1) providing professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and learning centers in the district or cluster thereof; (2) curricula supervision; and (3) performing such other functions as may be assigned by proper authorities.&nbsp; The schools district supervisors have no administrative, management, control or supervisory functions over the schools and learning centers within their respective districts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On the school level, an Elementary School Principal (ESP) was designated as school head for all public elementary schools; and a Secondary School Principal (SSP) for high schools or a cluster thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; The ESP and the SSP serve as both instructional leaders and administrative managers with the following authority, accountability and responsibility:<blockquote>(7)&nbsp;Administering and managing all personnel, physical, and fiscal resources of the school;<br><br>(8)&nbsp;Recommending the staffing complement of the school based on its needs;<br><br>(9)&nbsp;Encouraging staff development;<br><br>x x x x<br><br><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.375in;">(11) Accepting donations, gifts, bequests, and grants for the purpose of upgrading teachers'/learning facilitators' competencies, improving and expanding school facilities, and providing instructional materials and equipment.&nbsp; Such donations or grants must be reported to the appropriate district supervisors and division superintendents; and</div><br>(12) Performing such other functions as may be assigned by proper authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>Under Section 14 of the law, the DepEd Secretary is mandated to "promulgate the implementing rules and regulations within ninety (90) days after the approval of the Act, provided that the principle of shared governance shall be fully implemented within two (2) years" after such approval.<br><br>Before the DepEd could issue the appropriate implementing rules and regulations, petitioner sought the legal assistance of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) National Committee on Legal Aid to make representations for the resolution of the following administrative issues:<blockquote><ol><li>Restoration of the functions, duties, responsibilities, benefits, prerogatives, and position level of Public Schools District Supervisors.<br><br></li><li>Upgrading of Salary Grade level of Public Schools District Supervisors from Salary Grade Level 19 to Salary Grade Level 24 under DBM Circular No. 36, otherwise known as the Compensation and Position Classification Rules and Regulation.</li><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></ol></blockquote>In a Letter dated March 1, 2002 addressed to then DepEd Secretary Raul Roco, the IBP stated that, per its review of the documents submitted by the PSDSA, it found the latter's position valid and legal, to wit:<blockquote>First: The basis for the abolition of the position of District Supervisors under the Attrition Law and DECS Department Order No. 110, Series of 1991 is no longer valid and rendered moot and academic due to issuance of DECS Department Order No. 22, Series of 1996 and the passage by Congress of the Philippines of Republic Act No. 9155, otherwise known as the Basic Education Governance Act of 2000.&nbsp; Under R.A. 9155, school districts are mandated to be maintained and responsibilities of Public SchoolÃ¯Â¿Â½s Districts Supervisors have been clearly defined.<br><br>Second: There is a clear case of discrimination of grant of salaries and benefits to District Supervisors compared to salaries and benefits received by the School Principals - which position is lower in the hierarchy of positions as prepared by the Department of Education and the Department of Budget and Management. School Principals and District Supervisors enjoy the same level of Salary Grade even if the latter position is considered as a promotion and enjoys a higher level of position than that of the position of School Principals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>The PSDSA thus requested the DepEd Secretary to call an immediate consultation with the district supervisors nationwide through a convention, and their valid inputs be considered in formulating the rules and regulations to be urged by the DepEd.&nbsp; However, the Secretary failed to reply.&nbsp; Thus, the IBP reiterated the concerns raised by the PSDSA in a Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> to the DepEd dated April 15, 2002.<br><br>On January 6, 2003, DepEd Secretary Edilberto C. De Jesus issued DECS Office Order No. 1, which constitutes the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9155.&nbsp; Sections 4.1 to 4.3, Rule IV of the IRR provide:<blockquote>SECTION 4.1.&nbsp; <i><b>The Schools Division Superintendent</b></i>. - A division shall consist of a province or city which shall have a schools division superintendent.&nbsp; There shall be at least one assistant schools division superintendent and office staff for programs promotion, planning, administrative, fiscal, legal, ancillary, and other support services.<br><br>SECTION 4.2.&nbsp; <i><b>Authority, Accountability, and Responsibility of the Schools Division Superintendent</b></i>. - Consistent with the national educational policies, plans, and standards, the schools division superintendents shall have authority, accountability, and responsibility for the following:<br><blockquote><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">1) Developing and implementing division education development plans;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">2) Planning and managing the effective and efficient performance of all personnel, physical, and fiscal resources of the division, including professional staff development;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring, placing, and evaluating all division supervisors and schools district supervisors as well as all employees in the division, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, including school heads, except for the assistant division superintendents;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitoring the utilization of funds provided by the national government and the local government units to the schools and learning centers;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">5)&nbsp; Ensuring compliance of quality standards for basic education programs and for this purpose strengthening the role of division supervisors as subject area specialists;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting awareness of, and adherence by, all schools and learning centers to accreditation standards prescribed by the Secretary of Education;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">7) Supervising the operations of all public and private elementary, secondary, and integrated schools, and learning centers; and</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-indent: -0.3in;">8)&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing such other functions as may be assigned by the Secretary and/or Regional Director.<br></div></blockquote>SECTION 4.3.&nbsp; <i><b>Appointing and Disciplinary Authority of the Schools Division Superintendent</b></i>. - The schools district superintendent shall appoint the division supervisors and school district supervisors as well as all employees in the division, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, including school heads, except for the assistant schools division superintendent, subject to the civil service laws, rules and regulations, and the policies and guidelines to be issued by the Secretary of Education for the purpose.<br><br>The schools division superintendent shall have disciplinary authority only over the non-teaching personnel under his jurisdiction.<br><br>Such exercise of disciplinary authority by the schools division superintendent over the non-teaching personnel shall be subject to the civil service laws, rules and regulations, and procedures and guidelines to be issued by the Secretary of Education relative to this matter.<br><br>The Regional Director shall continue exercising disciplinary authority over the teaching personnel insofar as the latter are covered by specific and exclusive disciplinary provisions under the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers (R.A. No. 4670).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]<br></sup></blockquote>Sections 5.1 and 5.2, Rule V of the IRR, in turn, provide:<blockquote>SECTION 5.1.&nbsp; <i><b>The Schools District Supervisor</b></i>. - A school district shall have a school district supervisor and office staff for program promotion.<br><br>The schools district supervisor shall primarily perform staff functions and shall not exercise administrative supervision over school principals, unless specifically authorized by the proper authorities.&nbsp; The main focus of his/her functions shall be instructional and curricula supervision aimed at raising academic standards at the school level.<br><br>The schools district supervisor shall be specifically responsible for:<blockquote>1) Providing professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and learning centers in the district or cluster thereof;<br>2) Curricula supervision; and<br>3)&nbsp;Performing such other functions as may be assigned by the Secretary, Regional Directors, and Schools Division Superintendents where they belong.</blockquote>The schools district supervisor being mentioned in this section shall refer to a public schools district supervisor.<br><br>SECTION 5.2.&nbsp; <i><b>The School District</b></i>. - A school district already existing at the time of the passage of this Act shall be maintained.&nbsp; However, an additional school district may be established by the regional director based on criteria set by the Secretary and on the recommendation of the schools division superintendent.&nbsp; For this purpose, the Secretary of Education shall set standards and formulate criteria as basis of the Regional Directors of the establishment of an additional school district.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>On March 13, 2003, the PSDSA, the national organization of about 1,800 public school district supervisors of the DepEd, in behalf of its officers and members, filed the instant petition for prohibition and mandamus, alleging that:<blockquote><ol style="text-align: justify;" type="I"><li>THE ACT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN REMOVING PETITIONERS' ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERVISION OVER ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND ITS PRINCIPALS (SCHOOL HEADS) WITHIN HIS/HER DISTRICT AND CONVERTING HIS/HER ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION TO THAT OF PERFORMING STAFF FUNCTION FOR THE DIVISION OFFICE PER SECTION 5.1 RULE V OF THE IMPLEMENTING RULES AND REGULATIONS OF REPUBLIC ACT 9155 (DEPED ORDER NO. 1, SERIES OF 2003) IS A GROSS VIOLATION OF REPUBLIC ACT 9155 - THE GOVERNANCE OF BASIC EDUCATION ACT OF 2001.<br><br></li><li>THE IMPLEMENTING RULES AND REGULATION OF REPUBLIC ACT 9155 AS PROMULGATED UNDER DEPED ORDER NO. 1, SERIES OF 2003 EXPANDED THE LAW AND INCLUDED PROVISIONS WHICH ARE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE SUBJECT LAW.<br><br></li><li>THE DOWNGRADING OF SALARY GRADE LEVEL OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT SUPERVISOR OR THE NEGLECT OR REFUSAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT TO UPGRADE THE SALARY GRADE LEVEL OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT TO A RESPECTABLE LEVEL OF SALARY GRADE HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE PRINCIPALS - DESPITE CLEAR INTENTION OF R.A. 9155 TO RETAIN THE POSITION OF PSDS IN THE HIERARCHY OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGERS AND OFFICERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION - IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners maintain that the questioned provisions of the IRR are invalid because they "extended or expanded and modified" the provisions of R.A. No. 9155. &nbsp;They argue that the said law should be read in harmony with other "existing educational laws" which it did not specifically repeal, such as <i>Batas Pambansa Blg.</i> 232, otherwise known as "The Education Act of 1982," as amended by R.A. No. 7798; R.A. No. 4670, otherwise known as the "Magna Charta for Public School Teachers"; and R.A. No. 7784 captioned "An Act to Strengthen Teacher Education in the Philippines by Establishing Centers of Excellence, Creating a Teacher Education Council for the Purpose, Appropriating Funds Therefore, and for Other Purposes."<br><br>Petitioners assert that under Section 7(D) of R.A. No. 9155, the district offices of the DepEd are intended as field offices where the district supervisors can assist the ESPs and teachers/learning facilitators within their district as experienced educational managers.&nbsp; Thus, the district supervisors were not divested of the inherent administrative functions to manage and oversee the schools within their respective districts, including their subordinates.&nbsp; They emphasize that the law provides an "office staff for program promotion" in the school districts, which would be of no use if the office has no administrative supervision over schools within its respective districts.<br><br>Petitioners assert that under the IRR, the schools district supervisors <i>primarily perform staff functions and shall not exercise administrative supervision over school principals, unless specifically authorized by the proper authorities.</i>&nbsp; Thus, under the IRR, the exercise of administrative supervision over school principals was made discretionary and subject to the whims and caprices of "the proper authorities."&nbsp; The logical inference of this provision, petitioners aver, is that the administrative supervisory powers can be withdrawn from a district supervisor without any reason at all, a provision which has no basis in the enabling law.<br><br>Petitioners further contend that the DepEd has no authority to incorporate its plan of downgrading the position of district supervisor, that is, from being an administrator of a particular district office to a position performing a staff function, to exercise administrative supervision over the school principals only when specifically authorized by proper authorities. Petitioners insist that respondent Education Secretary was focused on removing the level of management in the district office, such that the IRR empower school heads (principals) to have administrative and instructional supervision of school or cluster of schools, while supervision of all public and private elementary, secondary, and integrated schools and learning centers was given to the division office.<br><br>Petitioners further insist that respondent Education Secretary failed to consider the fact that R.A. No. 9155 strengthened the district office as a mid-level administrative field office of the DepEd. &nbsp;The law even mandates to allow the district supervisor to have an office staff for program promotion in the district office. &nbsp;Apart from the current administrative functions inherent in the district office, DECS Service Manual 2000 vested additional specific functions to the district offices, to provide professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and learning centers in the district, as well as curricula supervision.<br><br>Petitioners posit that R.A. No. 9155 did not, in anyway, allow or authorize the reorganization of the entire DepEd; it never reduced the position, rank, classification, and salary grade level of district supervisors, nor abolished the district offices which are responsible for the administration and management of elementary schools within its jurisdiction. &nbsp;It did not remove from the district supervisors the function of administrative supervision over schools within their respective areas. &nbsp;In fact, petitioners insist, what the law did was to give the district supervisor additional responsibility of providing professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and learning centers in the district or cluster thereof.<br><br>Petitioners point out that under Section 4.3, paragraph (b), Rule IV of the IRR, the schools division superintendent was given the power to appoint the division supervisors and schools district supervisor and other employees subject to civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and the policies and guidelines to be issued by the Secretary of Education for the purpose.&nbsp; On the other hand, the school division superintendent shall have disciplinary authority only over the non-teaching personnel under his jurisdiction.&nbsp; Such exercise of disciplinary authority by the schools division superintendent over the non-teaching personnel shall be subject to civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and procedures and guidelines to be issued by the Secretary of Education relative to this matter.&nbsp; The regional director shall continue exercising disciplinary authority over the teaching personnel in so far as the latter are covered by specific and exclusive disciplinary provisions under the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers (R.A. 4670).<br><br>Petitioners posit that this grant of disciplining authority to the regional director for teaching personnel who commit violations of laws, rules, and regulations is definitely not provided for in R.A. No. 9155.&nbsp; The division superintendent was given the power not only to hire and appoint the division supervisors, district supervisors, school heads, or principals as well as employees in the division, both teaching and non-teaching positions. However, when it comes to disciplining officers and teaching personnel who commit infractions or violations of law, rules, and regulations of the DepEd, the exercise of such disciplining authority is lodged in the hands of the regional director. &nbsp;Petitioners point out that the power to hire teachers is in the hands of the division superintendent; principles of administrative rules and procedure provide that the authority to hire and appoint carries with it the authority to discipline and fire the hired and appointed personnel particularly if the law is silent thereon.&nbsp; Since the division superintendent has the authority to hire teaching personnel within its division, he/she should also take the responsibility of disciplining erring teachers and employees.&nbsp; If the set-up of placing the power of hiring and power to discipline or fire an errant personnel is separated or divided between two offices of the DepEd, the proliferation of "<i>palakasan</i>" or "<i>bata-bata"</i> system will flourish, to the detriment of the public education system and public service.<br><br>Petitioners also point out that under Section 7(E)(11) of R.A. No. 9155, school heads are authorized to accept gifts, donations, bequests, and grants for the purpose of upgrading teacher's/learning facilitator's competencies, improving and expanding school facilities and providing instructional materials and equipment, which, in turn, shall be reported to the appropriate district supervisors and division superintendents. &nbsp;However, under Section 6.2(11), Rule VI of the IRR, on the authority, accountability, and responsibility of school heads, district supervisors were deleted as one of the administrative officers to whom such reporting is to be made.&nbsp; Petitioners conclude that to the extent that the division superintendents are not mandated to report donations and grants to district supervisors, the IRR is void.<br><br>On their plea for mandamus, petitioners pray that the Court compel the DepEd and the DBM to upgrade their present salary grade. They claim that the position of an ESP is already classified as SG 21, which is higher by two grades than that of district supervisors, SG 19. &nbsp;Considering their higher position in the department's pecking order, vis-Ã -vis that of the ESPs, petitioners opine that to rectify the present grade-level distortion, their salary grade should be upgraded to SG 24.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) avers that a perusal of Section 7(D) of R.A. No. 9155 shows that the district supervisor has limited responsibilities, and that the power to exercise administrative supervision over the ESPs is not covered by any of those responsibilities. &nbsp;The Education Secretary is the disciplining authority in the DepEd, with the regional directors acting as the disciplining authority in their respective regions.<br><br>As to petitioners' gripe that the IRR deleted district supervisors from among those school heads who should report when "[a]ccepting donations, gifts, bequests, and grants for the purpose of upgrading teachers'/learning facilitators' competencies, improving and expanding school facilities, and providing instructional materials and equipment," the OSG avers that&nbsp; this reportorial function is "directory" and merely for "convenience."<br><br>Anent petitioners' grievance on their alleged stagnant salary grade level, the OSG points out that the same is "already provided for under FY 2003 GAA, [thus], petitioners' complaint against the non-increase of their SG level is already moot and academic."&nbsp; The OSG also emphasizes that the upgrading of the ESP's salary grade over the petitioners is not violative of petitioners' right to equal protection of the law, since "district supervisors and ESPs are not similarly situated."<br><br>In reply, petitioners contend that the upgrading of the salary grade level of district supervisors to SG 21 is an admission by the DepEd and by the DBM of the validity of their demand to increase their salary grade to a respectable SG 24.<br><br>The petition is partially granted.<br><br>It must be stressed that the power of administrative officials to promulgate rules in the implementation of a statute is necessarily limited to what is provided for in the legislative enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The implementing rules and regulations of a law cannot extend the law or expand its coverage, as the power to amend or repeal a statute is vested in the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; It bears stressing, however, that administrative bodies are allowed under their power of subordinate legislation to implement the broad policies laid down in a statute by "filling in" the details.&nbsp; All that is required is that the regulation be germane to the objectives and purposes of the law; that the regulation does not contradict but conforms with the standards prescribed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, as a matter of policy, this Court accords great respect to the decisions and/or actions of administrative authorities not only because of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed knowledgeability and expertise in the enforcement of laws and regulations entrusted to their jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> &nbsp;The rationale for this rule relates not only to the emergence of the multifarious needs of a modern or modernizing society and the establishment of diverse administrative agencies for addressing and satisfying those needs; it also relates to the accumulation of experience and growth of specialized capabilities by the administrative agency charged with implementing a particular statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>We have reviewed the IRR and find that Section 4.3 of Rule IV, and Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of Rule V are valid.&nbsp; The provisions merely reiterate and implement the related provisions of R.A. No. 9155.&nbsp; Under the law, a division superintendent has the authority and responsibility to hire, place, and evaluate all division supervisors and district supervisors as well as all employees in the division, both teaching and non-teaching personnel, including school heads.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; A school head is a person responsible for the administrative and instructional supervision of the schools or cluster of schools.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; The division superintendent, on the other hand, supervises the operation of all public and private elementary, secondary, and integrated schools and learning centers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Administrative supervision means "overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that their subordinate officers perform their duties.&nbsp; If the latter fails or neglects to fulfill them, the former may take such action or steps as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>A plain reading of the law will show that the schools district supervisors have no administrative supervision over the school heads; their responsibility is limited to those enumerated in Section 7(D) of R.A. No. 9155, to wit:<blockquote>(1) Providing professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and learning centers in the district or cluster thereof;<br><br>(2) Curricula supervision; and<br><br>(3) Performing such other functions as may be assigned by proper authorities.</blockquote>As gleaned from the Senate deliberations on Senate Bill No. 2191, the district supervisors were divested of any administrative supervision over elementary and public high schools.&nbsp; The Senate resolved to vest the same in the division superintendents, and the Lower House concurred.&nbsp; Senator Rene Cayetano proposed that the traditional function of the school supervisors of exercising administrative supervision over the elementary and public high schools be maintained.&nbsp; However, Senator Tessie Aquino-Oreta, the Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Education and the Sponsor of the Bill, objected to such proposal:<blockquote><dl><dt>The President:</dt><dd>Why do we not say AND SHALL NOT BE INCLUDED?<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd>Yes, better yet, Mr. President.&nbsp; I thank the Chair for that amendment.<br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>All right.&nbsp; Can we approve that?&nbsp; The sponsor accepts the amendment, I assume.<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Aquino-Oreta:</dt><dd>Yes, Mr. President.<br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>Is there any objection from the floor?&nbsp;

I just want it to be there to ensure that their primary functions remain as such.<br><br></dd><dd>Therefore, what appears as paragraph (b) in line 18 will now be subparagraph (c).<br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>What does the sponsor say?<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Aquino-Oreta:</dt><dd>Mr. President, may I just explain.&nbsp; There are two school supervisors.&nbsp; One is for the academic function and the other is for the administrative function.&nbsp; As such, if these two supervisors will dictate to the principals, then our thrust in reducing the level of bureaucracy might not be met.&nbsp; Also, the thrust of this governance bill really is to flesh out the importance of the school as the heart of education here.&nbsp; In that heart, we have the teacher, the student, and the school head.<br><br></dd><dd>What we are trying to do here is to bring to the forefront the school itself.&nbsp; In fact, right now, there is a move in the DECS to do away with the school supervisor in charge of administrative and leave that function to the principal.&nbsp; If the principal, the school head will be dictated upon by these two school supervisors, we might not be able to achieve what we want to do here - putting to the forefront the school itself.&nbsp; Meaning, putting to the forefront the school head, the teacher, and the student.<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd>Mr. President, I would like to thank the sponsor for that enlightenment.&nbsp; That is precisely my point.<br><br></dd><dd>Not too long ago, I was a speaker before the school supervisors all over the land.&nbsp; One of the points that they complained about was, in most cases, their job to supervise school principals is now being removed or have been removed simply because - and I may be inaccurate here - the Japanese government - I know it is a foreign government that funded a study of the organizational setup of the DECS - has recommended the abolition of school supervisors.<br><br></dd><dd><u>This is the reason this representation would like to ensure that the traditional function of the school supervisors, among which is to supervise school principals, remain as such.&nbsp; What is good for the Japanese education is not necessarily good for the Philippines.&nbsp; This representation knows that this is precisely one of the complaints of the school supervisors.</u><br><br></dd><dd><u>The lady sponsor admitted that, indeed, there is an effort to phase out the school supervisors.&nbsp; That is precisely my point, Mr. President.&nbsp; I do not want the school supervisors to be phased out simply because a foreign government which funded the study of our education has suggested it.</u><br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>What does the sponsor say?<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Aquino-Oreta:</dt><dd>Mr. President, actually, it is not Japanese.&nbsp; It is an ADB proposal to the DECS.&nbsp; The DECS had a study made on how to improve the management order of the DECS.&nbsp; That was one of the proposals.&nbsp; They gave three proposals.&nbsp; One of them was to take out the school supervisors.<br><br></dd><dd><u>But precisely, Mr. President, we are not doing that, we are not taking them out.&nbsp; What we are saying is for the school supervisor to focus on the curriculum because in the administration of the affairs of the school, we are saying that the principal knows best how to administer or how to run the school better.&nbsp; And so, we are saying here that school supervisors will be there contrary to the view of that ADB study.&nbsp; We will maintain them, but the focus of the school supervisors will be on the curriculum of the schools.</u><br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd>Mr. President, again I thank the lady senator.&nbsp; But again let us look at who supervisors of schools are.&nbsp; Supervisors of schools once upon a time were all school principals.&nbsp; They rose from the ranks, that is why they are fully aware of the administrative as well as the instructional capability of the principals now who are under them.&nbsp; To remove their right to supervise, - now it is the ADB, I am correct, the lady senator is correct because as I said I was not sure - to remove this traditional function would really render the supervisors practically without anything to do.&nbsp; That is why they are now being justified that henceforth there will be no principals that will be promoted as school supervisors because when the school supervisors reach the age of retirement and retire, no principals shall be promoted to that level.&nbsp; But these school supervisors now, Mr. President, were once upon a time in their professional lives principals, and they know best how the schools should be run - administratively and instructionally.&nbsp; That is the reason for that, Mr. President.<br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>What does the sponsor say?<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd>So, may I ask the sponsor to accept this, Mr. President.<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Aquino-Oreta:</dt><dd>Mr. President, what was the amendment?<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd><u>To insert a new paragraph, paragraph (b) in line 18, which states: SUPERVISE SCHOOL PRINCIPALS IN THE DISTRICT.</u><br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>May I suggest, <u>THE SUPERVISION OF SCHOOL PRINCIPALS IN THE DISTRICT, because</u> -<br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd>Yes, Mr. President.<br><br></dd><dt>The President:</dt><dd>- the antecedent for that is, <u>"The schools district supervisor shall be responsible for."</u><br><br></dd><dt>Senator Cayetano:</dt><dd>That is right, Mr. President.&nbsp;

No. 9155, administrative supervision over school heads is not one of those responsibilities conferred on district supervisors.<br><br>It is a settled rule of statutory construction that the express mention of one person, thing, act, or consequence excludes all others. This rule is expressed in the familiar maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>. &nbsp;Where a statute, by its terms, is expressly limited to certain matters, it may not, by interpretation or construction, be extended to others. The rule proceeds from the premise that the legislature would not have made specified enumerations in a statute had the intention been not to restrict its meaning and to confine its terms to those expressly mentioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>It is not surprising that Senator Aquino-Oreta maintained her position that district supervisors should not have administrative control or even supervision over ESPs and SSPs.&nbsp; As early as 1990, the DECS had adopted the policy that, effective January 1, 1991, the positions of district supervisors and division supervisors would be gradually phased out by not filling-up these positions as they become vacant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; On September 17, 1991, then DECS Secretary Isidro CariÃ±o issued DECS Order No. 110, Series of 1991, declaring that, to foster better considerations and articulation of progress in the elementary level, all elementary school principals shall report directly to the school division superintendents.&nbsp; In his Order dated June 22, 1994, then DECS Secretary Armand V. Fabella declared that DECS Order No. 110 shall remain in effect, with the recommendation that, in order to facilitate the phase-out of district supervisor positions, incumbent district supervisors were encouraged to transfer to vacant division supervisor positions, provided they meet the qualification standards for such positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; For his part, in his DECS Order No. 22, Series of 1996, DECS Secretary Ricardo T.

No. 9155 to conform to the basic thrust and objectives of the law.&nbsp; Far from strengthening the office of the district supervisors as a mid-head field office of the DepEd, the law limited the authority and responsibility attached to such position.<br><br>While it is true that the district supervisor is given a support staff for program promotion, it cannot thereby be implied that he/she likewise has administrative supervision over ESPs and SSPs.&nbsp; Such a construction has no basis in law and in fact.&nbsp; Indeed, such a construction of the statute defeats the very purpose of the law.<br><br>It is a basic precept that the intent of the legislature is the controlling factor in the interpretation of the statute.&nbsp; The particular words, clauses, and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated expression, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce a harmonious whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Besides, Congress enumerated the duties and responsibilities of a district supervisor. Congress would not have made specific enumerations in a statute if it had the intention not to restrict or limit its meaning and confine its terms only to those expressly enumerated. Courts may not, in the guise of interpretation, enlarge the scope of a statute and include situations not provided nor intended by Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The submission of the OSG, that the schools district supervisors have the administrative supervision over school heads, is more in accord with the law, to wit:<blockquote>Section 7 of RA 9155, on School District Level, pertinently provides that <i>"a school district shall have a school district supervisor and an office staff for program promotion," </i>and that the schools district supervisor shall be responsible for: (1) <i>"(p)roviding professional and instructional advice and support to the school heads and teachers/facilitators of schools and learning centers in the district [or] cluster thereof;" </i>(2) <i>"(c)urricula supervision;" </i>and, (3) <i>"(p)erforming such other functions as may be assigned by the proper authorities."</i><br><br>A perusal of Section 7 shows that the District Supervisor has limited responsibilities, and that the power to exercise administrative supervision over the ESPs is not covered by responsibility nos. 1 and 2. Neither is that power covered by the directive that the District Supervisor shall have an office staff for program promotion. The only logical conclusion, therefore, that can be derived from the aforesaid enumeration of responsibilities is that the District Supervisor may only exercise administrative supervision over ESPs when such function is assigned by proper authorities. And, since the DepEd Secretary specifically declared through the IRR of RA 9155, that the District Supervisor shall not exercise administrative supervision over the ESPs, unless otherwise authorized, petitioners cannot complain against the said declaration. On this score, it is settled that the intent of the statute is the law (<i>Philippine National Bank v. Office of the President,</i> 252 SCRA 5 [1996]). In the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, words and phrases used in a statute should be given their plain, ordinary and common usage meaning (<i>Mustang Lumber, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>, 257 SCRA 430 [1996]).<br><br>Needless to say, Section 7, on Division Level, further provides that the School Division Superintendent shall have authority, accountability and responsibility for, among others, <i>"(s)upervising the operation of all public and private elementary, secondary and integrated schools, and learning centers." </i>To claim, therefore, that the District Supervisor has administrative supervision over the ESPs would also violate the above-quoted provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>The Court likewise declares that the last paragraph of Section 4.3 of the IRR, stating that the regional director shall continue exercising disciplinary authority over the teaching personnel insofar as the latter are covered by specific and exclusive disciplinary provisions under R.A. No. 4670 ("Magna Carta for Public School Teachers") does not contravene R.A. No. 9155.&nbsp; Indeed, the IRR merely reiterates the DECS Rules of Procedure, DECS Order No. 33, issued on March 30, 1999 by the DepEd Secretary, and R.A. No. 4670 which was approved on June 18, 1966, and pursuant to Section 7, Chapter II, Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code, which provides that the DepEd Secretary is empowered to<blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out department objectives, policies, functions, plans, programs, and projects; and</li><br><li>Promulgate administrative issuances necessary for the efficient administration of the offices under the Secretary and for execution of the laws relative thereto.</li></ol></blockquote>Additionally, the IRR was issued by the DepEd Secretary pursuant to Section 7(A)(1) of R.A. No. 9155, which mandates that the Secretary formulate national educational policies and enhance the employment status, professional competence, welfare, and working conditions of all the DepEd personnel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>We agree that R.A. No. 9155 does not provide who has disciplinary authority over the teaching personnel of the DepEd.&nbsp; However, under Section 3, Chapter III of DECS Order No. 33, Series of 1999, otherwise known as the 1999 DECS Rules of Procedure, the disciplining authority in the DECS is the DepEd Secretary, with the regional directors acting as such in their respective regions except those appointed by the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The officers and employees referred to in the Rules of Procedure include teachers who, under R.A.

No. 4670 or under the DECS Rules of Procedure.&nbsp; In fact, under Section 2, Chapter VII of such Rules of Procedure, a division superintendent is a chairperson of the investigating committee over formal complaints filed against such teachers:<blockquote><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.3in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.375in;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the respondent is an elementary or secondary school teacher, head teacher, principal, district supervisor/chair/coordinator or Education Supervisor I -</div><br><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.575in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.3in;">(1)&nbsp; The schools division superintendent or his or her duly authorized representative, as chairperson;</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.575in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.3in;">(2) The duly authorized representative of the school, district, or division teacher's organization, as member; and</div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.645in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.375in;">(3)&nbsp; The division supervisor for elementary or secondary education where the respondent belongs, as member.</div></blockquote>The foregoing rule is based on Section 9 of R.A. No. 4670 which reads:<blockquote>Sec. 9. &nbsp;Administrative Charges.&nbsp; Administrative charges against a teacher shall be heard initially by a committee composed of the corresponding School Superintendent of the Division or a duly authorized representative who should, at least, have the rank of a division supervisor, where the teacher belongs, as chairman, a representative of the local or, in its absence, any existing provincial or national teacher's organization and a supervisor of the Division, the last two to be designated by the Director of Public Schools. The committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the Director of Public Schools within thirty days from the termination of the hearings: <i>Provided, however, </i>That where the school superintendent is the complainant or an interested party, all the members of the committee shall be appointed by the Secretary of Education.</blockquote>Anent the issue on reporting of acceptance of donations, Section 7(E)(11) of R.A. No. 9155 provides:<blockquote>(11) Accepting donations, gifts, bequests, and grants for the purpose of upgrading teachers'/learning facilitators' competencies, improving and expanding school facilities, and providing instructional materials and equipment.&nbsp; <b>Such donations or grants must be reported to the appropriate district supervisors and division superintendents</b>.&nbsp; (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>However, Section 6.2(11), Rule VI of the IRR provides that:<blockquote>(11) Accepting donations, gifts, bequests, and grants in accordance with existing laws and policy of the Department for the purpose of upgrading teachers'/learning facilitators' competencies, improving and expanding school facilities, and providing instructional materials and equipment.&nbsp; <b>Such donations or grants must be reported to the division superintendents</b>. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>We agree with petitioners' contention that, under the law, donations and grants must be reported to the appropriate district supervisors and not only to the division superintendents.&nbsp; The use in the law of the word "must" is an expression of the mandatory nature of the reporting of donations and grants to district supervisors. &nbsp;The reason for the provision is that such grants and donations which are intended to upgrade teachings/learning facilitators' competencies, improve and expand school facilities, and provide instructional materials and equipment will assist the school district supervisors in the performance of their duties and responsibilities under Section 7(D) of R.A. No. 9155, and submit appropriate recommendations to the proper administrative officers.<br><br>On petitioner's plaint of the failure of respondents to upgrade their salary grade level to at most SG 21, and for the issuance of the writ of mandamus mandating respondents to increase their salary grade from SG 19 to 24, the same is premature.<br><br>There is no showing in the petition that, before filing their petition, petitioners sought an adjustment of level of their salary grade from SG 19 to SG 21 before respondents or the Civil Service Commission. Section 17 of Presidential Decree No. 985, as amended by Section 14 of R.A. No. 6758, otherwise known as the Salary Standardization Law, provides:<blockquote>Sec. 17. <i><b>Powers and Functions</b></i>. - The Budget Commission (now Department of Budget and Management), principally through the OCPC (now CPCB, Compensation and Position Classification Board) shall, in addition to those provided under other Sections of this Decree, have the following powers and functions:<br><br>a.
