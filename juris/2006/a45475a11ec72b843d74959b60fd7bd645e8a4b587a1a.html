				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Jesus drove away the moneylenders from the temple for good reason.<br><br>These consolidated administrative matters involve employees of the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC), Regional Trial Court (RTC), Manila.&nbsp; The first, docketed as OCA IPI No. 02-1377-P was filed on 20 April 2002 by Cristeta D. Orfila (Orfila), a Process Server, charging Estifana S. Arellano (Arellano), a Human Rights Resource Management Officer II, with conduct unbecoming of a court employee.&nbsp; The second, docketed as Administrative Matter No. P-03-1692,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> concerns a countercharge filed on 26 June 2002 by Arellano and her husband, retired Judge Romulo Arellano,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> charging in turn Atty. Jesusa &nbsp;P. Maningas<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> &nbsp;and &nbsp;Atty. &nbsp;Jennifer &nbsp;C. Buendia, &nbsp;Clerk of Court and Assistant Clerk of Court, respectively, of the RTC Manila with graft and corrupt practices, etc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as well as Orfila for falsification of public document, etc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The cases were filed separately.&nbsp; On 2 April 2003, the Second Division of the Court resolved to consolidate both cases and referred them to Justice Narciso T. Atienza<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Since the parties have conflicting versions, the facts for each case as culled from the records, shall be presented and discussed separately.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Cristeta D. Orfila v. Estifana S. Arellano</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">A.M. No. P-06-2110</span><br><br>According to Orfila, at about 8:15 in the morning of 16 April 2002, she went to the office of Atty. Jesusa P.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maningas, who was then Clerk of Court of RTC Manila, to give the latter <span style="font-style: italic;">suman</span> for breakfast.&nbsp; While they were conversing, Arellano barged in and said, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Magbayad ka ng iyong utang</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; She had previously borrowed P10,000.00&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;from Arellano and the latter was demanding payment for the unpaid interest due thereon in the amount of P2,000.00.&nbsp; A heated argument ensued between them.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas advised the two women to settle the matter outside her office and urged them to respect her position.&nbsp; Then Orfila asked Arellano, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Bakit naman Panyeng ganyan ka binabastos mo ako, wag kang bastos.&nbsp; Pormalin mo ako Panyeng. Meron naman akong table sa kabila, doon mo ako puntahan at singilin.&nbsp; Huwag kung&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;saan-saan pati doon sa table ni Boy</span>,” to which Arellano retorted, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinungaling ka talaga, Tita, hindi ‘yan totoo, sinungaling ka</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At this point, Arellano suddenly slapped Orfila on her left cheek prompting Atty. Maningas to call for the help of the other employees who were seated by their table right outside the door of her office. There were only two other employees present, Glenda&nbsp; Homeres and Ernesto Lacaba.&nbsp; They later testified that they had heard the altercation, and through the glass panels of Atty. Maningas’s cubicle, witnessed the slapping incident.&nbsp; Homeres helped Orfila to sit down as she seemed about to fall while Lacaba tried to pacify Arellano who then had taken off one of her shoes and was attempting to hit Orfila with it.<br><br>Thereafter, Orfila had herself examined in the Ospital ng Maynila and was attended to by Dr. Jose&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pingol.&nbsp; Dr. Pingol issued to her a medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>diagnosing her with swelling of the left and right cheeks that could have been caused by slapping.<br><br>Atty. Buendia, the Assistant Clerk of Court, was not present when the incident took place but learned of the same through a text message she received while she was on her way to the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; When she arrived, Atty. Maningas relayed to her what she had witnessed and instructed her verbally, and through a subsequent memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> to conduct an investigation on the matter.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas inhibited herself therefrom as Arellano was her <span style="font-style: italic;">kumadre</span>, she being a principal sponsor in the wedding of one of the latter’s children.&nbsp; She also feared being accused of bias should she find for Orfila because the latter gave her <span style="font-style: italic;">suman.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On the same day of the incident, Atty. Buendia called a meeting of all section chiefs and officers as well as Arellano, wherein they were reminded to be vigilant in preventing a repetition of the same untoward incident in the office.&nbsp; After the meeting, Atty. Buendia spoke to her about the shameful incident.&nbsp; Arellano just replied, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Agi, nabigla ako. Buligi na la ako</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Later that afternoon, Judge Arellano came to their office.&nbsp; He told both Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia that he gave his wife money out of his retirement pay “<span style="font-style: italic;">para may mapaglibangan</span>” and that refusal to pay a debt was actionable under the Civil Service Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Atty. Buendia expressed her hopes that the matter between Orfila and his wife will be settled, to which he replied, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Ah oo, pepersonalin ko ito</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Orfila then arrived and Judge Arellano apologized to her.&nbsp; He asked that she forgive his wife and not to push through with filing a complaint but Orfila refused.<br><br>The Investigating Committee headed by Atty. Buendia&nbsp; interviewed Orfila, Arellano, Homeres, Lacaba and Atty. Maningas.&nbsp; They also tried to reconcile Orfila and Arellano several times but to no avail.&nbsp; According to Atty. Buendia, the parties were not represented by counsel nor were stenographic notes taken during the investigation since it was only an inter-office matter that they hoped would be settled between the parties.<br><br>On 29 April 2002, the Investigating Committee rendered a report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to Atty. Maningas that documented the slapping incident but stopped short of making any recommendation.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas endorsed the same for administrative action to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) through the Hon. Enrico A. Lanzanas, Acting Executive Judge of RTC Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> At the same time, Orfila filed the instant administrative complaint as well as a criminal complaint against Arellano for slight physical injuries, slander by deed and oral defamation with the Office of the Manila City Prosecutor.<br><br>Defending herself, Arellano decried complainant’s version of the facts as fabricated, trumped-up, malicious and intentionally filed by Orfila out of vindictiveness and for the purpose of harassment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; She claimed that the complainant obtained a P10,000.00 loan from her at 10% interest every month to be paid in three (3) months.&nbsp; When complainant defaulted, she tried to collect from her every pay day. It took Orfila years to pay a part of the principal amount and would burst into anger every time she was reminded of the unpaid balance of her loan. Arellano testified that she did not file any formal complaint against Orfila regarding her debt but only asked her husband to send her a demand letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>At 8:00 o’clock in the morning of 16 April 2002, per Arellano’s testimony, Orfila came to her office in the RTC Library, informing her that Atty. Maningas has the money for the balance of Orfila’s loan.&nbsp; She was glad because at long last Orfila was going to pay her so she went to see Atty. Maningas.&nbsp; But as soon as she entered the said office, Orfila began lambasting her saying, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Bastos ka, ayaw kong magbayad sa iyo, kung magbabayad ako dito rin kay Atty. Maningas ibibigay ko.&nbsp; Ayaw kong magbigay sa iyo, bastos ka</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> She did not say a word but just crossed her arms.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas said, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Magpasensyahan na kayo</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Orfila stood up and pointed her finger near Arellano’s face and said, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Ikaw bastos ka hindi ako magbabayad sa iyo</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Arellano pushed her and parried Orfila’s fingers with her hand.&nbsp; She denies slapping her, claiming that Orfila could have been hit by her own hand when she pushed it towards her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Arellano also tried to remove one of her shoes for self-defense, or to scare Orfila because the latter was charging towards her.<br><br>Arellano further claimed that the instant case was filed by Orfila in connivance with Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas is also indebted to her in the total amount of P15,000.00 at 10% monthly interest which she refused to pay.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas allegedly tried to convince her several times to condone her loan obligations as well as that of Orfila in exchange for Orfila’s desistance from filing a complaint against her but she flatly refused. They then conspired with Atty. Buendia to silence her by carefully planning a set-up wherein she was called to Atty. Maningas’s office under the pretext that Orfila would settle her indebtedness through her.&nbsp; They then made it appear that she had provoked the incident and Atty. Maningas could be the sole witness while Atty. Buendia would conduct the investigation.&nbsp; Arellano charged that Glenda Homeres and Ernesto Lacaba were only instructed by Atty. Maningas to testify in favor of Orfila.<br><br>Arellano testified that she did not file any complaint against Orfila, Maningas and Buendia nor report the matter to her superior or with the Executive Judge of RTC Manila.&nbsp; Nobody prevented her from doing so but she simply did not want to have any enemies for she was then retiring soon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Arellano further testified that she was interviewed &nbsp;by &nbsp;the Investigating Committee regarding the incident but she was not allowed to submit a written explanation.&nbsp; Thereafter, Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia suggested that she settle the case amicably with Orfila by giving the latter P30,000.00, which amount was later reduced to P20,000.00. However, she did not assert that she was the aggrieved party because she wanted the case to be settled before she retired.<br><br>Arellano further averred that after the slapping incident, Atty. Maningas, Atty. Buendia and Orfila started harassing her by threatening to block her retirement benefits if she did not give in to their demands.&nbsp; However, she filed an administrative complaint against them only after she received a copy of Orfila’s complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Arellano’s husband also testified in his wife’s behalf, essentially corroborating her tale.&nbsp; According to him, after his wife called him in the afternoon of 16 April 2002, he went to see Atty. Maningas to verify the facts.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas allegedly told him that no one saw Arellano slap Orfila’s face.&nbsp; Orfila even apologized to him, assuring him that it was just a simple misunderstanding between her and his wife. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sps. Romulo and Estifana Arellano v. Jesusa P. Maningas, Jennifer C. Buendia and Cristeta D. Orfila</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.M. No. P-03-1692</span><br><br>The spouses Arellano, this time as complainants, filed a joint complaint-affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> against Orfila, Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Charges Against Cristeta D. Orfila</span><br><br>The Arellanos accused Orfila of falsification of public documents by making it appear in her Service Record<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and in her Personal Data Sheet,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which she personally accomplished when she was appointed janitor in the Court of First Instance of Manila on 1 November 1982, that she was born on 8 October 1942 in Carigara, Leyte when in fact she was not.<br><br>Her marriage contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> showed that when she was married on 29 November 1956, she was already 22 years old.&nbsp; Thus, she must have been born in 1934 and should have compulsorily retired in 1999 at the age of 65.&nbsp; Similarly, the birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of her son William indicated that she was married on 29 November 1956 and she was 21 years old at the time of William’s birth in 1957.<br><br>The Arellanos further charged Orfila with the nonpayment of her loan and of conniving with Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia in harassing Arellano in order to evade payment of her obligation.&nbsp; She allegedly acted as a willing tool considering that she was extraordinarily close to them and that she owed Atty. Maningas favors, among which was the employment of her three children in RTC Manila.<br><br>Orfila denied the charges, insisting that she was born on 8 October 1942.&nbsp; Said date was what her parents had inculcated in her &nbsp;mind &nbsp;as her birthdate which she had been using in good faith ever since she can remember.&nbsp; She cannot produce her birth certificate because records of birth from 1942 to 1944 in Carigara, Leyte were destroyed during the Japanese occupation.&nbsp; She submitted her Certificate of Live Birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which was issued only on 29 July 2002 after she applied for late registration of her birth in the Office of the Civil Registrar of Carigara, Leyte.&nbsp; The information appearing therein were all furnished by respondent herself and her daughter, Maria Teresa Castel.&nbsp; It indicated 1942 as the year of her birth.<br><br>Orfila further claimed that her marriage with her husband was arranged by her parents.&nbsp; When she signed the marriage contract, she did not know that her age as stated therein was 22 years old.&nbsp; She was only asked by her father to sign the document and she did not know what she was signing then.&nbsp; Neither could she remember how old she was because she was still very young then.&nbsp; She had just enrolled in Grade II and she cannot read but can only write her name.<br><br>According to Orfila, she has nothing but a simple superior-subordinate relationship with Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia.&nbsp; She denied that they framed up Arellano.&nbsp; She filed a case against Arellano of her own volition because the latter had slapped her.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Charges Against Atty. (now Judge) Jesusa P. Maningas</span><br><br>Meanwhile, complainants-spouses charged Atty. Maningas with graft and corrupt practices, illegal and immoral abuse of official position, gross misconduct, immoral solicitation and nonpayment of loans, betrayal of public trust, illegal solicitation of money, oppression, coercion, maliciously and deliberately trying to delay, block or otherwise deprive Mrs. Arellano of her retirement benefits by filing midnight and trumped-up charges against her, in connivance with Atty. Buendia and Orfila, and dishonesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Arellano admitted that after her husband got his retirement gratuity, she extended loans to people in the office who requested for one.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas allegedly pleaded with Arellano to allow her a loan of P30,000.00.&nbsp; Arellano was then a subordinate employee of Atty. Maningas in the OCC.&nbsp; At first, Arellano refused but after consulting her husband, Arellano agreed to lend her P10,000.00.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas accepted the same for which she signed a receipt dated January 21, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; To avoid further disturbance, Arellano lent Atty. Maningas another P5,000.00 in February 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> They agreed that the loans were payable in three (3) months.<br><br>Yet despite several demands by Arellano, Atty. Maningas never paid the loans.&nbsp; Instead, the latter tried to sweet talk her that she would recommend her for promotion if she would condone her loans.&nbsp; When Arellano was eventually promoted as Human Resource Management Officer II, Atty. Maningas claimed that she facilitated her promotion by following it up personally and even treating the members of the Selection and Promotion Board of the Supreme Court to snacks.<br><br>Arellano testified that she did not file any action against Atty. Maningas out of respect and she just hoped that she would be paid.&nbsp; Neither did she send her any demand letter.&nbsp; It was only when she was about to retire in May 2002 that she informed her husband of Atty. Maningas’s refusal to pay.<br><br>The Arellanos further alleged that it was “<span style="font-style: italic;">usap-usapan</span>” in the RTC Manila that Atty. Maningas and Atty. Buendia were involved in the anomalous re-raffle of certain criminal cases. They also allegedly created their own screening committee for accepting employment in the OCC.<br><br>Rebutting these charges, Atty. Maningas claimed that in January 1999, she learned from a fellow employee that Arellano was granting loans at a very low interest rate.&nbsp; She approached Arellano who offered her a loan.&nbsp; Atty. Maningas admitted procuring two (2) loans totaling P15,000.00 at P500.00 monthly interest per P10,000.00 increment of the principal amount, payable in six (6) installments.&nbsp; The installments, interest and period covered were stated in Arellano’s notebook which Atty. Maningas signs every time she pays.&nbsp; At the beginning, she kept a list<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of her own but she discontinued the same because she trusted Arellano.&nbsp; No oral or written demand was ever made to her by Arellano.&nbsp; On the day of the slapping incident, she even reminded Judge &nbsp;&nbsp;Arellano of the fact that she had paid her debt and the latter did not correct her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Atty. Maningas further testified that in 2002 she requested for a moratorium from paying the loan which Arellano granted. Upon approval of her SCSLA loan in February 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> she paid Arellano the balance of her loan which was more or less P4,000.00 in the presence of some female employees in the library, namely: Editha Gochingco and Lenida Cariño.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; After Arellano received the same, she said, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Naku matutuwa si Judge nito</span>,” to which Atty. Maningas replied, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Wala ba akong diploma comadre</span>?”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; But Mrs. Arellano answered, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Wala na ma’am, ok na ito</span>.”&nbsp; She no longer insisted on getting a receipt because it would be a sign of mistrust.&nbsp; Furthermore, Arellano had the habit of not issuing any receipt upon full payment of loans by borrowers.&nbsp; She admitted lending money to Laniel Jornada, a co-employee, and not issuing a receipt when he paid her.&nbsp; She simply recorded his payments in her notebook.<br><br>Atty. Maningas also denied having any knowledge of Orfila’s age.&nbsp; According to her, there were more than 100 personnel in their office and they cannot be expected to go over each of their biodata. Neither did she have anything to do with Orfila’s employment with the RTC Manila nor with her children’s. Orfila was recommended by then Executive Judge Salvador and her children were recommended by their respective judges. Atty. Maningas likewise denied having a hand in Arellano’s promotion.&nbsp; Arellano was promoted in 2001 to the position of Human Resource Management Officer II because she was the lone applicant and she was recommended by then Executive Judge Guarina.<br><br>As regards the alleged anomaly in the re-raffle of cases, Atty. Maningas explained that the case of “People v. Jose Sy y Ang,” on which the disturbing rumors had centered, was added to the cases calendared for raffle on 28 February 2000.&nbsp; She had no participation in the preparation of the calendar.&nbsp; She tendered her resignation from the raffle committee out of <span style="font-style: italic;">delicadeza</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Her resignation was not accepted.<br><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Charges Against Atty. Jennifer C. Buendia</span><br><br>Complainants-spouses hurled similar charges of conspiracy, corruption and abuse of position against Atty. Buendia.&nbsp; In addition, Atty. Buendia is popularly known to have the habit of throwing sumptuous birthday parties in the Office of the Clerk of Court.&nbsp; During her birthday party on 12 April 2002, an abundant supply of food was on the table.&nbsp; One of the several <span style="font-style: italic;">litsons</span> had a tag on which was written, “<span style="font-style: italic;">To Atty. Buendia, happy birthday</span>” from a certain bonding company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Atty. Buendia denied framing up Arellano as earlier mentioned.&nbsp; She did not even know that Atty. Maningas borrowed money from Arellano.&nbsp; She found out about it only when Atty. Maningas excused herself one day and informed her that she was going to the library to pay Arellano the balance of her loan.&nbsp; When she came back, she happily announced, “<span style="font-style: italic;">Graduate na ako, la na ako utang kay Estifania</span>.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Atty. Maningas had bought fried chicken for their lunch that day because she was finally able to encash her loan check from the SCSLA.<br><br>Atty. Buendia denied harassing or threatening Mrs. Arellano into paying Mrs. Orfila P30,000.00.&nbsp; She admitted exerting efforts to reconcile the two but Orfila’s children objected to their mother acceding to any settlement.&nbsp; According to them, the only acceptable settlement was for their mother to also slap Mrs. Arellano.<br><br>Atty. Buendia also denied throwing a birthday bash on 12 April 2002, claiming that the lunch in question was a potluck organized by the April birthday celebrants in the OCC, herself included.&nbsp; Atty. Buendia likewise disavowed having knowledge of Orfila’s age and the circumstances of her employment as well as that of her children.&nbsp; She opined that she has no power to appoint people to government position. She also denied blocking Arellano’s retirement benefits and argued that she and Atty. Maningas would gain nothing by doing so.<br><br>As regards the alleged rigging of the raffle of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ang Sy</span> case, Atty. Buendia claimed that she was not forced to resign from the raffle committee.&nbsp; She tendered her resignation out of <span style="font-style: italic;">delicadeza</span> and no charges were filed against her regarding the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Judge Arellano also testified to support his wife’s charges.&nbsp; He asserted that he did not apologize to Orfila.&nbsp; He also testified that he did not respond when Atty. Maningas told him that she had already paid her debt because he felt amused by her remark knowing that she had not yet settled her loan obligations with his wife. He did not take any legal action to demand payment from Atty. Maningas because he did not want his wife to encounter any problem when she retires. He likewise stated that he and his wife talked to Gochingco in the RTC library sometime in September 2002.&nbsp; She allegedly told them that she was pressured by Atty. Maningas to execute a joint-affidavit with Cariño and that she promised them a promotion if they would testify in favor of Atty. Maningas.&nbsp; But he no longer confronted her on the matter when she testified at the hearing because it was enough that it was put on record that Atty. Maningas went to her and requested that she execute a joint affidavit with Cariño in her favor.&nbsp; He also submitted a photocopy of a letter addressed to Hon. Presbitero J. Velasco, Court Administrator, purportedly written by Atty. Rolando Alejandro Q. Agustin of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas charging Atty. Buendia, <span style="font-style: italic;">et. al.</span> with alleged gross violation of laws and conduct prejudicial to the interest of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>During the course of the investigation, Mrs. Orfila passed away.&nbsp; In a letter dated 09 January 2004, Mrs. Orfila’s daughter, Mrs. Winefreda O. Paas informed the OCA of her mother’s death on 12 December 2003, together with corroborating documents.<br><br>After the investigation, Justice Atienza submitted his consolidated report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> to the OCA on 7 June 2004.&nbsp; Said report was noted by this Court on 9 August 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The OCA through Justice Atienza made the following recommendations:<br><blockquote><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IPI No. 1377-P</span> </span>[A.M.

Maningas after starting a heated argument regarding an unpaid loan.&nbsp; Orfila categorically and unwaiveringly testified that Arellano slapped her in the presence of Atty. Maningas.&nbsp; The medical certificate issued to her by Dr. Pingol confirms that she sustained injury as a result thereof.&nbsp; Her testimony was further corroborated by three eyewitnesses to whom Arellano failed to impute evil motive. In the absence of evil motive, their testimonies should be given full weight and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.

Buendia rendered a distorted report on the investigation as there were two other employees designated as members of the Investigating Committee who participated actively during the entire investigation.&nbsp; Arellano did not take legal action against either of them.&nbsp; To say that the investigation was staged would be stretching it too far.<br><br>The testimony of her husband, Judge Arellano, is bereft of evidentiary value being mere hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; His knowledge of the incident came from his alleged conversations with Atty.

Maningas,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> while Orfila and her witnesses did not waiver in their testimony.<br><br>It is highly probable that Arellano, after consultation with her husband, panicked for fear of losing her retirement benefits because of her own mischief.&nbsp; Believing that offense is the best defense, they turned the tables on the complainant and even implicated her superiors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> If there was anyone who manufactured a tall tale, it was she.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arellano then filed an administrative case against the three with her husband, a retired RTC judge, as co-complainant in order to lend credence to her story.<br><br>Arellano lays emphasis on her clean record and long faithful service in the judiciary. However, her act of slapping Orfila without proof of sufficient provocation and in the presence of her superior in the latter’s office during working hours falls short of the standard of conduct required of court employees.&nbsp; We ruled in <span style="font-style: italic;">Baloloy v. Flores</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>The conduct and behavior of everyone connected with the office charged with the administration of justice must at all times be characterized by propriety and decorum.&nbsp; The court will not tolerate misconduct committed by court personnel, particularly during office hours within the premises of the court. Such misconduct shows lack of respect for the court, and erodes the good image of the judiciary in the eyes of the public.<br></blockquote>Although the slapping may not be work-related, the brazenness of her act is totally unacceptable and should not be countenanced.&nbsp; As enunciated by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Zenaida C.
