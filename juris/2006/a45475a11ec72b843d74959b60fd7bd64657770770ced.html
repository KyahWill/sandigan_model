				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 60085 affirming on appeal the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Quezon City, Branch 105, in Civil Case No. Q-91-10576.<br><br>JMA House Incorporated (JMA) applied for a <strike>P</strike>1,500,000.00 loan from the Pioneer Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (Pioneer).  To secure payment thereof, JMA executed a real estate mortgage over a parcel of land identified as Lot No. 4, Block No. 13, Subdivision Plan No. Psd-35337 covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 268126. The lot, which was located in Quezon City across Gate 1 of the Maryknoll College, had an area of 1,611.6 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> There was likewise a three-storey commercial and residential building which was occupied by tenants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Upon the failure of JMA to pay its loan, the real estate mortgage was foreclosed extrajudicially.  Pioneer was the winning bidder at <strike>P</strike>2,000,000.00 during the sale at public auction held on August 26, 1985.  The Sheriff executed a Certificate of Sale over the property in favor of Pioneer which was annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 268126 on October 11, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  JMA had one year or until October 11, 1986 to redeem the property. <br><br>JMA decided to redeem the property from Pioneer sometime in June 1986. It offered to borrow from Sta. Monica Industrial and Development Corporation (Sta. Monica) the amount of <strike>P</strike>2,300,000.00. During the negotiations between Rosita Alberto, the General Manager of JMA, and Sta. Monica's president Eugenio Trinidad, the parties agreed that the latter would purchase the property for <strike>P</strike>3,021,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Trinidad insisted that JMA execute a deed of absolute sale over the property for the price of <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00.  Rosita Alberto suggested that instead of a deed of absolute sale, a real estate mortgage be executed considering that the property was worth much more than <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00. Trinidad refused. By way of a compromise, Alberto suggested that a supplement deed giving JMA the option to repurchase the property within a period of two years be executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Trinidad agreed to this proposal. Thus, the lawyers of JMA and Sta. Monica prepared two deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> From the <strike>P</strike>3,021,000.00 it received from Sta. Monica, JMA remitted <strike>P</strike>2,300,000.00 to Pioneer.<br><br>On June 23, 1986, Pioneer and JMA executed a Deed of Legal Redemption and Absolute Sale in which Pioneer, for and consideration of <strike>P</strike>2,300,000.00, transferred to JMA all the rights over the property, including the improvements thereon, which Pioneer acquired under the Certificate of Sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  The parties, likewise, declared therein that it was their intention that, with the execution of said deed, the loan of JMA amounting to <strike>P</strike>1,250,000.00, including all interests, penalties and charges thereon, were considered fully paid and legally extinguished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br>On June 30, 1986 JMA, represented by its General Manager Rosita Alberto, executed a <i>Deed of Absolute Sale</i> over the lot, including the buildings thereon, in favor of Sta. Monica, represented by Eugenio Trinidad. The receipt for <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00 as purchase price was acknowledged by JMA from Sta. Monica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> As agreed upon by the parties, the parties likewise executed a contract denominated as Option to Buy, in which Sta. Monica gave JMA the option to buy the property for P4,100,000.00 within one (1) year from the execution of the Deed Of Absolute Sale on or before July 1, 1987, with a "grace period" of one year immediately upon the expiration thereof (until July 1, 1988). The parties agreed that, in case JMA availed of such extension, JMA would be obligated to pay an additional amount equivalent to 3.5% a month as liquidated damages, until the whole amount is fully paid and/or the option is finally exercised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br>Alberto turned over to Trinidad the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 26812.6 The Register of Deeds thereafter issued TCT No. 347638 in the name of Sta. Monica;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> however, the Option to Buy was not annotated at the dorsal portion of the title. <br><br>As agreed upon between JMA and Sta. Monica, the latter thenceforth paid the realty taxes on the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  JMA continued collecting the rentals from the tenants of the buildings with the knowledge and conformity of Sta. Monica.  On November 17, 1986, Sta. Monica mortgaged the property to the PCI Capital Corporation as security for a <strike>P</strike>3,600,000.00 loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  <br><br>In a letter dated January 26, 1988, Sta. Monica, through Eugenio Trinidad, informed Rosita Alberto and the tenants of the buildings in the property that due to the failure of JMA to "repurchase" the property, it had been sold to A. Guerrero Development Corporation (AGCOR) effective February 1, 1988, and, as the new owner, AGCOR would be collecting the rentals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rosita Alberto protested to Trinidad, insisting that the period given to JMA to buy back the property had not yet elapsed.  Nevertheless, on February 2, 1988, Sta. Monica and AGCOR executed a Deed of Absolute Sale over the property for <strike>P</strike>5,700,000.00, receipt of which was acknowledged by Sta. Monica.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Part of the amount was used by Sta. Monica to redeem the property from PCI Capital Corporation which executed a Release of Real Estate Mortgage on February 16, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On February 17, 1988, the Register of Deeds issued TCT No. 376746 in the name of AGCOR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It paid the realty taxes on the property starting 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Despite the sale of the property to AGCOR, Trinidad received, on June 30, 1988, five checks from Rosita Alberto drawn against the account of JMA in the total amount of <strike>P</strike>3,000,000.00. He likewise received <strike>P</strike>57,000.00 from Atty. Rosalie Alberto, Rosita's sister and a member of the JMA Board of Directors "as partial payment of the account of JMA for the property located at No. 335, Katipunan Street, Quezon City."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  However, the checks were dishonored by the drawee Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Trinidad failed to return the cash amount of <strike>P</strike>57,000.00 to JMA.<br><br>On October 30, 1989, AGCOR mortgaged the property to Planter's Development Bank as security for a <strike>P</strike>7,000,000.00 loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Almost two years thereafter, or on November 11, 1991, JMA filed a complaint against Sta. Monica and AGCOR, as defendants, in the RTC of Quezon City for specific performance, reconveyance and damages. It alleged that it mortgaged its property to Sta. Monica as security for a <strike>P</strike>3,021,000.00 loan and <strike>P</strike>1,079,000.00 as interest; however, upon the insistence of Trinidad, in lieu of a real estate mortgage, a deed of absolute sale was executed over the property for the price of <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00; an Option to Buy was also executed in its favor, giving it the option to buy the property for <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00 within a period of one (1) year  from execution thereof, and in the meantime, it retained dominion over the property; on January 26, 1988, it received notice that beginning February 1, 1988, the tenants will pay their rentals to the new owner of the property, defendant AGCOR, to which it protested; defendant Sta. Monica assured the plaintiff that defendant AGCOR was aware of its option to buy the property. <br><br>JMA further alleged that it informed defendant Sta. Monica on June 30, 1988 that it was ready to repurchase the property for <strike>P</strike>5,822,000.00 with an initial payment of <strike>P</strike>3,057,000.00 to be immediately tendered on said date, and the remaining balance of <strike>P</strike>2,765,000.00 after one month. Sta. Monica assured JMA that the property would be delivered to it with AGCOR's conformity. JMA paid <strike>P</strike>3,057,000.00 on June 30, 1988, per redemption receipt issued by Trinidad, who however refused to receive the balance. Despite representations to defendant AGCOR to abide by the Option to Buy, AGCOR maintained its right to possess and own the property and even filed ejectment cases against it; worse, Sta. Monica never returned the downpayment given on June 30, 1988 and continues to benefit therefrom.<br><br>JMA averred that it had a right to repurchase the property under the terms of the Option to Buy Agreement dated June 30, 1986, considering that the transaction actually entered into is one of equitable mortgage and not a deed of sale with option to buy. Defendant Sta. Monica is mandated by law to abide by the said agreement and could not have sold the questioned property to defendant AGCOR, taking into account that it has accepted the amount of <strike>P</strike>3,057,000.00 as downpayment for the purchase price. Having sold the property to AGCOR, defendant Sta. Monica must be made to pay the plaintiff the amount of <strike>P</strike>15,000,000.00 which is the actual market value of the property, as well as the rental payments which it failed to collect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The plaintiff prayed that judgment be rendered in its favor, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff ordering:<br><br>1) Defendants Sta. Monica and AGCOR to respect and acknowledge the right of JMA to repurchase and consequently own and possess the property free from liens and all encumbrances;<br><br>2) Defendants to solidarily pay the plaintiff the accrued rentals of <strike>P</strike>2,362,500.00 as of October 1991, with an additional <strike>P</strike>52,500.00 every month thereafter until defendant AGCOR ceases to collect the mentioned rentals from the tenants of the premises;<br><br>3) Ordering defendants to pay exemplary damages in the amount of <strike>P</strike>100,000.00, nominal damages in the amount of <strike>P</strike>100,000.00, attorney's fees in the sum of <strike>P</strike>200,000.00 and the costs of suit;<br><br>Just and equitable reliefs are, likewise, prayed for under the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>For its part, Sta. Monica alleged in its Answer to the complaint the following special and affirmative defenses: (1) JMA has no cause of action against it; (2) the complaint is unfounded and malicious; (3) it acted in good faith; (4) the supposed "Option to Buy" is not supported by valuable consideration and, therefore, is unenforceable; (5) assuming arguendo that there was an extension to exercise the said "Option to Buy," it was not in writing, without consideration and, therefore, unenforceable; (6) the amount/s which JMA had given to it had been offset by the value of the property and the resulting damages sustained by it (Sta. Monica). Defendant claimed <strike>P</strike>1,000,000.00, <strike>P</strike>500,000.00, P200,000.00 and <strike>P</strike>100,000.00 compulsory counterclaim representing actual, moral and exemplary damages, including attorney's fees and the litigation expenses, respectively. <br><br>Defendant AGCOR alleged in its Answer with Cross-claim and Counterclaims that the physical possession of the subject property was voluntarily surrendered by Sta. Monica to it upon execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale. It came to know of the alleged "Option to Buy" only on September 30, 1988 when Trinidad made an offer to repurchase the subject property with an initial downpayment of <strike>P</strike>3,000,000.00, the balance to be paid on the following day. However, Trinidad never showed up or called as promised.<br><br>As special and affirmative defenses, it claimed that there was no cause of action against it, since even assuming that an option to buy was duly executed, it was not a party thereto. It pointed out that the option was not registered nor annotated in the title with the Register of Deeds for the purpose of giving notice to the whole world; JMA was estopped from claiming that its contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> with Sta. Monica was a sale with right to repurchase, considering that there was no pre-existing condition or limitation whatsoever to serve as notice to third persons dealing with the said property; it was a purchaser in good faith without knowledge of any agreement between JMA and Sta. Monica or any fact that would vitiate consent in the acquisition of the property; it acquired legal title thru sale and in fact, TCT No. 376746 was issued in its name; and JMA is guilty of laches and it had not completely exercised its option to repurchase by paying the total amount and there is no proof that the option was extended by Sta. Monica for another year.<br><br>By way of cross-claim, AGCOR alleged that JMA and Sta. Monica should be the only parties in this case, since they executed the "Option to Buy," to its exclusion.  Because of its inclusion as defendant, its goodwill was damaged and it was deprived of its right of full ownership; thus, cross-defendant Sta. Monica should be held liable for actual or compensatory damages in the amount of <strike>P</strike>1,000,000.00. It likewise asserted compulsory counterclaims in the amount of <strike>P</strike>500,000.00 as moral damages, P300,000.00 as exemplary damages, and <strike>P</strike>200,000.00 as attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 1992, Eugenio Trinidad died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Victor Trinidad became the President of Sta. Monica.<br><br>During trial, JMA presented Rosita Alberto and her sister, Atty. Rosalie Alberto as witnesses. Rosita testified that she graduated from the University of the Philippines with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It was Eugenio Trinidad who insisted that JMA execute a deed of absolute sale instead of a real estate mortgage to secure the <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00 loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> She, in turn, requested that an option to buy be executed by the plaintiff to supplement the deed of absolute sale to which Trinidad agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> JMA retained possession of the property and continued collecting rentals from the tenants since the transaction between the parties was precisely a contract of mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> When she protested to Trinidad's letter dated January 26, 1988 informing her and the tenants that the property had not been repurchased by JMA, Trinidad verbally assured her that JMA could repurchase the property and pay the price thereof within a reasonable time. Trinidad agreed to the repurchasing of the property for <strike>P</strike>5,822,000.00 payable in two installments, to wit: (a) <strike>P</strike>3,057,000.00 on June 30, 1988; and (b) the balance of <strike>P</strike>2,768,000.00 within a reasonable time. On June 30, 1988, <strike>P</strike>3,000,000.00  in checks and <strike>P</strike>57,000.00 cash was paid by JMA, through Atty. Rosalie Alberto and Atty. Rellosa to Trinidad, and for which the latter issued a redemption receipt. JMA was ready to pay the balance of the repurchase price (<strike>P</strike>2,768,000.00) but Trinidad could not be located, and worse, failed to return the initial amount paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Rosita Alberto admitted that her agreement with Trinidad, that JMA can repurchase the property by paying the price within a reasonable time, was merely verbal because she trusted Trinidad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  JMA did not file any complaint for consignation of the amount for its repurchase of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She admitted that the checks delivered to Trinidad had been dishonored.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The respective lawyers of Sta. Monica and JMA typed the deed of absolute sale and option to buy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Atty. Rosalie Alberto testified that JMA is a family corporation.  She learned of the deed of absolute sale and option to buy only in February 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> She represented JMA in the negotiations with Trinidad for the repurchase of the property.  Trinidad informed her that he had already informed defendant AGCOR of plaintiff's tender of <strike>P</strike>3,057,000.00.  He, however, suggested that she personally inform AGCOR of said tender.  When she did so, Guerrero informed her that AGCOR could no longer accept the offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> She wanted to tell Trinidad about what Guerrero had said, but she could no longer locate him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <br><br>Franco Marquez, President of the Philippine Appraisal Co., Inc., testified that the property was appraised on May 15, 1986, and its value was pegged at <strike>P</strike>11,080,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Defendant Sta. Monica presented its president, Victor Trinidad, who testified on the damages sustained by it. On cross-examination, he admitted that, despite the deed of absolute sale, it never took possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Neither did defendant collect rentals from the tenants of the building because of the option to buy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Alberto Guerrero, a doctor of medicine and a lawyer, testified that he was the president of AGCOR, also a family corporation.  When the property was offered for sale by Sta. Monica, he examined the title in the Register of Deeds and discovered that it was mortgaged to PCI Capital Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> He agreed to buy the property and paid Sta. Monica's loan on February 3 and 16, 1988, upon which a Release of Real Estate Mortgage was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In due course, defendants AGCOR and Sta. Monica executed a Deed of Absolute Sale covering the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> He further declared that AGCOR secured a <strike>P</strike>2,500,000.00 loan from Planter's Bank and used the money to pay Sta. Monica.  On October 30, 1989, Sta. Monica executed a real estate mortgage over the property in favor of Planter's Bank as security for a <strike>P</strike>7,000,000.00 loan. The deed was annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT No. 376746 on November 15, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The property was declared for taxation purposes after the property had been purchased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On January 26, 1996, JMA filed an Omnibus Motion to Admit Newly-Discovered Evidence, which included the Appraisal Report of the Philippine Appraisal Co., Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> to prove the fair market value of the property as of February 1, 1988. The RTC granted the motion and allowed Franco M. Marquez to testify on the Appraisal Report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The plaintiff offered the Report as part of the motion and to prove that the appraisal value of the property in May 1986 was P11,080,000.00. The report was admitted as part of the testimony of Marquez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On December 8, 1997, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendants.  It ordered the dismissal of the complaint and ordered the plaintiff to pay <strike>P</strike>50,000.00 to each of the defendants.  The fallo of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Court renders judgment as follows:<br><ol><li>Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed and it is ordered on the counterclaim, to pay the amount of <strike>P</strike>50,000.00 each to defendant Sta. Monica Industrial &amp; Development Corporation and defendant A. Guerrero Development Corporation as attorney's fees; and to pay the costs of suit;<br><br></li><li>The cross-claim of A. Guerrero Development Corporation against Sta. Monica Industrial and Development Corporation is dismissed.</li></ol>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court disbelieved the testimony of Atty. Alberto, holding that to declare the transaction between the plaintiff and defendant Sta. Monica as an equitable mortgage would be unjust to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The trial court noted that the plaintiff agreed to the execution of the deed of absolute sale and the option to buy; Rosita Alberto was an Economics graduate and was assisted by a lawyer. When the deed of absolute sale over the property was executed, JMA even offered to repurchase/buy the property instead of redeeming it, and waited up to June 30, 1988 to tender the repurchase price. The RTC concluded that the true intention of the parties was the property to be sold to Sta. Monica for profit, with JMA retaining the option to buy it back for <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00 within a specific period of time. Moreover, considering that JMA failed to file an action for reformation of deed, it was estopped from claiming that the deed of absolute sale and option to buy failed to reflect the true intention of the parties.  <br><br>The RTC ruled that the Appraisal Report had no probative weight because the property subject thereof was covered by TCT No. 20416, not the property covered by TCT No. 268216 which was the subject of the contract between the plaintiff and defendant Sta. Monica. Further, the remittances made to Trinidad by way of checks did not buttress the case for JMA because they were so remitted after the stipulated one-year period and was short of the agreed amount of <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00. It was further pointed out that the checks bounced.<br><br>The RTC also declared that before AGCOR bought the property, it had no knowledge of the option to buy executed by JMA and Sta. Monica; and even if it had, JMA had failed to exercise its option and pay the purchase price of the property within the stipulated period. It was further stated that there is no evidence to prove the supposed obligation of Sta. Monica to return the amount of <strike>P</strike>57,000.00 received by Trinidad on June 30, 1988; there is no evidence that he was authorized by Sta. Monica to do so and that he received the amount for and in its behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>JMA appealed the decision to the CA. On January 28, 2002, the appellate court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the RTC, holding that the contracts entered into by the parties are what they purport to be: a Deed of Absolute Sale and Option to Buy; the deeds were notarized, hence, are public documents, and have the presumption of regularity. Furthermore, there were no ambiguities in the deeds. It was further held that JMA was barred by laches to enforce its claim that the deed of absolute sale was in fact an equitable mortgage. It pointed out that the property was not repurchased within the timeline fixed in the Option to Buy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>    <br><br>JMA filed a motion for the reconsideration of the decision which the CA denied on July 1, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>JMA, now petitioner, filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, seeking to reverse the ruling of the CA on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT APPLYING ARTICLE 1602 OF THE CIVIL CODE AND NOT HOLDING THAT THE CONTRACT SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INSTANT PETITION IS THAT OF AN EQUITABLE MORTGAGE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER IS GUILTY OF LACHES IN ASSERTING ITS RIGHT OVER ITS PROPERTY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN UPHOLDING THE FINDING OF THE LOWER COURT THAT RESPONDENT AGCOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OPTION TO BUY.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>It maintains that the trial court and the CA failed to consider the testimony of its General Manager Rosita Alberto, to prove that the contract entered into between it and respondent Sta. Monica is, in reality, a real estate mortgage. Petitioner maintains that the trial court and the appellate court ignored the facts based on the following evidence: (1) petitioner was in dire need of money when it executed the Deed of Absolute Sale and Option to Buy on June 30, 1985; (2) it continued to possess the property after the execution of the Deed of Sale and Option to Buy, and even collected the rentals from the tenants of the commercial and residential buildings; (3) the purchase price of <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00 is grossly inadequate as purchase price of the property compared to its market value (<strike>P</strike>11,080,000.00) as found by the Philippine Appraisal Company. <br><br>On the other hand, respondents aver that the issues raised by the petitioner are factual, which the Court is proscribed from reviewing.  Moreover, the findings of facts of the trial court were affirmed by the CA; hence, such findings are conclusive on this Court. They insist that the CA decision is in accord with the law and the evidence on record.  Article 1602 of the New Civil Code does not apply in this case because petitioner failed to exercise its option and pay the agreed upon repurchase price; hence, the CA correctly ruled that it was barred by laches when it filed its complaint below only on November 11, 1991.<br><br>The threshold issues are the following: (1) whether the Court is proscribed from reviewing the factual issues raised by petitioner; (2) whether the transaction between the parties is an equitable mortgage; (3) whether the petitioner is barred by laches from filing the action against the respondent; and (4) whether respondent AGCOR was in good faith when it purchased the property from respondent Sta.

The trial court's findings, as affirmed by the CA, are conclusive on this Court unless there is preponderant evidence that the lower court ignored, misconstrued or misinterpreted cogent and substantial facts and circumstances which, if considered, would modify or reverse the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The Court may look into and resolve factual issues in exceptional cases such as when the findings and conclusions of the trial court are contrary to evidence on record or tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>On the second issue, the law is that if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> When the language of the contract is explicit, leaving no doubt as to the intention of the drafters, the courts may not read into it any other intention that would contradict its plain import.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The clear terms of the contract should never be the subject matter of interpretation.

While Trinidad insisted on a deed of absolute sale, Rosita Alberto suggested that a real estate mortgage be executed by the parties instead.  Trinidad rejected this, upon which Rosita proposed that an option to buy be executed as a supplement to the deed of absolute sale, to which Trinidad readily agreed.

Petitioner would then be able to generate funds for the purchase of the property on or before June 30, 1987 or 1988, partly from the rentals. On the other hand, respondent Sta. Monica was able to generate funds from its loan, with the property as collateral, for its business.  Both parties benefited under the arrangement.<br><br>While it is true that per Appraisal Report of the Philippine Appraisal Corporation, the property of the petitioner had a value, as of 1986, of <strike>P</strike>11,080,000.00, despite which, Alberto agreed to sell the property for <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00 under the Deed of Absolute Sale, nevertheless, Alberto cannot be faulted.  After all, under the Option to Buy, petitioner was obliged to pay only <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00.<br><br>It must be stressed that an option is a continuing offer or contract by which an owner stipulates with another that the latter shall have the right to buy the property at a fixed price with a certain time, or under, or in compliance with, certain terms and conditions; or which gives to the owner of the property the right to sell or demand a sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> It is, in fine, an unaccepted offer, governed by the second paragraph of Article 1479 of the New Civil Code which states that <i>"a promise to buy and sell a determinate thing for a price certain is reciprocally demandable."</i> An option is not of itself a purchase, but merely secures the privilege to buy. An option is a privilege given by the owner of the property to another to buy the property at his election, and the owner does not sell the property but gives another the right to buy at his election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> It imposes no binding obligation on the person holding the option, aside from the consideration for the offer. Without acceptance, it is not, properly speaking, treated as a contract, and does not vest, transfer or agree to transfer, any title to, or any interest or right in the subject property, but is merely a contract by which the owner of the property gives the optionee the right or privilege of accepting the offer and buying the property on certain terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Thus, an option contract involves two distinct elements, that is: (1) the offer to sell, which does not become a contract until accepted; (2) the completed contract to lease the offer for a specified time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> It is a separate and distinct contract from that which the parties may enter into, upon the consummation of the option. <br><br>It bears stressing that an option must be supported by a consideration distinct and separate from the price.  A consideration for an optional contract is just as important as the consideration for any other kind of contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> If there is no consideration for the optional contract, then it cannot be enforced anymore than any other contract where no consideration exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> However, case law is that although an option is not binding as a contract for want of consideration, yet if the offer contained therein is not withdrawn, its acceptance within the time limited gives rise to a contract of sale, binding on the vendor, which cannot be affected by any subsequent attempt to withdraw the offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>The optionee or promisee is burdened to prove such consideration for the option.  The consideration for the option is not presumed.  In <i>Villamor v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the Court ruled that consideration is "the why of the contract, the essential reason which moves the contracting parties to enter into the contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The consideration for a contract, including an option, need not be money or anything of monetary value but may consist of either a benefit or a detriment to the promisor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> There is sufficient consideration for a promise if there is any benefit to the promisee or any detriment to the promisor. A benefit should not necessarily accrue to the promisee if a detriment to the promisor is present; and there is consideration if the promisee does anything legal which he is not bound to do or refrain from doing anything which he has a right to do, whether or not there is any actual loan or detriment to him or actual benefit to the promisor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> It is sufficient that something valuable flows from the person to whom it is made, or that he suffers some prejudice or inconvenience, and that the promise is the inducement to the transaction. Indeed, there is a consideration if the promisee, in return for the promise, does anything legal which he is not bound to do, or refrains from doing anything which he has a right to do, whether there is any actual loss or detriment to him or actual benefit to the promisor or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>We agree with the rulings of the trial court and the CA that the option granted to the petitioner has a consideration distinct from the purchase price of the property for <strike>P</strike>4,100,000.00.<br><br>As gleaned from the Option to Buy itself, the agreement was executed by the parties because of the Deed of Absolute Sale they had executed on the same occasion.  Instead of the parties executing a Real Estate Mortgage as suggested by petitioner, the parties, by way of compromise, agreed to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale, on the condition that they execute an Option to Buy, giving petitioner the privilege to repurchase the property within a period of one year, with a grace period of one year immediately upon the expiration of the original one year period. As admitted by Rosita Alberto, the two deeds complemented each other, the Option to Buy being a supplement to the Deed of Absolute Sale.  In fine, petitioner would not have agreed to sell the property to respondent Sta. Monica unless petitioner was given the option to repurchase the property for the same amount.<br><br>However, we agree with the ruling of the CA that petitioner failed to exercise its option and notify respondent Sta. Monica of its acceptance of the latter's offer within the timeline under the Option to Buy. Under the said deed, petitioner had one year from June 30, 1986 or up to June 30, 1987 to exercise its option, and in case of failure to do so, it had a one year grace period (from  July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988), provided that, in the latter case, it would pay equitable damages of 3.5% a month from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988 until full payment of the purchase price or until the option is finally exercised. The pertinent portion of the contract reads:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the foregoing premises, stipulations and conditions, the JMA HOUSE INCORPORATED is hereby given an option to buy back the subject properties mentioned in the aforesaid Deed of Absolute Sale, and in like manner the STA. MONICA INDUSTRIAL AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION hereby undertakes and binds itself to resell the same unto the said JMA HOUSE INCORPORATED within a period of One (1) year from and after date of execution of the said Deed for a fixed consideration of FOUR MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P4,100,000.00) Philippine Currency; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, should the said JMA HOUSE INCORPORATED failed (sic) to exercise the herein option to buy back within the above-stated period, the JMA HOUSE INCORPORATED be (sic) given a grace period of another One (1) year immediately thereafter.  In case of such extension the JMA HOUSE INCORPORATED hereby undertakes and binds itself to pay an amount equivalent to Three and one-half percent (sic) month for and as liquidated damages until the whole amount is fully paid and/or the option is finally exercised.<br></blockquote>It is clear that petitioner failed to exercise its option on or before June 30, 1987. Neither did petitioner exercise its option and pay the liquidated damages to respondent Sta. Monica from July 1, 1987 up to June 1988.  This impelled respondent Sta. Monica to inform petitioner that because of its failure to exercise its option to purchase the property, it had to discontinue collecting the rentals from the tenants of the buildings. On February 2, 1988, respondent Sta. Monica sold the property to respondent AGCOR, which secured TCT No. 376746 on February 17, 1988. <br><br>The Option to Buy provides that acceptance must be accompanied by payment of liquidated damages; such payment is a condition precedent to the exercise of the right to buy, and the money must be tendered or offered.  A mere notice of an intention to accept, or of an acceptance without such payment or tender, does not constitute a valid compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Respondent Sta. Monica's acceptance of the five checks in the total amount of <strike>P</strike>3,000,000.00 and the cash amount of <strike>P</strike>57,000.00 on June 30, 1988, as partial payment of petitioner's account did not resuscitate the right which petitioner had by then already lost, particularly since the property had already been sold and titled to AGCOR. The said partial payment was an exercise in futility, made worse by the fact that the five checks were dishonored by the drawee bank.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
