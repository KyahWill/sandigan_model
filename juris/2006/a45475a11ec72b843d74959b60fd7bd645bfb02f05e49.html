				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for review on certiorari, petitioners seek to reinstate the May 11, 1990 decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 55,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;">[4]</span></sup><span style="font-weight: normal;"> in SP Case No. 97668, which was reversed and set aside by the Court of Appeals in its decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;">[5]</sup><span style="font-weight: normal;"> dated October 24, 2002.</span><br>
 <br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">FACTS OF THE CASE</span><br></div> <br>This case concerns the settlement of the intestate estates of Guillermo Rustia and Josefa Delgado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The main issue in this case is relatively simple: who, between petitioners and respondents, are the lawful heirs of the decedents.  However, it is attended by several collateral issues that complicate its resolution.  <br> <br>The claimants to the estates of Guillermo Rustia and Josefa Delgado may be divided into two groups: (1) the alleged heirs of Josefa Delgado, consisting of her half- and full-blood siblings, nephews and nieces, and grandnephews and grandnieces, and (2) the alleged heirs of Guillermo Rustia, particularly, his sisters,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> his nephews and nieces,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> his illegitimate child,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> adopted child<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</span></sup> (ampun-ampunan) of the decedents.<br> <br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ALLEGED HEIRS OF JOSEFA DELGADO</span><br></div> <br>The deceased Josefa Delgado was the daughter of Felisa<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Delgado by one Lucio Campo.  Aside from Josefa, five other children were born to the couple, namely, Nazario, Edilberta, Jose, Jacoba, and Gorgonio, all surnamed Delgado.  Felisa Delgado was never married to Lucio Campo, hence, Josefa and her full-blood siblings were all natural children of Felisa Delgado.<br><br>However, Lucio Campo was not the first and only man in Felisa Delgado's life.  Before him was Ramon Osorio<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> with whom Felisa had a son, Luis Delgado. But, unlike her relationship with Lucio Campo which was admittedly one without the benefit of marriage, the legal status of Ramon Osorio's and Felisa Delgado's union is in dispute.  <br> <br>The question of whether Felisa Delgado and Ramon Osorio ever got married is crucial to the claimants because the answer will determine whether their successional rights fall within the ambit of the rule against reciprocal intestate succession between legitimate and illegitimate relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> If Ramon Osorio and Felisa Delgado had been validly married, then their only child Luis Delgado was a legitimate half-blood brother of Josefa Delgado and therefore excluded from the latter's intestate estate.  He and his heirs would be barred by the principle of absolute separation between the legitimate and illegitimate families. Conversely, if the couple were never married, Luis Delgado and his heirs would be entitled to inherit from Josefa Delgado's intestate estate, as they would all be within the illegitimate line. <br><br>Petitioners allege that Ramon Osorio and Felisa Delgado were never married.  In support thereof, they assert that no evidence was ever presented to establish it, not even so much as an allegation of the date or place of the alleged marriage.  What is clear, however, is that Felisa retained the surname Delgado. So did Luis, her son with Ramon Osorio. Later on, when Luis got married, his<span style="font-style: italic;"> Partida de Casamiento</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> stated that he was "<span style="font-style: italic;">hijo natural de Felisa Delgado</span>" (the natural child of Felisa Delgado),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> significantly omitting any mention of the name and other circumstances of his father.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</span></sup> Nevertheless, oppositors (now respondents) insist that the absence of a record of the alleged marriage did not necessarily mean that no marriage ever took place. <br> <br>Josefa Delgado died on September 8, 1972 without a will. She was survived by Guillermo Rustia and some collateral relatives, the petitioners herein. Several months later, on June 15, 1973, Guillermo   Rustia   executed   an   affidavit  of  self-adjudication of the remaining properties comprising her estate.<br>  <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MARRIAGE OF GUILLERMO RUSTIA  AND JOSEFA DELGADO</span><br> <br>Sometime in 1917, Guillermo Rustia proposed marriage to Josefa Delgado<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> but whether a marriage in fact took place is disputed.  According to petitioners, the two eventually lived together as husband and wife but were never married. To prove their assertion, petitioners point out that no record of the contested marriage existed in the civil registry.  Moreover, a baptismal certificate naming Josefa Delgado as one of the sponsors referred to her as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Se√±orita</span>" or unmarried woman.  <br> <br>The oppositors (respondents here), on the other hand, insist that the absence of a marriage certificate did not of necessity mean that no marriage transpired.  They maintain that Guillermo Rustia and Josefa Delgado were married on June 3, 1919 and from then on lived together as husband and wife until the death of Josefa on September 8, 1972.  During this period spanning more than half a century, they were known among their relatives and friends to have in fact been married.  To support their proposition, oppositors presented the following pieces of evidence: <br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Certificate of Identity No. 9592 dated [December 1, 1944] issued to Mrs. Guillermo J. Rustia by Carlos P. Romulo, then Resident Commissioner to the United States of the Commonwealth of the Philippines;<br> <br></li><li> Philippine Passport No. 4767 issued to Josefa D. Rustia on June 25, 1947;<br> <br></li><li> Veterans Application for Pension or Compensation for Disability Resulting from Service in the Active Military or Naval Forces of the United States- Claim No. C-4, 004, 503 (VA Form 526) filed with the Veterans Administration of the United States of America by Dr. Guillermo J. Rustia wherein Dr. Guillermo J. Rustia himself [swore] to his marriage to Josefa Delgado in Manila on 3 June 1919;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br> <br></li><li> Titles to real properties in the name of Guillermo Rustia indicated that he was married to Josefa Delgado. </li></ol></blockquote><br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ALLEGED HEIRS OF GUILLERMO RUSTIA</span><br> <br>Guillermo Rustia and Josefa Delgado never had any children.  With no children of their own, they took into their home the youngsters Guillermina Rustia Rustia and Nanie Rustia. These children, never legally adopted by the couple, were what was known in the local dialect as <span style="font-style: italic;">ampun-ampunan.  </span><br> <br>During his life with Josefa, however, Guillermo Rustia did manage to father an illegitimate child,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the intervenor-respondent Guillerma Rustia, with one Amparo Sagarbarria.  According to Guillerma, Guillermo Rustia treated her as his daughter, his own flesh and blood, and she enjoyed open and continuous possession of that status from her birth in 1920 until her father's demise.  In fact, Josefa Delgado's obituary which was prepared by Guillermo Rustia, named the intervenor-respondent as one of their children.  Also, her report card from the University of Santo Tomas identified Guillermo Rustia as her parent/guardian.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup> <br> <br>Oppositors (respondents here) nonetheless posit that Guillerma Rustia has no interest in the intestate estate of Guillermo Rustia as she was never duly acknowledged as an illegitimate child.  They contend that her right to compulsory acknowledgement prescribed when Guillermo died in 1974 and that she cannot claim voluntary acknowledgement since the documents she presented were not the authentic writings prescribed by the new Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <br> <br>On January 7, 1974, more than a year after the death of Josefa Delgado, Guillermo Rustia filed a petition for the adoption<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of their <span style="font-style: italic;">ampun-ampunan</span> Guillermina Rustia. He stated under oath "[t]hat he ha[d] no legitimate, legitimated, acknowledged natural children or natural children by legal fiction."<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</span></sup> The petition was overtaken by his death on February 28, 1974.<br> <br>Like Josefa Delgado, Guillermo Rustia died without a will.  He was survived by his sisters Marciana Rustia vda. de Damian and Hortencia Rustia-Cruz, and by the children of his predeceased brother Roman Rustia Sr., namely, Josefina Rustia Albano, Virginia Rustia Paraiso, Roman Rustia, Jr., Sergio Rustia, Francisco Rustia and  Leticia Rustia Miranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <br> <br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ANTECEDENT PROCEEDINGS</span><br></div> <br>On May 8, 1975, Luisa Delgado <span style="font-style: italic;">vda</span>. de Danao, the daughter of Luis Delgado, filed the original petition for letters of administration of the intestate estates of the "spouses Josefa Delgado and Guillermo Rustia" with the RTC of Manila, Branch 55.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This petition was opposed by the following: (1) the sisters of Guillermo Rustia, namely, Marciana Rustia vda. de Damian and Hortencia Rustia-Cruz;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (2) the heirs of Guillermo Rustia's late brother, Roman Rustia, Sr.,  and (3) the <span style="font-style: italic;">ampun-ampunan</span> Guillermina Rustia Rustia. The opposition was grounded on the theory that Luisa Delgado <span style="font-style: italic;">vda.</span> de Danao and the other claimants were barred under the law from inheriting from their illegitimate half-blood relative Josefa Delgado. <br> <br>In November of 1975, Guillerma Rustia filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings, claiming she was the only surviving descendant in the direct line of Guillermo Rustia. Despite the objections of the oppositors (respondents herein), the motion was granted. <br>        <br>On April 3, 1978, the original petition for letters of administration was amended to state that Josefa Delgado and Guillermo Rustia were <span style="font-style: italic;">never</span> married but had merely lived together as husband and wife.<br>        <br>On January 24, 1980, oppositors (respondents herein) filed a motion to dismiss the petition in the RTC insofar as the estate of Guillermo Rustia was concerned.  The motion was denied on the ground that the interests of the petitioners and the other claimants remained in issue and should be properly threshed out upon submission of evidence.<br>    <br>On March 14, 1988, Carlota Delgado<span style="font-style: italic;"> vda</span>. de de la Rosa substituted for her sister, Luisa Delgado vda. de Danao, who had died on May 18, 1987.  <br>        <br>On May 11, 1990, the RTC appointed Carlota Delgado<span style="font-style: italic;"> vda.</span> de de la Rosa as administratrix of both estates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision read:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, in view of all the foregoing, petitioner and her co-claimants to the estate of the late Josefa Delgado listed in the Petitions, and enumerated elsewhere in this Decision, are hereby declared as the only legal heirs of the said Josefa Delgado who died intestate in the City of Manila on September 8, 1972, and entitled to partition the same among themselves in accordance with the proportions referred to in this Decision.<br> <br>Similarly, the intervenor Guillerma S.

Presumptions are classified into presumptions of law and presumptions of fact.  Presumptions of law are, in turn, either conclusive or disputable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br> <br>Rule 131, Section 3 of the Rules of Court provides: <br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Disputable presumptions.</span> ‚Äî The following presumptions are satisfactory if uncontradicted, but may be contradicted and overcome by other evidence: <br> <br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx                               xxx                               xxx<br></div> <br>(aa) That a man and a woman deporting themselves as husband and wife have entered into a lawful contract of marriage;<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx                               xxx                               xxx<br></div> <br>In this case, several circumstances give rise to the presumption that a valid marriage existed between Guillermo Rustia and Josefa Delgado. Their cohabitation of more than 50 years cannot be doubted.  Their family and friends knew them to be married.  Their reputed status as husband and wife was such that even the original petition for letters of administration filed by Luisa Delgado <span style="font-style: italic;">vda.</span> de Danao in 1975 referred to them as "spouses."  <br> <br>Yet, petitioners maintain that Josefa Delgado and Guillermo Rustia had simply lived together as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage. They make much of the absence of a record of the contested marriage, the testimony of a witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> attesting that they were not married, and a baptismal certificate which referred to Josefa Delgado as "Se√±orita" or unmarried woman.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]  </span></sup><br> <br>We are not persuaded.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, although a marriage contract is considered a primary evidence of marriage, its absence is not always proof that no marriage in fact took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40] </sup>Once the presumption of marriage arises, other evidence may be presented in support thereof. The evidence need not necessarily or directly establish the marriage but must at least be enough to strengthen the presumption of marriage. Here, the certificate of identity issued to Josefa Delgado as Mrs. Guillermo Rustia,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</span></sup> the passport issued to her as Josefa D. Rustia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the declaration under oath of no less than Guillermo Rustia that he was married to Josefa Delgado<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43] </sup>and the titles to the properties in the name of "Guillermo Rustia married to Josefa Delgado," more than adequately support the presumption of marriage.  These are public documents which are <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence of the facts stated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> No clear and convincing evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of the truth of the recitals therein was presented by petitioners.   <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, Elisa <span style="font-style: italic;">vda</span>. de Anson, petitioners' own witness whose testimony they primarily relied upon to support their position, confirmed that Guillermo Rustia had proposed marriage to Josefa Delgado and that eventually, the two had "lived together as husband and wife." This again could not but strengthen the presumption of marriage. <br> <br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third,</span> the baptismal certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> was conclusive proof only of the baptism administered by the priest who baptized the child.  It was no proof of the veracity of the declarations and statements contained therein,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</span></sup> such as the alleged single or unmarried ("<span style="font-style: italic;">Se√±orita</span>") civil status of Josefa Delgado who had no hand in its preparation.   <br> <br>Petitioners failed to rebut the presumption of marriage of Guillermo Rustia and Josefa Delgado. In this jurisdiction, every intendment of the law leans toward legitimizing matrimony. Persons dwelling together apparently in marriage are presumed to be in fact married.  This is the usual order of things in society and, if the parties are not what they hold themselves out to be, they would be living in constant violation of the common rules of law and propriety. <span style="font-style: italic;">Semper praesumitur pro matrimonio.</span> Always presume marriage.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</span></sup><br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LAWFUL HEIRS OF JOSEFA DELGADO</span><br> <br>To determine who the lawful heirs of Josefa Delgado are, the questioned status of the cohabitation of her mother Felisa Delgado with Ramon Osorio must first be addressed. <br> <br>As mentioned earlier, presumptions of law are either  conclusive or disputable. Conclusive presumptions are inferences which the law makes so peremptory that no contrary proof, no matter how strong, may overturn them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> On the other hand, disputable presumptions, one of which is the presumption of marriage, can be relied on only in the absence of sufficient evidence to the contrary.<br> <br>Little was said of the cohabitation or alleged marriage of Felisa Delgado and Ramon Osorio. The oppositors (now respondents) chose merely to rely on the disputable presumption of marriage even in the face of such countervailing evidence as (1) the continued use by Felisa and Luis (her son with Ramon Osorio) of the surname Delgado and (2) Luis Delgado's and Caridad Concepcion's Partida de Casamiento<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> identifying Luis as <span style="font-style: italic;">"hijo natural de Felisa Delgado" </span>(the natural child of Felisa Delgado).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> <br> <br>All things considered, we rule that these factors sufficiently overcame the rebuttable presumption of marriage. Felisa Delgado and Ramon Osorio were never married. Hence, all the children born to Felisa Delgado out of her relations with Ramon Osorio and Lucio Campo, namely, Luis and his half-blood siblings Nazario, Edilberta, Jose, Jacoba, Gorgonio and the decedent Josefa, all surnamed Delgado,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> were her natural children.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52] </span></sup><br> <br>Pertinent to this matter is the following observation: <br><blockquote>Suppose, however, that A begets X with B, and Y with another woman, C; then X and Y would be natural brothers and sisters, but of half-blood relationship.  Can they succeed each other reciprocally?<br> <br>The law prohibits reciprocal succession between illegitimate children and legitimate children of the same parent, even though there is unquestionably a tie of blood between them.  It seems that to allow an illegitimate child to succeed <span style="font-style: italic;">ab intestato</span> (from) another illegitimate child begotten with a parent different from that of the former, would be allowing the illegitimate child greater rights than a legitimate   child.  Notwithstanding   this,  however,  we  submit  that succession should be allowed, even when the illegitimate brothers and sisters are only of the half-blood.  The reason impelling the prohibition on reciprocal successions between legitimate and illegitimate families does not apply to the case under consideration.  That prohibition has for its basis the difference in category between illegitimate and legitimate relatives.  There is no such difference when all the children are illegitimate children of the same parent, even if begotten with different persons.  They all stand on the same footing before the law, just like legitimate children of half-blood relation.  We submit, therefore, that the rules regarding succession of legitimate brothers and sisters should be applicable to them.  Full blood illegitimate brothers and sisters should receive double the portion of half-blood brothers and sisters; and if all are either of the full blood or of the half-blood, they shall share equally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote>Here, the above-named siblings of Josefa Delgado were related to her by full-blood, except Luis Delgado, her half-brother.  Nonetheless, since they were all illegitimate, they may inherit from each other. Accordingly, all of them are entitled to inherit from Josefa Delgado.<br> <br>We note, however, that the petitioners before us are already the nephews, nieces, grandnephews and grandnieces of Josefa Delgado. Under Article 972 of the new Civil Code, the right of representation in the collateral line takes place only in favor of the children of brothers and sisters (nephews and nieces). Consequently, it cannot be exercised by grandnephews and grandnieces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Therefore, the only collateral relatives of Josefa Delgado who are entitled to partake of her intestate estate are her brothers and sisters, or their children who were still alive at the time of her death on September 8, 1972.  They have a vested right to participate in the inheritance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The records not being clear on this matter, it is now for the trial court to determine who were the surviving brothers and sisters (or their children) of Josefa Delgado at the time of her death. Together with Guillermo Rustia,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</span></sup> they are entitled to inherit from Josefa Delgado in accordance with Article 1001 of the new Civil Code:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><blockquote>Art. 1001. Should brothers and sisters or their children survive with the widow or widower, the latter shall be entitled to one-half of the inheritance and the brothers and sisters or their children to the other one-half. </blockquote>Since Josefa Delgado had heirs other than Guillermo Rustia, Guillermo could not have validly adjudicated Josefa's estate all to himself.  Rule 74, Section 1 of the Rules of Court is clear.  Adjudication by an heir of the decedent's entire estate to himself by means of an affidavit is allowed only if he is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">sole</span> heir to the estate:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Extrajudicial settlement by agreement between heirs.</span> ‚Äì If the decedent left no will and no debts and the heirs are all of age, or the minors are represented by their judicial or legal representatives duly authorized for the purpose, the parties may, without securing letters of administration, divide the estate among themselves as they see fit by means of a public instrument filed in the office of the register of deeds, and should they disagree, they may do so in an ordinary action of partition. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If there is only one heir, he may adjudicate to himself the estate by means of an affidavit filed in the office of the register of deeds</span>. x x x (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LAWFUL HEIRS OF GUILLERMO RUSTIA</span><br> <br>Intervenor (now co-respondent) Guillerma Rustia is an illegitimate child<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> of Guillermo Rustia.  As such, she may be entitled to successional rights only upon proof of an admission or recognition of paternity.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</span></sup> She, however, claimed the status of an acknowledged illegitimate child of Guillermo Rustia only <span style="font-weight: bold;">after</span> the death of the latter on February 28, 1974 at which time it was already the new Civil Code that was in effect.<br> <br> Under the old Civil Code (which was in force till August 29, 1950), illegitimate children absolutely had no hereditary rights. This draconian edict was, however, later relaxed in the new Civil Code which granted certain successional rights to illegitimate children but only on condition that they were first recognized or acknowledged by the parent.<br> <br>Under the new law, recognition may be compulsory or voluntary.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</span></sup> Recognition is compulsory in any of the following cases: <br><blockquote>(1) in cases of rape, abduction or seduction, when the period of the offense coincides more or less with that of the conception;<br><br>(2) when the child is in continuous possession of status of a child of the alleged father (or mother)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> by the direct acts of the latter or of his family;<br><br>(3) when the child was conceived during the time when the mother cohabited with the supposed father;<br><br>(4) when the child has in his favor any evidence or proof that the defendant is his father. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote>On the other hand, voluntary recognition may be made in the record of birth, a will, a statement before a court of record or in any authentic writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]  </sup><br><br>Intervenor Guillerma sought recognition on two grounds: first, compulsory recognition through the open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child and second, voluntary recognition through authentic writing. <br> <br>There was apparently no doubt that she possessed the status of an illegitimate child from her birth until the death of her putative father Guillermo Rustia. However, this did not constitute acknowledgment but a <span style="font-style: italic;">mere ground by which she could have compelled acknowledgment through the courts</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Furthermore, any (judicial) action for compulsory acknowledgment has a dual limitation:  the lifetime of the child and the lifetime of the putative parent.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</span></sup> On the death of either, the action for compulsory recognition can no longer be filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66] </sup>In this case, intervenor Guillerma's right to claim compulsory acknowledgment prescribed upon the death of Guillermo Rustia on February 28, 1974.<br>   <br>The claim of voluntary recognition (Guillerma's second ground) must likewise fail. An authentic writing, for purposes of voluntary recognition, is understood as a genuine or indubitable writing of the parent (in this case, Guillermo Rustia).  This includes a public instrument or a private writing admitted by the father to be his.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67] </sup>Did intervenor's report card from the University of Santo Tomas and Josefa Delgado's obituary prepared by Guillermo Rustia qualify as authentic writings under the new Civil Code? Unfortunately not. The report card of intervenor Guillerma did not bear the signature of Guillermo Rustia. The fact that his name appears there as intervenor's parent/guardian holds no weight since he had no participation in its preparation. Similarly, while witnesses testified that it was Guillermo Rustia himself who drafted the notice of death of Josefa Delgado which was published in the SUNDAY TIMES on September 10, 1972, that published obituary was  not  the  authentic  writing  contemplated  by  the  law. What  could  have  been  admitted  as  an  authentic  writing was  the  original  manuscript  of  the  notice, in the handwriting of Guillermo Rustia himself and signed by him, not the newspaper clipping of the obituary.  The failure to present the original signed manuscript was fatal to intervenor's claim.  <br> <br>The same misfortune befalls the <span style="font-style: italic;">ampun-ampunan,</span> Guillermina Rustia Rustia, who was never adopted in accordance with law. Although a petition for her adoption was filed by Guillermo Rustia, it never came to fruition and was dismissed upon the latter's death.  We affirm the ruling of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals holding her a legal stranger to the deceased spouses and therefore not entitled to inherit from them ab intestato.  We quote:<br><blockquote>Adoption is a juridical act, a proceeding <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in rem</span>, which [created] between two persons a relationship similar to that which results from legitimate paternity and filiation.  Only an adoption made through the court, or in pursuance with the procedure laid down under Rule 99 of the Rules of Court is valid in this jurisdiction.  It is not of natural law at all, but is wholly and entirely artificial.  To establish the relation, the statutory requirements must be strictly carried out, otherwise, the adoption is an absolute nullity.  The fact of adoption is never presumed, but must be affirmatively [proven] by the person claiming its existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>   </blockquote>Premises considered, we rule that two of the claimants to the estate of Guillermo Rustia, namely, intervenor Guillerma Rustia and the <span style="font-style: italic;">ampun-ampunan</span> Guillermina Rustia Rustia, are not lawful heirs of the decedent.  Under Article 1002 of the new Civil Code, if there are no descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children, or surviving spouse, the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the deceased.  Therefore, the lawful heirs of Guillermo Rustia are the remaining claimants, consisting of his sisters,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> nieces and nephews.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</span></sup><br> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ENTITLEMENT TO LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION</span><br><br>An administrator is a person appointed by the court to administer the intestate estate of the decedent. Rule 78, Section 6 of the Rules of Court prescribes an order of preference in the appointment of an administrator:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6 <span style="font-style: italic;">When and to whom letters of administration granted.</span> ‚Äì If no executor is named in the will, or the executor or executors are incompetent, refuse the trust, or fail to give a bond, or a person dies intestate, administration shall be granted:<br> <br>(a) To the surviving husband or wife, as the case may be, or next of kin, or both, in the discretion of the court, or to such person as such surviving husband or wife, or next of kin, requests to have appointed, if competent and willing to serve;<br> <br>(b) If such surviving husband or wife, as the case may be, or next of kin, or the person selected by them, be incompetent or unwilling, or if the husband or widow or next of kin, neglects for thirty (30) days after the death of the person to apply for administration or to request that the administration be granted to some other person, it may be granted to one or more of the principal creditors, if competent and willing to serve;<br> <br>(c) If there is no such creditor competent and willing to serve, it may be granted to such other person as the court may select.</blockquote>In the appointment of an administrator, the principal consideration is the interest in the estate of the one to be appointed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The order of preference does not rule out the appointment  of  co-administrators,  specially  in  cases  where<br>justice and equity demand that opposing parties or factions be represented in the management of the estates,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> a situation which obtains here. <br>  <br>It is in this light that we see fit to appoint joint administrators, in the persons of Carlota Delgado vda. de de la Rosa and a nominee of the nephews and nieces of Guillermo Rustia.
