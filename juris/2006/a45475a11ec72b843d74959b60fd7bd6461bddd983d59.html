The dispositive portion of the Decision reads in full as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the petition is DISMISSED. The Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan dated November 6, 1998 and July 2, 1999<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> are AFFIRMED.

An exchange of pleadings followed.<br><br>On <span style="font-weight: bold;">October 8, 2002</span>, the Sandiganbayan issued <span style="font-weight: bold;">a Resolution</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  the<span style="font-style: italic;"> fallo </span>of which pertinently reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, Chuidian's Motion for Writ of Execution is DENIED.

The abuse, to borrow from the memorandum, came in the form of the anti-graft court's completely disregarding "<span style="font-style: italic;">the February 28, 2003 Deed of Assignment and Quitclaim entered into by Fidelity ... and TIDCORP as a supervening event that would effectively suspend the enforcement of, or much less, satisfy the January 19, 2001 decision of this Honorable Court which was reiterated by  [the Sandiganbayan]  in its orders dated October 08, 2003, July 2, 2003 and October 30, 2003."</span><br><br>Chuidian's recourse is, as earlier stated, focused on the  October 8, 2002 Resolution of the Sandiganbayan to the extent that it denied his motion for writ of execution involving the January 19, 2001 Decision of this Court in G.R. No. 139941.<br><br>As we see it, the decisive issue tendered in these consolidated  proceedings turns on the enforcement of the said final and executory January 19, 2001 Decision of the Court in G.R. No. 139941, the occurrence, if that be the case, of what petitioner PNB deems as supervening events  notwithstanding.<br><br>At the outset, one preliminary procedural issue needs to be addressed. We refer to the effect of the Court's order of consolidation contained in its Resolution of March 15, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> on the dismissal of the petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 156383</span>.</span><br><br>As may be recalled, the Court dismissed on February 26, 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 156383</span>, therein petitioner Chuidian failing to show that grave abuse of discretion attended the denial by the Sandiganbayan of his motion for issuance of writ of execution involving  the January 19, 2001 Decision. Therefrom, Chuidian moved for reconsideration which the Court, on April 30, 2003, denied. On June 12, 2003, Chuidian filed an <span style="font-style: italic;">Omnibus Motion for Leave to File Second Motion for Reconsideration, attaching thereto his Second Motion for Reconsideration. </span>Again, the Court denied said omnibus motion on January 14, 2004. Undaunted, Chuidian moved for reconsideration of the Court's January 14, 2004 denial action. It was when said motion was pending that the Court's order of consolidation of <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 156383 and G.R. No. 160723</span> was issued.<br><br>Chuidian argues that the consolidation order adverted to had, in effect,  given due course to his second motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his underlying petition in G.R. No. 156383. Citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Francisco</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Chuidian claims that since consolidation effectively merges all the different actions consolidated into a single action, and that the order of consolidation, if properly decreed, is binding upon all the parties to the different actions until it is vacated or set aside, the Court's order of consolidation in this case revived his heretofore dismissed petition in G.R. No. 156383.<br><br>We agree.<br><br>Consolidation presupposes that the actions covered by the corresponding order are pending in the same court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  Given this perspective, the irresistible conclusion is that the Court, with the  consolidation of <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 160723 with G.R. No. 156383</span>, effectively admitted Chuidian's second motion for reconsideration aforestated and, for all intents and purposes revived his petition in G.R. No. 156383.<br><br>Even assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo </span>that the order of consolidation did not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> work to revive <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 156383</span>, this Court is possessed with inherent power to suspend its own rules, to except a particular case or save a petition from its operations wherever the demands of justice so require.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It may be that in the minute Resolution of April 30, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court denied with finality Chuidian's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his petition in <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 156383.</span> However, it would be in keeping with fair play to reconsider said resolution or denial since the paramount issue here involves the upholding of the integrity of a final judgment of this Court that up to this day seems to have been treated as a pure jargon without effect whatsoever. As it were, the directive contained thereat appears to have been ignored by PNB.<br><br>To be sure, a reconsideration and eventual reinstatement of what may be considered a final denial action is not unprecedented. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Uy v. Land Bank of the Philippines,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court also granted therein petitioner Uy's similar second motion for reconsideration and reinstated in the process an otherwise peremptorily denied petition for review.<br><br>To reiterate what the Court has said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ginete v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and other cases, the rules of procedure should be viewed as mere instruments designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. They are not to be applied with severity and rigidity when such application would clearly defeat the very rationale for their conception and existence. Even the Rules of Court reflects this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules, inclusive of the one-motion rule,  can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself has already declared to be final. The peculiarities of this case impel us to do so now.<br><br>This brings us to the substantive aspect of these cases.<br><br>In its bid to be freed from liability arising from its issuance of L/C No. SFD -005-85, PNB argues that the 2003 Fidelity-TIDCORP Agreement is a new matter that arose after the finality of the  January 19, 2001 Decision in G.R. No. 139941 has set in. According to PNB, such agreement which it was not cognizant and could not have been aware of during the proceedings before this Court,  directly impacts on its obligation to remit the proceeds of the subject L/C to the Sandiganbayan. Thus, the resulting change of ownership of the L/C in favor of TIDCORP is of significant moment since, as PNB argues, it renders the implementation of the said January 19, 2001 Decision - as reiterated in subsequent Sandiganbayan issuances in Civil Case No. 0027 - unjust and inequitable for PNB to perform.<br><br>We are not persuaded by PNB's argument.<br><br>Long before the execution of the relied-upon quitclaim contracts between Fidelity and TIDCORP, on one hand, and TIDCORP and PNB on the other, L/C No. SFD-005-85 has been in <span style="font-style: italic;">custodia legis</span> of the Sandiganbayan, covered as the L/C was by the attachment order issued  on July 14, 1993. Chuidian was, therefore, correct in his contention that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Deed of Assignment and Quitclaim</span> covering the L/C did not, without more, vest any transferable right in favor of TIDCORP over the L/C. Consequently, TIDCORP could not have, as it cannot,  effectively released PNB from its obligation under the L/C since the Sandiganbayan held it in custody as a security for satisfaction of judgment in Civil Case No. 0027 pending before it. Attachment partakes of a proceeding <span style="font-style: italic;">in rem</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As such, it is against a particular thing itself instead of against a person<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that binds the property against the whole world. Such a proceeding reduces the property attached to an indebted thing and virtually condemns it to pay the owner's debt.<br><br>PNB, in foisting before this Court the alleged TIDCORP-PNB <span style="font-style: italic;">Deed of Release with Quitclaim</span> and the earlier Fidelity-TIDCORP <span style="font-style: italic;">Deed of Assignment and Quitclaim,</span> cannot plausibly feign ignorance of the Court's ruling in G.R. No. 139941 where we declared that:<br><blockquote>The validity of this Deed of Transfer [between the Republic and PNB]  is not disputed. Thus, PNB is estopped from denying its liability thereunder considering that neither the PNB nor the government bothered to secure petitioner's consent to the substitution of debtors. We are not unmindful that any effort to secure petitioner's consent at that time would, in effect, be deemed an admission that the L/C is valid and binding. Even the Sandiganbayan found that:<br><blockquote>". . . Movant has basis in pointing out that inasmuch as the L/C was issued in his favor, he is presumed to be the lawful payee-beneficiary of the L/C until such time that the plaintiff successfully proves that said L/C is ill-gotten and he has no right over the same.<br><br>In Republic v. Sandiganbayan, we held that the provisional remedies, such as freeze orders and sequestration, were not 'meant to deprive the owner or possessor of his title or any right to the property sequestered, frozen of taken over and vest it in the sequestering agency, the Government or other person."<br></blockquote>Thus, until such time that the government is able to successfully prove that petitioner has no right to claim the proceeds of the L/C, he is deemed to be the lawful payee-beneficiary of said L/C, for which any substitution of debtor requires his consent. The Sandiganbayan thus erred in relieving PNB of its liability as the original debtor. (Words in bracket added.)<br></blockquote>Given the foregoing perspective, it cannot now be said that the Republic, through TIDCORP, could have validly acquired ownership over the subject L/C No. SFD-005-85.  For, as long as Sandiganbayan has not, with finality, ruled on the ownership of said L/C, the same is presumptively owned by Chuidian. We said so in our judgment in <span style="font-style: italic;">G.R. No. 139941.</span><br><br>Lest it be overlooked, the authenticity and due execution of the Fidelity-TIDCORP Agreement and its legal effects have not actually been established as evidentiary fact in an appropriate judicial proceedings. In the strict legal viewpoint, therefore, PNB cannot, in this certiorari proceedings, validly invoke the same agreement of which it is not even a party.<br><br>For almost the same reason articulated above, neither can PNB, as against Chuidian, effectively set up the alleged TIDCORP-PNB <span style="font-style: italic;">Deed of Release with Quitclaim</span> to help its cause. What is more, TIDCORP, as the alleged assignee/successor-in-interest of Chuidian and beneficiary of L/C No. SSD-005-85, knew all along, being a respondent in G.R. No. 160723,  that the issue of ownership over the L/C is still subject of a pending litigation (Civil Case No. 0027) before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Petitioner PNB's urging for the Court to take judicial notice of both deeds in question cannot be done. This is because the existence, validity and enforceability of said documents, as Chuidian has pointed out at every turn, are not proper subjects of judicial cognizance under Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the light of the foregoing disquisitions, there is really no discharging "supervening event" yet upon which PNB can, for the nonce, (a) hitch its claim of non-liability as issuer of L/C No. SFD-005-85, and (b) invoke to exempt itself from complying with our underlying directive to remit the proceeds of the L/C to the Sandiganbayan. This is not necessarily to say that  it cannot, at the proper time and forum and after the deeds in question shall have, in proper proceedings, passed the test of authenticity and due execution, avail itself of the apparent beneficent effects of the same deeds.<br><br>While perhaps anti-climactic to so stress at this stage, PNB's attempt to resist complying with what is exacted of it under the January 19, 2001 Decision  came after it led, at some point, the Sandiganbayan to believe that it was bent on remitting  the proceeds of the L/C to that court in obedience to its and this Court's parallel orders. Two instances easily come to mind: First, as a matter of record, PNB requested the Bureau of Treasury to make available the amount covered by the subject L/C to be deposited in escrow  with the Land Bank of the Philippines  for the account of the Sandiganbayan;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>,  PNB made known its intention to obey the order to remit, but pleaded that it be given an extension to comply, considering (a) the huge amount involved, and (b) that there would be a need for PNB to comply first with certain bank procedures as well as some Central Bank regulations before it could remit the amount of US$4.4 Million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]<br><br></sup>Having made such representations, PNB cannot now claim that it is no longer liable under the January 19, 2001 Decision without violating the legal and equitable imperatives of estoppel. Accordingly, PNB's lament  about the Sandiganbayan gravely abusing its discretion when the latter denied its <span style="font-style: italic;">Manifestation in Lieu of Compliance</span> has to be rejected. What the Sandiganbayan said in its assailed denial October 30, 2003 Resolution commends itself for concurrence:<br><blockquote>The contention of movants PNB is without merit. It is emphasized that this Court is only enforcing the order of the Supreme Court directing it (PNB) to remit to this Court the proceeds of [L/C] No. SFD-005-85 in the amount of US$4.4 million, the same to be placed under special time deposit with the [LBP], <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the account of the Sandiganbayan in escrow for the person or persons, natural or juridical, who shall eventually be adjudged lawfully entitled thereto</span>, the same to earn interest at the current legal bank rates .... Indeed, the directive of the Supreme Court was not predicated upon the issue of ownership of the [L/C] as it will be held in escrow of whoever will be eventually adjudged lawfully entitled thereto. Thus, the information given by the PNB that TIDCORP ... is the obligor, beneficiary or guarantor of the subject Letter of Credit, even if we assume that to be true, will not serve as a valid excuse for the PNB not to comply with the order of the Supreme Court. This Court can no longer entertain any pleading which will eventually result in the non-compliance of the aforesaid Supreme Court Decision. Definitely, PNB cannot just exonerate itself from its obligation after it was given several extensions of time, which extensions were granted upon its assurance that it is exerting utmost effort to comply with the aforementioned Court's Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Words in bracket added; underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>It bears to stress at this juncture that the Sandiganbayan's October 8, 2002 Resolution and July 10, 2003 Order juxtaposed with its assailed October 30, 2003 resolution to veritably enforce and implement the Court's January 19, 2001 Decision in G.R. No. 139941. In a very real sense, therefore, the Sandiganbayan had already granted what petitioner Chuidian was then asking that court and, presently, this Court, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, the execution of said January 19, 2001 Decision, albeit a formal writ of execution has not been issued. Nonetheless, the October 30, 2003 ruling already commanded the Sheriff of the Sandiganbayan to take steps to ensure that PNB, at the risk of contempt, comply immediately with this Court's directive.<br><br>At bottom then, Chuidian's petition in G.R. No. 156383 has been rendered moot and academic by the Sandiganbayan's October 30, 2003 Resolution aforestated and its earlier resolution of the same tenor. A moot and academic case or issue is one that ceases to present a justifiable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a determination thereof would be of no practical value.  In such cases, there is no actual substantial relief to which petitioner would be entitled to and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>We close by making clear certain key premises holding this<span style="font-style: italic;"> ponencia</span> together and against which it is cast:<br><blockquote><ol><li>As peremptorily determined by the Court in its ruling in G.R. No. 139941, PNB is estopped from denying its liability under L/C No. SFD-005-85. The Deed of Transfer entered into on February 27, 1987 by and between the Republic and PNB whereby certain liabilities of PNB were transferred to the national government affects or is binding only on the contracting parties, their assigns and privies. It did not relieve PNB, as against Chuidian, from liability as the original debtor under the L/C since there was no valid substitution of debtor;<br><br></li><li>Chuidian remains the lawful payee-beneficiary of L/C No. SFD-005-85, until such time that the government, thru any of its agencies or any other interested party, is able to successfully prove in the proper forum that Chuidian has no right or has no longer any right to claim the proceeds of the L/C; and<br><br></li><li>The Decision of the Court in G.R. No. 139941 that the proceeds of L/C No. SFD-005-85 be deposited with the LBP to be held in escrow is, as the Sandiganbayan declared,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> a directive addressed to PNB, not an award for or against any party. The question as to whom such attached proceeds will eventually be awarded to shall be determined at the first instance in Civil Case No. 0027 of the Sandiganbayan, barring any supervening event that would change the factual or legal complexion of the case.<br></li></ol></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition in G.R.
