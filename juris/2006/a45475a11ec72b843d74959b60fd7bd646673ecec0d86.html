Cenzon is a member of the Board of Directors of Honig Sugar Trading Corp. (Honig).&nbsp; On the other hand, private respondent Margarita C. Sia is the president of South Pacific Sugar Corp. (South Pacific).<br><br>On 23 February 2000, petitioner Cenzon filed with the Makati City Prosecution Office, four complaint-affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against private respondent Sia for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 and Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, alleging that the checks issued by South Pacific, through private respondent Sia, were dishonored upon due presentment for having been the subject of a "stop payment order" (SPO), and for having been "drawn against insufficient funds" (DAIF).&nbsp; Despite demands made upon private respondent Sia and South Pacific to pay the amounts represented by the face value of the subject checks, the same remained unheeded.<br><br>The particulars of the subject checks are, to wit:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr style="text-align: center;" valign="top"><td>CHECK NO.</td><td>DATE</td><td>AMOUNT</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>HRR&nbsp;0005306682</td><td>31&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999</td><td><s>P</s>15,840,000.00</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>HRR 0005306773</td><td>24 May 1999</td><td><s>P</s>42,625,000.00</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>HRR 0005306775</td><td>24 May 1999</td><td><s>P</s>&nbsp;

In accordance therewith, Makati City Prosecutor Edgardo Hirang filed on 10 December 2001 with the RTC, two informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> against private respondent Sia for violations of Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.&nbsp; The two informations involved Check No. HRR 0005306682 and Check No. HRR 0005306774, which covered the amounts of P15,840,000.00 and P91,776,970.00, respectively.&nbsp; The City Prosecutor recommended NO BAIL.&nbsp; The cases were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 01-2709 and 2710, and subsequently consolidated as Criminal Case No. 01-2709-2710.<br><br>On 11 December 2001, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> directing the issuance of a warrant of arrest against private respondent Sia.&nbsp; On 29 January 2002, the RTC suspended the proceedings <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> for the reason that private respondent Sia had a pending Motion for Reconsideration with the DOJ Secretary, questioning the latter's finding of probable cause.&nbsp; Subsequently, in the hearing of 15 February 2002, the public prosecutor moved for the amendment of the informations from NO BAIL RECOMMENDED to BAIL SET AT P60,000.00 for each count of Estafa.&nbsp; The amendment was sought on the strength of DOJ Department Circular No. 74, issued on 6 November 2001, which specified the amount of bail to be recommended, in cases of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.&nbsp; The RTC granted the public prosecutor's Motion, as contained in the assailed Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of 15 February 2002.<br><br>Private prosecutor's Motion for Reconsideration of the 15 February 2002 Order was denied by the RTC, in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated 17 June 2002.&nbsp; Aggrieved, petitioner Cenzon filed with the Court of Appeals, a Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span>, imputing to the RTC, grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in authorizing the amendment of the informations to allow private respondent Sia to post bail.<br><br>In the assailed Decision of 26 February 2004, the Court of Appeals &nbsp;affirmed the RTC, ratiocinating that the offense by which private respondent Sia is charged is not punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, and as such, she is entitled to bail.&nbsp; The appellate court, relying on the pronouncements in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Hernando</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Panganiban</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> ratiocinated in the following manner:<blockquote>Based on the foregoing, it is clear that all persons are entitled to bail, as a matter of right, provided that one is not charged with an offense punishable by death, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, or life imprisonment. In the case at bench, We agree with the private respondent, and concurred in by no less than the Solicitor General, that the offense by which she is being charged is not punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> and so she is entitled to bail.&nbsp; Thus, the respondent judge is not guilty of grave abuse of discretion in allowing the amendment of the informations to allow accused-respondent Sia to post bail.<br><br>This was clearly illustrated in the leading case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Hernando</span> and reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Panganiban</span>, where it was clarified that <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> is not the prescribed penalty for the offense as used in PD No. 818, to wit:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>"Hence, if the amount of the fraud exceeds twenty-two thousand pesos, the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> is imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional ten thousand (P10,000.00) pesos but the total penalty shall not exceed thirty (30) years, which shall be termed <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>. As used herein, <span style="font-style: italic;">RECLUSION PERPETUA</span> IS NOT THE PRESCRIBED PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE. It merely describes the penalty actually imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved, which exceeds twenty two thousand (P22,000.00) pesos." (Emphasis Ours.)</blockquote>Precisely, this is the reason why DOJ Circular No. 74 came into effect, to guide all prosecutors in recommending the amount of bail to be fixed. Public Prosecutor Marcos thus correctly moved for the amendment of the informations, and the respondent judge judiciously allowed it to conform with the DOJ circular brought about by the new jurisprudence on the matter. Clearly, the ruling in People vs. Reyes cited by the petitioner is deemed superseded.<br><br>Moreover, as cited by the petitioner himself, courts are advised that they must not only be aware but should consider the Bail Bond Guide due to its significance in the administration of criminal justice. Settled also is the rule that, while not controlling, official opinions of the justice secretary are persuasive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>In the same vein, petitioner Cenzon's Motion for Reconsideration thereon was denied by the appellate court for lack of merit, in the Resolution dated 30 June 2004.<br><br>Elevating the matter before this Court <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> the instant Petition for Review, petitioner Cenzon submits the following grounds for its allowance, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I</div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH THE ESTABLISHED CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE THAT "NO DOCTRINE OR PRINCIPLE OF LAW LAID DOWN BY THE COURT IN A DECISION RENDERED <span style="font-style: italic;">EN BANC</span> OR IN DIVISION MAY BE MODIFIED OR REVERSED EXCEPT BY THE COURT SITTING <span style="font-style: italic;">EN BANC</span>."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II</div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE BY SOLELY RELYING ON THE CASES OF <span style="font-style: italic;">PEOPLE V. HERNANDO</span> AND <span style="font-style: italic;">PEOPLE V. PANGANIBAN </span>WHICH INVOLVE FACTS DIFFERENT FROM THE PRESENT CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner Cenzon endeavors to build his case by invoking <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Reyes</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ.&nbsp; According to petitioner Cenzon, the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ recommends NO BAIL for Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, if the amount of the fraud is P32,000.00 or over.&nbsp; It is petitioner Cenzon's theory that NO BAIL is recommended in such cases, because the penalty prescribed therein is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner Cenzon posits that the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ was made pursuant to Section 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Article III of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that crimes punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>to death, when evidence of guilt is strong, are not bailable.<br><br>Further, petitioner Cenzon asseverates that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes,</span> the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc </span>declared that Presidential Decree No. 818, which took effect as early as 1975, provided for the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>where bouncing checks of the requisite amount are involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> &nbsp;Proceeding therefrom, it is petitioner Cenzon's contention that, in the assailed Decision of 26 February 2004, the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on DOJ Department Circular No. 74,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which disregards the rule that Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, where the amount of the fraud is P32,000.00 or above is non-bailable.<br><br>Finally, petitioner Cenzon maintains that the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes</span> which was rendered <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span> cannot be declared superseded by the subsequent cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hernando</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban</span>, as the latter cases were rendered by divisions of this Court.&nbsp; Citing Section 4(3),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Article VIII of the Constitution, petitioner Cenzon argues that <span style="font-style: italic;">Hernando </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban </span>cannot overturn <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes </span>because no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the Court in a decision rendered <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc </span>or in division may be modified or reversed except by the Court sitting <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc</span>.<br><br>The issue presented for our consideration is, whether private respondent Sia, who is charged with Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, for having issued bouncing checks in the amounts of P91,776,970.00 and P15,840,000.00, may be granted bail, as a matter of right, in accordance with DOJ Department Circular No. 74, dated 6 November 2001.<br><br>At the outset, attention must be called to Section 4, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides:<blockquote>SEC. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bail, a matter of right; exception. – </span> All persons in custody shall be admitted to bail as a matter of right, with sufficient sureties, or released on recognizance as prescribed by law or this Rule (a) before or after conviction by the Metropolitan Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, or Municipal Circuit Trial Court, and (b) before conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, or life imprisonment.</blockquote>Thus, it must be asked, is private respondent Sia charged with an offense punishable by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>?<br><br>The issue that confronts us is not novel.&nbsp; Perforce, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban</span>, we settled that the term, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, as utilized in Presidential Decree No. 818, merely <span style="font-style: italic;">describes </span>the penalty imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved.&nbsp; The unequivocal import in Presidential Decree No. 818<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> is that, if the amount of the fraud exceeds twenty-two thousand pesos (P22,000.00), the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal </span>is imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional ten thousand (P10,000.00) pesos, but the total penalty shall not exceed thirty (30) years, which shall be termed <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.&nbsp; Taking our legal bearings from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban </span>case, we stress that the use of the term <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>in Presidential Decree No. 818 is merely to <span style="font-style: italic;">describe </span>the penalty imposed, but not the <span style="font-style: italic;">prescribed </span>penalty thereof.<br><br>To reiterate, we quote hereunder, our pronouncement in <span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban</span>:<blockquote>Finally, some clarifications on the imposable penalty.&nbsp; The trial court convicted accused-appellant to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, following the amendment to Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code by Presidential Decree No. 818, which increased the penalty for estafa committed by means of bouncing checks.<br><br>Presidential Decree No. 818 provides:<blockquote>SECTION 1. Any person who shall defraud another by means of false pretenses&nbsp; or fraudulent acts as defined in paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885, shall be punished by:<br><br>1<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; The penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos, and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos but the total penalty which may be imposed shall in no case exceed thirty years.&nbsp; In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed under the Revised Penal Code, the penalty shall be termed <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As used in Presidential Decree No. 818, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> is not the prescribed penalty for the offense, but merely describes the penalty actually imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved, which exceeds P22,000.00</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>The Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hernando</span> was just as succinct in pronouncing that the term <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>as used in Presidential Decree No. 818, merely describes the penalty actually imposed on account of the amount of the fraud involved, which exceeds twenty two thousand (P22,000.00) pesos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; As used in Presidential Decree No. 818, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua </span>is not the prescribed penalty for the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the Court, thru an <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc </span>Resolution, dated 26 February 2002, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Jovencio Lim and Teresita Lim v. People</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> pronounced that bail is allowed for the crime of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners therein were charged with the offense of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818, for having issued two postdated checks involving the amounts of P365,750.00 and P429,000.00.&nbsp; We allowed aforesaid petitioners to post bail in accordance with the provisions of DOJ Circular No. 74, dated 6 November 2001.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim</span>, we said that the intendment and provision of DOJ Circular No. 74 was to benefit the accused.&nbsp; Indeed, it is a principle of statutory construction that penal laws are liberally construed in favor of the accused and strictly against the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In like manner, we must also apply DOJ Circular No. 74 to herein private respondent Sia.<br><br>We find inapplicable the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes</span>.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes</span>, the question was whether therein accused who was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">convicted</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code and&nbsp; sentenced therefore to serve twenty-two years of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, with its accessory penalties and liability for indemnification, may be allowed to remain on bail during the pendency of her appeal from said conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Comparatively, what is before us is an accused <span style="text-decoration: underline;">charged</span> with Estafa under paragraph 2(d), Article 316 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; Clearly, <span style="font-style: italic;">Reyes </span>is not on all fours with the case at bar.&nbsp; Instead, it is the later case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim </span>which finds application.<br><br>Our Resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim</span>, dated 26 February 2002, and issued by the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc </span>settled the issue anent the allowance of bail in cases involving Estafa under paragraph 2(d), Article 316 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; As earlier stated, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lim</span>, we allowed the accused therein to post bail, and we upheld DOJ Department Circular No. 74, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Hernando</span>.&nbsp; In the more recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Poblete v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court underscored once more with definitive pronouncement the application of DOJ Department Circular No. 74 in cases involving the crime of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 818.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Stare decisis et non quieta movera</span>.<br><br>We said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Poblete</span>, thus:<blockquote>It was definitively resolved when the Court adopted Department of Justice (DOJ) Circular No. 74 ordaining that bail be allowed for the crime of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(d), as amended by P.D. 818, thru an En Banc Resolution dated February 26, 2002 in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Jovencio Lim and Teresita Lim v.

The salient portion of the Resolution reads:<blockquote>"(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the amount of fraud is P32,000.00 or over in which the imposable penalty is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal </span>to <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, bail shall be based on reclusion temporal maximum, pursuant to Par. 2(a) of the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, multiplied by P2,000.00 plus an additional of P2,000.00 for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00; Provided, however, that the total amount of bail shall not exceed P60,000.00."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>We are similarly not impressed with petitioner Cenzon's reliance on the 2000 Bail Bond Guide of the DOJ.&nbsp; Evidently, Department Circular No. 74 of the DOJ amended the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, the salient provisions thereof, reads thus:<blockquote>WHEREAS, under the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, no bail is recommended for estafa under Art. 315 2(d), RPC, as amended by PD 818, as well as for Qualified Theft when the amount of fraud or the value of the property involved is P32,000.00 or over;<br><br>WHEREAS, such policy has already been overtaken and rendered untenable by the new jurisprudence, particularly the ruling in People vs. Hernando, 317 SCRA 621 (1999);<br><br>WHEREFORE, in estafa under Art. 315 2(d), as amended by PD 818, and Qualified Theft, the bail to be recommended shall be governed by the following rules:<br><br>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">FOR ESTAFA (ART. 315, 2(d), RPC, as amended by PD 818: <br></span><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="4%">1)</td><td width="96%"><div align="justify">Where the amount of fraud involved does not exceed P22,000.00, bail shall be computed based on the applicable provisions of the 2000 Bail Bond Guide.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>2) </td><td><div align="justify">Where the amount of fraud involved is more than P22,000.00 but less than P32,000.00, bail shall be based on the maximum period of the imposable penalty of reclusion temporal multiplied by P2,000.00.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>3)</td><td><div align="justify"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where the amount of fraud is P32,000.00 or over in which the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua, bail shall be based on reclusion temporal maximum, pursuant to Par. 2(a) of the 2000 Bail Bond Guide, multiplied by P2,000.00, plus an additional of P2,000.00 for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00; Provided, however, that the total amount of bail shall not exceed P60,000.00.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied.)</span></div></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></div></blockquote>From the foregoing, if the amount of fraud is P122,000.00 or over, as in the case at bar, the amount of bail is P60,000.00.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.&nbsp; The Decision dated 26 February 2004 and Resolution dated 30 June 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
