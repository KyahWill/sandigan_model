Natividad, Judy U. Lim, Manuel R. Lahoz and Sotero Diola are the registered owners of various parcels of land covered by twelve (12) Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  The properties cover a total land area of about 78,178 square meters located in Barangay Suplang, Tanauan, Batangas.<br><br>In August 2003, each of the individual petitioners entered into a Joint Venture Development Agreement with co-petitioner Belle Corporation to develop the properties as part of an agricultural farm lot subdivision project known as "Plantation Hills at Tagaytay Greenlands Phase I" (the Project) for eventual sale to the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>With the development of the Project in full swing in mid-2004, respondent Laguna West Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. (Laguna West Cooperative) filed 9 <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> petitions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tanauan City, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inscription</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">an</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">adverse</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">claim</span>, the annotation of which the Registrar of Deeds allegedly failed to carry over to the TCTs of individual petitioners under the Property Registration Decree<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>.<br><br>In its petitions before the RTC, respondent Laguna West Cooperative claimed that as early as April 1996 it entered into separate Joint Venture Agreements (JVAs) with the herein individual petitioners' predecessors-in-interest Zacarias P.

Abraham Bermudez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in the latter's capacity as Registrar of Deeds of Tanauan.<br><br>In their Complaint, petitioners asserted that the April 1996 JVAs between Laguna West Cooperative and individual petitioners' predecessors-in-interest are void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> since they were executed within the 10-year prohibitory period under Republic Act No. 6657 (COMPREHENSIVE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW OF 1988),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the titles covering the properties having emanated from emancipation patents granted in November 1988 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27.<br><br>Petitioners alleged too in their complaint that the JVAs fall under management contracts prohibited under Republic Act No. 6657.<br><br>Invoking Article 1409<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the Civil Code, petitioners urged the RTC to declare the JVAs inexistent and void for being contrary to law and public policy.<br><br>By Order of September 15, 2004, the RTC dismissed petitioners' complaint, finding<br><blockquote>. . . that [as] the JVAs cover or involve land grants under the Presidential Decree No. 27 and allied agrarian reform laws, the Department of Agrarian Reform, through its adjudication board (DARAB), has primary jurisdiction to determine the validity or invalidity thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>For lack of merit, the RTC denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration, hence, the present petition for review on certiorari which raises a pure question of law.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>It is axiomatic that what determines the nature of an action, as well as which court has jurisdiction over it, are the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  In the determination of jurisdiction, the status or relationship of the parties, as well as the nature of the question that is the subject of their controversy, is also considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) is vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, with <span style="font-weight: bold;">exclusive original jurisdiction </span>over<span style="font-weight: bold;"> all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform </span>except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Original</span> jurisdiction means jurisdiction to take cognizance of a cause at its inception, try it and pass judgment upon the law and facts, while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive</span> jurisdiction precludes the idea of co-existence and refers to jurisdiction possessed to the exclusion of others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The DARAB has been created to assume the adjudicative powers and functions of the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Thus, the DARAB has been vested with jurisdiction to try and decide <span style="font-weight: bold;">all agrarian disputes</span>, cases, controversies, and matters or incidents involving the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  Its jurisdiction encompasses cases involving the "rights and obligations of persons, whether natural or juridical, engaged in the management, cultivation and use of all agricultural lands" covered by Republic Act No. 6657 and other agrarian laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The RTC amplified its dismissal of petitioners' complaint in this wise:<br><blockquote>There is no question that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">case</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">involve</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">agrarian</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dispute</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the parties</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tenurial</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relationship</span>. The Court dismissed the complaint not because the subject of the questioned JVAs is an agricultural land as erroneously assumed by the plaintiffs.  The complaint was dismissed because it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">involves controversy or issue in the implementation of R.A. 6657</span> – that is – whether or not the agricultural land beneficiaries has reneged its (sic) obligation by entering in the joint venture agreements and whether the terms thereof are violative of Sections 27 and 73 of the said Act including the restrictions annotated on the emancipation patents certificates[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The finding of the RTC that petitioners' complaint does not involve an agrarian dispute is a narrow and restrictive view of the nature of an agrarian dispute.  In the recent case of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Islanders CARP-Farmers Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative Development, Inc. v. Lapanday Agricultural and Development Corp.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court elucidated on the scope of an agrarian dispute, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span><br><blockquote>The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) has jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate all agrarian disputes involving the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL).  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Included</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">definition</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">agrarian disputes</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arising</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">other</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tenurial</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">arrangements</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">beyond</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">traditional</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">landowner-tenant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lessor-lessee</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relationship</span>.  Expressly, these arrangements are recognized by Republic Act No. 6657 as essential parts of agrarian reform.  Thus, the DARAB has jurisdiction over disputes arising from the instant Joint Production Agreement entered into by the present parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>In that case, the petitioner filed with the RTC a complaint for declaration of nullity of a Joint Production Agreement.  Upon motion, the case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.  The petitioner elevated the matter to this Court, contending that there being no tenancy or leasehold relationship between the parties, the case does not constitute an agrarian dispute cognizable by the DARAB.<br><br>In denying the petition in <span style="font-style: italic;">Islanders,</span> this Court held that while the relationship between the parties was not one of tenancy or agricultural leasehold, the controversy nonetheless fell within the sphere of agrarian disputes, citing, among other authorities, <span style="font-style: italic;">Department of Agrarian Reform v. Cuenca,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which held:<br><blockquote>All controversies on the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian Reform  (DAR),  even  though  they raise questions that are also legal or constitutional in nature.  All doubts should be resolved in favor of the DAR, since the law has granted it special and original authority to hear and adjudicate agrarian matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The JVAs subject of the petition for annulment of petitioners precisely involve the development and utilization of the subject agricultural lands. As successors-in-interest of the beneficiaries of the agricultural lands, individual petitioners seek to nullify the JVAs.  Since the controversy involves the rights and obligations of persons engaged in the management, cultivation and use of an agricultural land covered by CARP, the case falls squarely within the jurisdictional ambit of the DAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It bears emphasis that a resolution of the instant case principally entails a determination of the alleged commission of prohibited acts under Sections 27 and 73<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of Republic Act No. 6645.  In cases where allegations of violation or circumvention of land reform laws have been raised, this Court has declined to address them, it stating that petitioners must first plead their case with the DARAB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>   There is no reason why this Court should now hold otherwise.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga,</i> and <i>Velasco, Jr., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Spelled as "Nerissa" in the Verification/Certification portion of the Petition.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo,</span> pp. 55-66, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz,</span> Cubero in TCT Nos.
