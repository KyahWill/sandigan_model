				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present petition for certiorari under Rule 65 assails the Sandiganbayan Resolutions dated February 7 and 12, 2003 denying petitioner Joseph Victor G. Ejercito's Motions to Quash Subpoenas Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum, and Resolution dated March 11, 2003 denying his Motion for Reconsideration of the first two resolutions.<br><br>The three resolutions were issued in Criminal Case No. 26558, "<span style="font-style: italic;">People of the Philippines v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada, et al.,</span>" for plunder, defined and penalized in R.A. 7080, "AN ACT DEFINING AND PENALIZING THE CRIME OF PLUNDER."<br><br>In above-stated case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Estrada, et al.,</span> the Special Prosecution Panel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed on January 20, 2003 before the Sandiganbayan a Request for Issuance of Subpoena Duces Tecum for the issuance of a subpoena directing the President of Export and Industry Bank (EIB, formerly Urban Bank) or his/her authorized representative to produce the following documents during the hearings scheduled on January 22 and 27, 2003:  <br><blockquote>I. For <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trust Account No. 858</span>;<br><ol><li>Account Opening Documents;</li><li>Trading Order No. 020385 dated January 29, 1999;</li><li>Confirmation Advice TA 858;</li><li>Original/Microfilm copies, including the dorsal side, of the following: <br></li></ol><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>Bank of Commerce MC # 0256254 in the amount of P2,000,000.00;</li><li>Urban bank Corp.

The request was likewise granted by the Sandiganbayan.  A Subpoena Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum was accordingly issued on January 24, 2003.<br><br>Petitioner, claiming to have learned from the media that the Special Prosecution Panel had requested for the issuance of subpoenas for the examination of bank accounts belonging to him, attended the hearing of the case on January 27, 2003 and filed before the Sandiganbayan a letter of even date expressing his concerns as follows, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>:<br><blockquote>Your Honors:<br><br>It is with much respect that I write this court relative to the concern of subpoenaing <span style="font-weight: bold;">the undersigned's bank account</span> which I have learned through the media.<br><br>I am sure the prosecution is aware of our banking secrecy laws everyone supposed to observe.  But, instead of prosecuting those who may have breached such laws, it seems it is even going to use supposed evidence which I have reason to believe could only have been illegally obtained.<br><br>The prosecution was not content with a general request.  It even lists and identifies specific documents meaning someone else in the bank illegally released confidential information.<br><br>If this can be done to me, it can happen to anyone.  Not that anything can still shock our family.  Nor that I have anything to hide.  Your Honors.<br><br>But, I am not a lawyer and need time to consult one on a situation that affects every bank depositor in the country and should interest the bank itself, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and maybe the Ombudsman himself, who may want to investigate, not exploit, the serious breach that can only harm the economy, a consequence that may have been overlooked.  There appears to have been deplorable connivance.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>I hope and pray, Your Honors, that I will be given time to retain the services of a lawyer to help me protect my rights and those of every banking depositor. But the one I have in mind is out of the country right now.<br><br>May I, therefore, ask your Honors, that in the meantime, the issuance of the subpoena be held in abeyance for at least ten (10) days to enable me to take appropriate legal steps in connection with the prosecution's request for the issuance of subpoena concerning <span style="font-weight: bold;">my accounts.</span> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>From the present petition, it is gathered that the "accounts" referred to by petitioner in his above-quoted letter are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trust</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">858</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Savings</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Account</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">0116-17345-9</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In open court, the Special Division of the Sandiganbayan, through Associate Justice Edilberto Sandoval, advised petitioner that his remedy was to file a motion to quash, for which he was given up to 12:00 noon the following day, January 28, 2003.<br><br>Petitioner, unassisted by counsel, thus filed on January 28, 2003 a Motion to Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum praying that the subpoenas previously issued to the President of the EIB dated January 21 and January 24, 2003 be quashed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In his Motion to Quash, petitioner claimed that his bank accounts are covered by R.A. No. 1405 (The Secrecy of Bank Deposits Law) and do not fall under any of the exceptions stated therein.  He further claimed that the specific identification of documents in the questioned subpoenas, including details on dates and amounts, could only have been made possible by an earlier illegal disclosure thereof by the EIB and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) in its capacity as receiver of the then Urban Bank.<br><br>The disclosure being illegal, petitioner concluded, the prosecution in the case may not be allowed to make use of the information.<br><br>Before the Motion to Quash was resolved by the Sandiganbayan, the prosecution filed another Request for the Issuance of Subpoena Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum dated January 31, 2003, again to direct the President of the EIB to produce, on the hearings scheduled on February 3 and 5, 2003, the same documents subject of the January 21 and 24, 2003 subpoenas with the exception of the Bank of Commerce MC #0256254 in the amount of P2,000,000 as Bank of Commerce MC #0256256 in the amount of P200,000,000 was instead requested.  Moreover, the request covered the following additional documents:<br><blockquote>IV. For Savings Account No. 1701-00646-1:<br>1. Account Opening Forms;<br>2. Specimen Signature Card/s; and<br>3. Statements of Account.<br></blockquote>The prosecution also filed a Request for the Issuance of Subpoena Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum bearing the same date, January 31, 2003, directed to Aurora C. Baldoz, Vice President-CR-II of the PDIC for her to produce the following documents on the scheduled hearings on February 3 and 5, 2003: <br><blockquote><ol><li> Letter of authority dated November 23, 1999 re: SPAN [Special Private Account Number] 858;<br><br></li><li> Letter of authority dated January 29, 2000 re: SPAN 858;<br><br></li><li> Letter of authority dated April 24, 2000 re: SPAN 858;<br><br></li><li> Urban Bank check no. 052092 dated April 24, 2000 for the amount of P36, 572, 315.43;<br><br></li><li> Urban Bank check no. 052093 dated April 24, 2000 for the amount of P107,191,780.85; and<br><br></li><li> Signature Card Savings Account No. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">0116-17345-9</span>.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>The subpoenas prayed for in both requests were issued by the Sandiganbayan on January 31, 2003.<br><br>On February 7, 2003, petitioner, this time assisted by counsel, filed an Urgent Motion to Quash Subpoenae Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum praying that the subpoena dated January 31, 2003 directed to Aurora Baldoz be quashed for the same reasons which he cited in the Motion to Quash<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> he had earlier filed.<br><br>On the same day, <span style="font-weight: bold;">February 7, 2003,</span> the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution denying petitioner's Motion to Quash Subpoenae Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum dated January 28, 2003.<br><br>Subsequently or on<span style="font-weight: bold;"> February 12, 2003</span>, the Sandiganbayan issued a Resolution denying petitioner's Urgent Motion to Quash Subpoena Duces Tecum/Ad Testificandum dated February 7, 2003.<br><br>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration dated February 24, 2003 seeking a reconsideration of the Resolutions of February 7 and 12, 2003 having been denied by Resolution of <span style="font-weight: bold;">March 11, 2003</span>, petitioner filed the present petition.<br><br>Raised as issues are: <br><blockquote><ol><li> Whether petitioner's Trust Account No. 858 is covered by the term "deposit" as used in R.A. 1405;<br><br></li><li> Whether petitioner's Trust Account No. 858 and Savings Account No. 0116-17345-9 are excepted from the protection of R.A. 1405;  and<br><br></li><li> Whether the "extremely-detailed" information contained in the Special Prosecution Panel's requests for subpoena was obtained through a prior illegal disclosure of petitioner's bank accounts, in violation of the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine.<br></li></ol></blockquote>Respondent People posits that Trust Account No. 858<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> may be inquired into, not merely because it falls under the exceptions to the coverage of R.A. 1405, but because it is not even contemplated therein.  For, to respondent People, the law applies only to "deposits" which strictly means the money delivered to the bank by which a creditor-debtor relationship is created between the depositor and the bank.<br><br>The contention that trust accounts are not covered by the term "deposits," as used in R.A. 1405, by the mere fact that they do not entail a creditor-debtor relationship between the trustor and the bank, does not lie.  An examination of the law shows that the term "deposits" used therein is to be understood broadly and not limited only to accounts which give rise to a creditor-debtor relationship between the depositor and the bank.<br><br>The policy behind the law is laid down in Section 1:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Government to give encouragement to the people to deposit their money in banking institutions and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">discourage</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">private</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hoarding</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">properly</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">utilized</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">banks</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">authorized</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">loans</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assist</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">economic</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">development</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">country</span>.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>If the money deposited under an account may be used by banks for authorized loans to third persons, then such account, regardless of whether it creates a creditor-debtor relationship between the depositor and the bank, falls under the category of accounts which the law precisely seeks to protect for the purpose of boosting the economic development of the country.<br><br>Trust Account No. 858 is, without doubt, one such account.  The Trust Agreement between petitioner and Urban Bank provides that the trust account covers "deposit, placement or investment of funds" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Urban</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bank</span> for and in behalf of petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  The money deposited under Trust Account No. 858, was, therefore, intended not merely to remain with the bank but to be invested by it elsewhere.  To hold that this type of account is not protected by R.A. 1405 would encourage private hoarding of funds that could otherwise be invested by banks in other ventures, contrary to the policy behind the law.<br><br>Section 2 of the same law in fact even more clearly shows that the term "deposits" was intended to be understood broadly:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> All deposits <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whatever</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nature</span></span> with banks or banking institutions in the Philippines including investments in bonds issued by the Government of the Philippines, its political subdivisions and its instrumentalities, are hereby considered as of an absolutely confidential nature and may not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person, government official, bureau or office, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">except</span> upon written permission of the depositor, or in cases of impeachment, or upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, or in cases <span style="font-weight: bold;">where the money deposited <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">invested</span></span> is the subject matter of the litigation. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The phrase "of whatever nature" proscribes any restrictive interpretation of "deposits."  Moreover, it is clear from the immediately quoted provision that, generally, the law applies not only to money which is deposited but also to those which are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">invested</span>.  This further shows that the law was not intended to apply only to "deposits" in the strict sense of the word.  Otherwise, there would have been no need to add the phrase "or invested."<br><br>Clearly, therefore, R.A. 1405 is broad enough to cover Trust Account No. 858.<br><br>The protection afforded by the law is, however, not absolute, there being recognized exceptions thereto, as above-quoted Section 2 provides.  In the present case, two exceptions apply, to wit: (1) the examination of bank accounts is upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, and (2) the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation.<br><br>Petitioner contends that since plunder is neither bribery nor dereliction of duty, his accounts are not excepted from the protection of R.A. 1405. <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine National Bank v. Gancayco</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> holds otherwise:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cases</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unexplained</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wealth</span> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">similar</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cases</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bribery</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dereliction</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">duty</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reason</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seen</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">why</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">these</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">classes</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cases</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excepted</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rule</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">making</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bank</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deposits</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confidential.</span> The policy as to one cannot be different from the policy as to the other. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This policy expresses the notion that a public office is a public trust</span> and any person who enters upon its discharge does so with the full knowledge that his life, so far as relevant to his duty, is open to public scrutiny.<br></blockquote>Undoubtedly, cases for plunder involve unexplained wealth.  Section 2 of R.A. No. 7080 states so.<br><blockquote>SECTION 2. Definition of the Crime of Plunder; Penalties. — <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">public</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">officer</span></span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">himself</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">connivance</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">members</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">family,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relatives</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">affinity</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consanguinity,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">business</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">associates,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subordinates</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">other</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">persons,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">amasses,</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">accumulates</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">acquires</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">ill-gotten</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">wealth</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">through</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">combination</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">series</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">overt</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">criminal</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acts</span> as described in Section 1(d) hereof, in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Seventy-five million pesos (P75,000,000.00), shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guilty</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crime</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">plunder</span></span> and shall be punished by life imprisonment with perpetual absolute disqualification from holding any public office.  Any person who participated with said public officer in the commission of plunder shall likewise be punished.  In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances shall be considered by the court.  The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interests and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stock derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>An examination of the "overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d)" of R.A. No. 7080 would make the similarity between plunder and bribery even more pronounced since bribery is essentially included among these criminal acts.  Thus Section 1(d) states:<br><blockquote>d) "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ill-gotten wealth</span>" means any asset, property, business enterprise or material possession of any person within the purview of Section Two (2) hereof, acquired by him directly or indirectly through dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates and or business associates by any combination or series of the following means or similar schemes.<br><br>1) Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse, or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;<br><br>2)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> By receiving, directly or indirectly, any commission, gift, share, percentage, kickbacks or any other form of pecuniary benefit from any person and/or entity in connection with any government contract or project or by reason of the office or position of the public officer concerned;</span><br><br>3) By the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the National Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities or government-owned or -controlled corporations and their subsidiaries;<br><br>4) By obtaining, receiving or accepting directly or indirectly any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest or participation including promise of future employment in any business enterprise or undertaking;<br><br>5) By establishing agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combinations and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to benefit particular persons or special interests; or<br><br>6) By taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Indeed, all the above-enumerated overt acts are similar to bribery such that, in each case, it may be said that "no reason is seen why these two classes of cases cannot be excepted from the rule making bank deposits confidential."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The crime of bribery and the overt acts constitutive of plunder are crimes committed by public officers, and in either case the noble idea that "a public office is a public trust and any person who enters upon its discharge does so with the full knowledge that his life, so far as relevant to his duty, is open to public scrutiny" applies with equal force.<br><br>Plunder being thus analogous to bribery, the exception to R.A. 1405 applicable in cases of bribery must also apply to cases of plunder.<br><br>Respecting petitioner's claim that the money in his bank accounts is not the "subject matter of the litigation," the meaning of the phrase "subject matter of the litigation" as used in R.A. 1405 is explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Union Bank of the Philippines v.

To presume that the information was obtained in violation of R.A. 1405 would infringe the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions.<br><br>Thus, with the filing of the plunder case against former President Estrada before the Sandiganbayan, the Ombudsman, using the above independent information, may now proceed to conduct the same investigation it earlier conducted, through which it can eventually obtain the same information previously disclosed to it by the PDIC, for it is an inescapable fact that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bank</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">records</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioner</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">longer</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">protected</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">R.A.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1405</span> for the reasons already explained above.<br><br>Since conducting such an inquiry would, however, only result in the disclosure of the same documents to the Ombudsman, this Court, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">avoidance</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">time-wasteful</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">circuitous</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">way</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">administering</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">justice</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> upholds the challenged subpoenas.<br><br>Respecting petitioner's claim that the Sandiganbayan violated his right to due process as he was neither notified of the requests for the issuance of the subpoenas nor of the grant thereof, suffice it to state that the defects were cured when petitioner ventilated his arguments against the issuance thereof through his earlier quoted letter addressed to the Sandiganbayan and when he filed his motions to quash before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>IN SUM, the Court finds that the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing the challenged subpoenas for documents pertaining to petitioner's Trust Account No. 858 and Savings Account No. 0116-17345-9 for the following reasons:<br><br>1. These accounts are no longer protected by the Secrecy of Bank Deposits Law, there being two exceptions to the said law applicable in this case, namely: (1) the examination of bank accounts is upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, and (2) the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation.  Exception (1) applies since the plunder case pending against former President Estrada is analogous to bribery or dereliction of duty, while exception (2) applies because the money deposited in petitioner's bank accounts is said to form part of the subject matter of the same plunder case.<br><br>2. The "fruit of the poisonous tree" principle, which states that once the primary source (the "tree")  is shown to have been unlawfully obtained, any secondary or derivative evidence (the "fruit") derived from it is also inadmissible, does not apply in this case.  In the first place, R.A. 1405 does not provide for the application of this rule.  Moreover, there is no basis for applying the same in this case since the primary source for the detailed information regarding petitioner's bank accounts — the investigation previously conducted by the Ombudsman — was lawful.<br><br>3. At all events, even if the subpoenas issued by the Sandiganbayan were quashed, the Ombudsman may conduct on its own the same inquiry into the subject bank accounts that it earlier conducted last February-March 2001, there being a plunder case already pending against former President Estrada.  To quash the challenged subpoenas would, therefore, be pointless since the Ombudsman may obtain the same documents by another route.  Upholding the subpoenas avoids an unnecessary delay in the administration of justice.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE, </span>the petition is DISMISSED.

A "bank deposit" is defined as a contractual relationship ensuing from  the  delivery,  by one known as the depositor of money, funds or even things into the possession of the bank,  which  receives  the same upon  the agreement to pay, repay or return, upon  the order or demand of the depositor, the money, funds, or equivalent amount. This agreement on the part of the bank is usually a tacit one and implied, and it may include an implied promise to pay interest upon the deposit, depending upon  the nature of the deposit and the account  into which it is placed  (10 Am Jur 2d Banks 337, cited in page 121, Ballentine's Law Dictionary, Third Edition).  x x x The Court is inclined to adopt the broader or expanded definition of the word "deposit" in R.A. 1405 as to encompass trust accounts consistently with the state policy declared in Section 1 thereof which is "to give encouragement to the people to deposit their money in banking institution and to discourage private hoarding so that the same may be properly utilized by banks in authorized loans to assist in the economic development of the country."

Aside from it being not recognized as one of the grounds to quash the subpoena, the mere fact that the request for subpoena specified the documents which are to be brought to court, cannot, by itself proved that there was conspiracy on the part of the prosecution, the officials of Export and Industry Bank as well as of the officials of the PDIC to violate the bank secrecy law.  <b>As clarified by the prosecution, the documents listed in the request were obtained in February, 2001, pursuant to the power conferred on the Ombudsman under Section 15 (8) of R.A. 6770, long before the Supreme Court promulgated the <i>Marquez v.

Finally, he insists that the "extremely-detailed" information in the Special Prosecution Panel's <i>requests for subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</i> shows prior illegal disclosure of his bank accounts, in violation of his constitutional right to due process and privacy.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent People contends  that  petitioner's  bank deposits  are actually proceeds of a "trust account," hence, subject of inquiry under R.A. No. 1405.<br><br>I find the petition impressed with merit.<br><br>The case at bar brings to fore R.A. No. 1405 or the <i>Secrecy of Bank Deposits Act</i>.  A glimpse at its history provides an adequate backdrop for our ensuing discussion.<br><br>On September 9, 1955, the Philippine Legislature enacted R.A. No. 1405.  Its rationale is to discourage private hoarding and encourage people to deposit money in banks to be utilized in authorized loans.  It happened that after World War II, capital and credit facilities for agricultural and industrial development in the country were lacking.  Rehabilitation of the banking system became a major government thrust.  However, private hoarding of money was rampant because people feared government inquiry into their bank deposits and bond investments for tax collection purposes.  Thus, even if the members of Congress at that time recognized the possible danger of R.A. No. 1405, such as providing a climate conducive to tax evasion,  still,  they passed the law with the belief that the benefits accruing to the economy with the influx of deposits and bond investments would counterbalance immeasurably the losses of the Government from such tax evasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>   Section 2, the core of R.A. No. 1405, then reads:<blockquote><b>Sec. 2. All deposits of whatever nature</b> with banks or banking institutions in the Philippines including investments in bonds issued by the Government of the Philippines, its political subdivisions and its instrumentalities, are hereby considered as of an <b>absolutely confidential nature</b> and may not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person, government official, bureau or office<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>except upon written permission of the depositor, or in cases of impeachment, or upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, or in cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation</b>.</blockquote>In 1981, Former President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1792 to provide for additional exceptions to the "absolutely confidential nature" of bank deposits.  These additional exceptions are: (1) when the examination is made in the course of a special or general examination of a bank; or (2) when the examination is made by an independent auditor hired by the bank to conduct its regular audit. Section 2 of R.A. No. 1405, as amended, thus reads:<blockquote><b>SEC.2</b> All deposits of whatever nature with banks or banking  institutions  in the Philippines including investments in bonds issued by the Government of the Philippines,  its political subdivisions and its instrumentalities, are hereby considered as of an <b>absolutely confidential nature</b> and may not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person, government official, bureau or office,  <b>except, when the examination is made in the course of a special or general examination of a bank  and  is  specifically authorized by the Monetary Board after being satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that a bank fraud or serious irregularity has been or is being committed and that it is necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud or irregularity, or when the examination is made by an independent auditor hired by the bank to conduct its regular audit provided that the examination is for audit purposes only and the results thereof shall be for the exclusive use of the bank</b>, or upon written permission of the depositor, or in case of impeachment, or upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, or in cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of litigation.  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The foregoing amendment was premised on the realization that the old provision adversely limited the examining authority of the Central Bank.  Allegedly, such limitation was contrary to the effective supervision of banks and endangered the safety of deposits.<br><br>However, in 1992, P.D. No. 1792 was expressly repealed by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7653, otherwise known as the <i>New Central Bank Act</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  Aside from encouraging domestic savings, R.A. No. 7653 sought to uphold the <b>right of citizens to privacy</b>. Also, the then members of Congress were of the consensus that relaxed disclosure rules are not conducive to healthy competition among banks and other financial institutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]<br><br></sup>Thus, we go back to the original provision of Section 2 of R.A. No. 1405 allowing  deposits  to  be "examined, inquired or looked into" under the following exceptions: <b>(1)</b> upon written permission of the depositor;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>(2)</b> in cases of impeachment; <b>(3)</b> upon order of a competent court in  cases of bribery  or  dereliction of  duty of public officials; or <b>(4) </b>in cases where themoney deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>I shall now resolve both issues.<br><br><center><b><i>Inquiry Falls Under the Exceptions<br>to the Confidentiality Rule and, therefore,<br>may be Inquired into by Respondent Sandiganbayan.<br><br></i></b></center>Petitioner contends that plunder is neither bribery nor dereliction of duty, hence, the inquiry on his bank accounts cannot be considered an exception under R.A.

Gancayco</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> case, this Court held for the first time that the exception "upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials" is not exclusive, and that <b>analogous cases</b> may be considered as falling within the same exception. There, "<b>cases of unexplained wealth</b>" were considered analogous to "cases of bribery or dereliction of duty."  The Court's instructive pronouncement is  quoted  hereunder:<blockquote>"With regard to the claim that disclosure would be contrary to the policy making bank deposits confidential, it is enough to point out that while section 2 of Republic Act 1405 declares bank deposits to be "absolutely confidential," it nevertheless allows such disclosure in the following instances:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>(1)</b> Upon written permission of the depositor; <b>(2)</b> In cases of impeachment; <b>(3)</b> <b>Upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials; (4)</b> In cases where the money deposited is the subject matter of the litigation. <b>Cases of unexplained wealth are similar to cases of bribery or dereliction of duty and no reason is seen why these two classes of cases cannot be excepted from the rule making bank deposits confidential.

Purisima</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>  Incidentally, both cases involve Republic Act No. 3019, the <i>Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act</i>.<br><br>Today, this Court is faced with this important query — <i>is plunder analogous to bribery, dereliction of duty or cases of unexplained wealth?</i>  I need not indulge in a lengthy disquisition to show that plunder belongs to the same genre of cases.  Under Republic Act No. 7080, <i>An Act Penalizing the Crime of Plunder</i>, this crime is committed by a public officer who, by himself or in connivance with others, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth, the aggregate amount or total value of which is at least Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00), through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts. The essence of plunder lies in the phrase "<b>combination or series of overt or criminal acts</b>."  <b>Bribery and violations of R.A. No. 3019 are only some of the criminal acts that comprise the more serious crime of   plunder.  In other words, these are some of the predicate crimes of plunder.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]  </sup>All the criminal acts are enumerated hereunder:<blockquote><b>(1)</b> Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse, or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;<b><br><br>(2)</b> By receiving, directly or indirectly, any commission, gift, share, percentage, kickbacks, or any other form of pecuniary benefit from any person and/or entity in connection with any government contract or project or by reason of the office or position of the public officer concerned;<b><br><br>(3)</b> By the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the National Government or any of its subdivision, agencies or instrumentalities or government–owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries;<br><br><b>(4)</b> By obtaining, receiving or accepting directly, or indirectly any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest or participation including the promise of future employment in any business enterprise or undertaking;<b><br><br>(5)</b> By establishing agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combinations and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to benefit particular person or special interests; or<br><br><b>(6)</b> By taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection, or influence to unjustly enrich himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.</blockquote>A reading of the provisions of the Revised Penal Code concerning bribery<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and dereliction of duty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> as  well as corrupt practices under R.A. 3019,  readily shows the striking resemblance between them and the predicate crimes of plunder. Paragraph 2 actually constitutes indirect bribery while paragraphs 4 and 5 constitute corrupt practices under R.A. No. 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  Logically, if the criminal acts that make up the crime of plunder are categorized as exceptions to the confidentiality rule, with more reason that the more serious crime of plunder should be considered as falling within the same exception.  <b>All involve dishonesty and lack of integrity in public service.</b>  There is no reason why plunder should be treated differently.<br><br>Petitioner now avers that this Court's rulings in <i>Philippine National Bank and Banco Filipino</i> do not apply to the present case because the <i>subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</i> in said cases were issued prior to the amendment of Section 8, R.A. No. 3019.  He stresses that under the old provision, the properties that may be considered, when a public official's acquisition of properties through legitimate means cannot be satisfactory shown, are only those of his "<b>spouse and unmarried children</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> However, under the new provision, the phrase "<b>spouse and unmarried children</b>" was changed to "spouse and <b>dependents</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  Thus, he contends that while he is a "<b>son</b>" of the accused in the plunder case, he is not his "<b>dependent</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]<br><br></sup>Petitioner's argument lacks merit.<br><br>The amendment of Section 8 could not have the effect of limiting the government's inquiry only to the properties of the "<b>spouse and dependents</b>" of a public official.  This is in light of this Court's broad pronouncement in <i>Banco Filipino</i> that the inquiry extends to <b>"any other persons,"</b> and that "<b>restricting the inquiry only to property held by or in the name of the government official or employee, or his spouse and unmarried children</b>" is <b>"unwarranted"</b> and <b>"an absurdity that we cannot ascribe to our lawmakers."</b>   Thus:<blockquote>The inquiry into legally acquired property — or property NOT "legitimately acquired" — <b>extends to cases where such property is concealed by being held by or recorded in the name of other persons</b>.  This  proposition is made clear by R.A. No. 3019<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  which quite categorically states  that  the  term,  legitimately acquired property of a public office or employee shall not include  x   x   x   property  unlawfully  acquired  by  the  respondent,  but  its  ownership  is concealed by its being recorded in the name of, or held by, <b>respondent's spouse, ascendants, descendants, relatives or <i>any other persons</i></b>.<b><br><br>To sustain the petitioner's theory, and restrict the inquiry only to property held by or in the name of the government official or employee, or his spouse and unmarried children is unwarranted in the light of the provisions of the statutes in question, and would make available to persons in government who illegally acquire property an easy and fool-proof means of evading investigation and prosecution; all they would have to do would be to simply place the property in the possession or name of persons other than their spouse and unmarried children. This is an absurdity that we will not ascribe to the lawmakers.</b></blockquote>Undoubtedly, the policy enunciated is to prevent a public official from evading prosecution or investigation by allowing government inquiry even to properties in the name of his "<b>spouse, ascendants, descendants, relatives or any other persons</b>." The Court's pronouncement renders insignificant the personal circumstance of the public official's child, i.e. whether he is a dependent or independent, married or unmarried. This is entirely logical. Section 8 itself starts with the statement: "<i>If in accord with the provisions of Republic Act numbered One thousand three hundred seventy</i>–<i>nine, a public official has been found to have acquired during his incumbency, <b>whether in his name or in the name of other persons</b>, an amount of property and/or money manifestly out of proportion to his salary and to his other lawful income, that fact shall be a ground for dismissal or removal</i>."  Likewise, Republic Act No. 1379,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> excludes the following properties from the definition of <b>"other legitimately acquired property:" <br></b><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"1.

Furthermore, as pointed out by respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, there is nothing in the exception "upon order or a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials" "<b>which would suggest that in order for the exception to apply, the owner of the deposit or of the account must be an accused in the case where the information relative to the account is sought to be adduced</b>."<br><br>Petitioner also contends that the money deposited in his bank accounts cannot be considered the "subject matter" of the plunder case.<br><br>I am not persuaded.<br><br>The "subject matter of litigation" as used in R.A.

Petitioner cites the case of <i>Mathay vs. Consolidated Bank and Trust Company</i>, where we defined "subject matter" of the action," thus:<blockquote><b>'By the phrase 'subject matter of the action' is meant 'the physical facts, the things real or personal, the money, lands, chattels, and the like, in relation to which the suit is prosecuted, and not the delict or wrong committed by the defendant.'</b></blockquote>Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals confuses the <b>'cause of action'</b> with the <b>'subject of the action.'</b> In <i>Yusingco v. Ong Hing Lian</i>, petitioner points out, this Court distinguished the two concepts.<blockquote>x   x   x "The cause of action is the legal wrong threatened or committed, while the object of the action is to prevent or redress the wrong by obtaining some legal relief; <b>but the subject of the action is neither of these since it is not the wrong or the relief demanded, the subject of the action is the matter or thing with respect to which the controversy has arisen, concerning which the wrong has been done, and this ordinarily is the property, or the contract and its subject matter, or the thing in dispute</b>."</blockquote>The argument is well-taken. We note with approval the difference between the <b>'subject of the action'</b> from the <b>'cause of action.'</b> We also find petitioner's definition of the phrase <b>'subject matter of the action'</b> is consistent with the term <b>'subject matter of the litigation,'</b> as the latter is used in the Bank Deposits Secrecy Act.<br><br>In <i>Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Magsino</i>, where the petitioner bank inadvertently caused the transfer of the amount of US$1,000,000.00 instead of only US$1,000.00, the Court sanctioned the examination of the bank accounts where part of the money was subsequently caused to be deposited:<blockquote><b>'x  x  x  Section 2 of [Republic Act No. 1405] allows the disclosure of bank deposits in cases where the money deposited is the subject matter of the litigation. Inasmuch as Civil Case No. 26899 is aimed at recovering the amount converted by the Javiers for their own benefit, necessarily, an inquiry into the whereabouts of the illegally acquired amount extends to whatever is concealed by being held or recorded in the name of persons other than the one responsible for the illegal acquisition.'</b></blockquote>Clearly, <i>Mellon Bank</i> involved a case where the money deposited was the subject matter of the litigation since the money so deposited was the very thing in dispute."</blockquote>There is no denying that the subject matter of a plunder case is the <b>ill-gotten wealth</b> accumulated, amassed or acquired by a public officer either by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons,the aggregate or total value of which is at least P50,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>   Since the money deposited in petitioner's bank accounts is being proven to be a portion of former President Estrada's ill-gotten wealth, it follows that it is the "thing or matter with respect to which the crime of plunder has arisen." <b>Without the ill-gotten wealth, there can be no plunder.  </b>Correspondingly, R.A.

Such reality places a customer's bank account within the "expectations of privacy" category.  In the Philippines, the expectation is heightened by the enactment of R.A. No. 1405 which mandates that all deposits of whatever nature are considered as of an "<b>absolutely confidential nature</b>" and "<b>may not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person</b>" except under the instances therein.<br><br>Admittedly, a bank customer knowingly and voluntarily divulges his financial affairs with the bank, but such is immaterial. The fact that one has disclosed private papers to the bank within the context of confidential customer-bank relationship, does not mean that one has waived all right to the privacy of the papers.

United States</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> who, having paid the toll, was entitled to "assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world," so the customer of a bank, having written or deposited a check, has a reasonable expectation that his check will be examined for bank purposes only.  Practically speaking, a customer's disclosure of his financial affairs is not entirely volitional, since it is impossible to participate in the economic life of contemporary society without maintaining a bank account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Consequently, the customer's reasonable expectation is that, <b>absent customary legal process</b>, the matter he reveals to the bank will be utilized by the bank only for internal banking purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]<br><br></sup><b>In the instant case, while admittedly, respondent <i>Sandiganbayan's</i> inquiry into petitioner's bank accounts falls under the two exceptions mentioned in R.A.

Desierto ordered petitioner Lourdes Marquez, a Branch Manager of Union Bank, to produce for purposes of an <i>in camera</i> inspection certain bank documents relative to a case pending before the Office of the Ombudsman. Ombudsman Desierto cited the Constitution and Section 15 (8) of R.A. No. 6770 as bases of his authority. Petitioner Marquez initially refused but, after having been threatened with a contempt proceeding, she filed a petition for declaratory relief seeking a clarification of the issue "<b>whether the Order of the Ombudsman to have an <i>in camera</i> inspection of the questioned account is allowed as an exception to the law on secrecy of bank deposits</b>."  The Court's ruling is enlightening, thus:<blockquote>"An examination of the secrecy of bank deposits law (R.A. No. 1405) would reveal the following exceptions: <br><ol><li>Where the depositor consents in writing;</li><br><li>Impeachment case;</li><br><li>By court order in bribery or dereliction of duty cases against public officials.</li><br><li>Deposit is subject of litigation.</li><br><li>Sec. 8, R.A. No. 3019, in cases of unexplained wealth as held in the case of <i>PNB v. Gancayco</i>.</li></ol>The order of the Ombudsman to produce for <i>in camera</i> inspection  the subject accounts with the Union Bank of the Philippines, Julia Vargas Branch, is based on a <b>pending investigation at the Office of the Ombudsman against Amado Lagdameo</b>, et al. for violation of R.A. No. 3019, Sec. 3 (e) and (g) relative to the Joint Venture Agreement between the Public Estates Authority and AMARI.<br><br>We rule that before an <i>in camera</i> inspection may be allowed there must be a pending case before a court of competent jurisdiction. Further, the account must be clearly identified, the inspection limited to the subject matter of the pending case before the court of competent jurisdiction. <b>The bank personnel and the account holder must be notified to be present during the inspection, and such inspection may cover only the account identified in the pending case.</b>"<br><br>In <i>Union Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>, we held that 'Section 2 of the Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits, as amended, declares bank deposits to be 'absolutely confidential' except:<blockquote><b>(1)</b> In an examination made in the course of a special or general examination of a bank that is  specifically authorized by the Monetary Board after being satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that a bank fraud or serious irregularity has been or is being committed and that is necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud or irregularity;<b><br><br>(2) </b>In an examination made by an independent auditor hired by the bank to conduct its regular audit provided that the examination is for audit purposes only and the results thereof shall be for the exclusive use of the bank;<br><br><b>(3) </b>Upon written permission of the depositor;<b><br><br>(4)</b> In cases of impeachment;<br><br><b>(5) </b>Upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials; or<br><br><b>(6) </b>In cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation.'</blockquote><b>In the case at bar, there is yet no pending litigation before any court of competent authority.  What is existing is an investigation by the Office of the Ombudsman.  In short, what the Office of the Ombudsman would wish to do is to fish for additional evidence to formally charge Amado Lagdameo, at al., with the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>. Clearly, there was no pending case in court which would warrant the opening of the bank account for inspection.</b>"</blockquote>Thus, as held by the Court, before an <i>in camera</i> inspection of bank documents maybe allowed, <b>there must be a pending case before a court of competent jurisdiction</b>. The Information for plunder against Former President Estrada was filed with respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i> on <b>April 4, 2001</b>.  On the other hand, the Ombudsman issued the <i>subpoenae duces tecum</i> on <b>February 8, 16, and March 7, 2001</b>.  Clearly, there was yet no pending litigation before any court when such <i>subpoenae</i> were issued.  Following the Court's ruling in <i>Marquez</i>, what the Office of the Ombudsman would wish to do was to "<b>fish for evidence</b>" in order to formally charge former President Estrada before respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i>.<br><br>At this point, it should be emphasized that the authority of the Ombudsman "to examine and have access to bank accounts and records" must be read in conjunction with Section 2 of R.A. No. 1405 providing that deposits of whatever nature shall be considered confidential except in several instances already mentioned.  <b>This is because bank deposits belong to a protected zone where government intrusion could infringe legitimate expectation of privacy.</b>  An opposite course is unwarranted.<br><br>In <i>United States v. United States District Court</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the US Supreme Court held that the <b>potential for abuse is particularly acute where the legislative scheme permits access to information without invocation of the judicial process.</b> In such instances, the important responsibility for balancing societal and individual interests is left to unreviewed executive discretion, rather than the scrutiny of a neutral magistrate.   In <i>Katz v. United States</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the same Court ruled that, "[t[he prosecutors' duty and responsibility is to enforce the laws, to investigate and to prosecute. Those charged with the investigative and prosecutorial duty should not be the sole judges of when to utilize constitutionally sensitive means in pursuing their tasks. <b>The historical judgment is that unreviewed executive discretion may yield too readily to pressures to obtain incriminating evidence and overlook potential invasions of privacy.</b>"  Between the government and the citizen, there must be a neutral entity that should balance the former's claim of authority vis-á-vis the latter's assertion of rights.<br><br>By the natural scheme of things, the Office of the Ombudsman can hardly be characterized as detached, disinterested and neutral.  Its mandate is to investigate and prosecute any act or omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency that appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>  In carrying out such mandate, it is expected to act with vigor and aggressiveness. But to permit such office to have  access to bank records without any judicial control as to relevancy or other traditional requirements of due process and to allow the evidence to be used in any subsequent prosecution, opens the door to a vast and unlimited range of very real abuses of police power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> True, there are administrative summonses for documents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> recognized in other jurisdictions, but there is a requirement that their enforcement receives a judicial scrutiny and a judicial order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>   In this regard, I am appalled by the "whole sale" <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> issued by the Ombudsman directing the "President or Chief Executive Officer of Urban Bank" to produce "<b>bank records and all documents relative thereto pertaining to all bank accounts (Savings, Current, Time Deposit, Trust, Foreign Currency Deposits, etc...) under  the  account  names  of  Jose  Velarde, Joseph E. Estrada, Laarni Enriquez, Guia Gomez, Joy Melendrez, Peachy Osorio, Rowena Lopez, Kevin or Kelvin Garcia, 727, 737, 747, 757 and 858</b>."  Indubitably, such blanket <i>subpoena</i> provides occasions for "fishing expedition."<br><br>Above everything else, however, what strikes us most is the patent unfairness of the process. First in the Bill of Rights is the mandate that no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty or property without due process of law.  <b>Courts have held that the right of personal privacy is one aspectof the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>  Basic due process demands that the Office of the Ombudsman furnish petitioner a copy of the <i>subpoenae duces tecum</i> it issued.  In <i>Marquez v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> this Court held: "<b>The bank personnel and the <u>account holder</u> must be notified to be present during the inspection, and such inspection may cover only the account identified in the pending case.</b>"  Such notice is not too much to ask for, after all, an accountholder bears the risk not only of losing his privacy but, also, his property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>  Of course, not to mention the procedural impasse that is encountered by such accountholder who cannot contest the propriety of the issuance of a <i>subpoena</i>.<br><br>In this case, petitioner was completely unaware of the issuance of <i>subpoenae duces tecum</i>, hence, he never had the opportunity to challenge them. As a matter of fact, almost two years had passed before he learned of such issuance and the resulting disclosure.  Indeed, the ugly truth here is that neither the Office of the Ombudsman nor the PDIC notified petitioner of the impending and actual disclosure of his bank accounts.  Such absence of notice is a fatal constitutional defect that inheres in a process that omits provision for notice to the bank customer of an invasion of his protected right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]<br><br></sup>Now, let us take a glimpse at the proceedings before respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i>.<br><br>The proceedings before respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i> also leave much to be desired.  Neither respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i> nor the Special Prosecution Panel nor PDIC furnished petitioner copies of the <i>subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</i> or of the requests for their issuance.    It bears reiterating that it was only through the media that petitioner learned about such requests. Definitely, something is inherently wrong in a public proceeding that allows a holder of bank account, subject of litigation, to be completely uninformed.  Also not to be overlooked is the respondent <i>Sandiganbayan's</i> oral directive to petitioner to file his motion to quash not later than 12:00 noon of January 28, 2003.  This notwithstanding the fact that it was only the day before, or on January 27, 2003, that petitioner learned about the requests and that he was yet to procure the services of a counsel.  Every civilized state adheres to the principle that when a person's life and liberty are jeopardized by government action, it behooves a democratic government to see to it that this jeopardy is <b>fair, reasonable</b> and according to<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>time-honored tradition</b>. The <b>importance of this principle is eloquently underscored by one observer who said:</b> "<i>The quality of a civilization is largely determined by the fairness of its criminal trials.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Respondent Sandiganbayan cannot justify its omission by relying on <i>Adorio v. Bersamin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> which held that: "<i>Requests by a party for the issuance of subpoenas do not require notice to other parties to the action.  No violation of due process results by such lack of notice since the other parties would have ample opportunity to examine the witnesses and documents subpoenaed once they are presented in court.</i>" Suffice it to say that <b>petitioner was not a party to the plunder case</b>, hence, he could not have the opportunity to examine the witnesses and the documents subpoenaed.<br><br>True, bank accounts at times harbor criminal plans. But this is not a reason to declare an open season for inquiry. Customers have a constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy in the documentary details of the financial transactions reflected in their bank accounts. That wall of privacy, however, is not impregnable. Our Constitution, as well as our laws, provides procedures whereby the confidentiality of one's financial affairs may be disclosed. In other words, access to bank records is controlled by <b>adequate legal process</b>.  Here, the <i>subpoenae</i> issued by respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, tainted as they are by the vices that afflict the proceedings before the Office of the Ombudsman, cannot be considered to have been issued pursuant to such <b>adequate legal process</b>. Petitioner, therefore, has reason to feel aggrieved.<br><br>Section 4, Rule 21 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, provides that the court may quash a <i>subpoenae duces tecum</i> upon motion if it is "<b>unreasonable and oppressive</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  Here, the three (3)<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><i>subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</i> issued by respondent <i>Sandiganbayan</i> are "unreasonable and oppressive" for the reasons earlier mentioned.

The Sandiganbayan reasoned that the crime of plunder was analogous to the said cases. It opined that the fact that petitioner JV Ejercito was not an accused in the plunder cases was of no moment because RA 3019 allows the inquiry into the bank deposits not only of the accused public official but also those of his spouse and children. Further, whether or not the amount of deposits was manifestly out of proportion to the income need not be proved first before inquiry could be had on the bank deposits, rather such inquiry could be used in proving the case.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan also held that petitioner JV Ejercito's reliance on <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez v. Desierto</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> was misplaced. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez,</span> the Court disallowed the in camera inspection of accounts in connection with a case pending before the Ombudsman. In the present case, however, the Sandiganbayan held that there was precisely a pending case before it, a competent court within the meaning of the exception to the bank secrecy laws.  The Sandiganbayan also pointed out that there was nothing irregular in the issuance of the subpoenas because it was not required that the other party be notified of such requests. No violation of due process resulted by such lack of notice since the other parties would have ample opportunity to examine the witnesses and documents subpoenaed once they are presented in court.<br><br>A similar motion was filed by petitioner JV Ejercito involving the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span> issued to the representative of the Urban Bank and Mrs. Aurora Baldoz of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Commission (PDIC). The said motion was denied by Sandiganbayan in the assailed Resolution dated February 12, 2003. The motions for reconsideration were denied in the assailed Resolution dated March 11, 2003.<br><br>Petitioner JV Ejercito now comes to the Court assailing the Sandiganbayan's resolutions denying his motions to quash the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span>.<br><br>As the petitioner himself submits, the following are the issues for the Court's resolution:<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT COURT ACTED IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN RULING THAT THE SUBPOENA ON PETITIONER'S BANK ACCOUNTS FALLS UNDER THE EXCEPTIONS PROVIDED UNDER R.A. NO. 1405<br><br>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT COURT ACTED IN EXCESS OF ITS JURISDICTION OR WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN RULING THAT THE CASES OF <span style="font-style: italic;">PNB VS.

In fact, he expressly admits the same and even explains that these were originally opened at Urban Bank but are now maintained at Export and Industry Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The petitioner argues that his accounts do not fall under any of the exceptions enumerated under Section 2 of RA 1405. The said provision reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. All deposits of whatever nature with banks or banking institutions in the Philippines including investments in bonds issued by the Government of the Philippines, its political subdivisions and its instrumentalities, are hereby considered as of an absolutely confidential nature and may not be examined, inquired or looked into by any person, government official, bureau or office, except, when the examination is made in the course of a special or general examination of a bank and is specifically authorized by the Monetary Board after being satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that a bank fraud or serious irregularity has been or is being committed and that it is necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud or irregularity, or when the examination is made by an independent auditor hired by the bank to conduct its regular audit provided that the examination is for audit purposes only and the results thereof shall be for the exclusive use of the bank, or upon written permission of the depositor, or in case of impeachment, or upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials, or in cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of litigation. (As amended by PD No. 1792)<br></blockquote>Based on this provision, it has been declared that bank deposits are absolutely confidential <span style="font-style: italic;">except</span> in the following instances:<br><blockquote>(1) In an examination made in the course of a special or general examination of a bank that is specifically authorized by the Monetary Board after being satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that a bank fraud or serious irregularity has been or is being committed and that it is necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud or irregularity;<br><br>(2) In an examination made by an independent auditor hired by the bank to conduct its regular audit provided that the examination is for audit purposes only and the results thereof shall be for the exclusive use of the bank;<br><br>(3) Upon written permission of the depositor;<br><br>(4) In cases of impeachment;<br><br>(5) Upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials; or<br><br>(6) In cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner points out that one of the exceptions mentioned is "upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials." Since the cases filed against his father, former President Estrada, are not for these crimes but for plunder and illegal use of alias, then the said exception does not allegedly apply. Further, his accounts do not fall under exception (6) as they are not allegedly "subject matter of litigation."<br><br>This argument of the petitioner is not persuasive. Former President Estrada is being charged with plunder as defined and penalized under Section 2 of RA 7080,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Definition of the Crime of Plunder, Penalties. </span>— Any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth</span> through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) hereof in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and shall be punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> to death. Any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense. In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court. The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interest and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stocks derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State. (As amended by Sec. 12, RA 7659).<br></blockquote>Section 1(d) of the same law defines "ill-gotten wealth" as "any asset, property, business enterprise or material possession of any person within the purview of Section 2 thereof, acquired by him directly or indirectly through dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates, and/or business associates by any combination or series of the following means or similar schemes:  <br><blockquote><ol><li>Through misappropriation, conversion, misuse or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;</li><br><li>By receiving, directly or indirectly, any commission, gift, share, percentage, kickbacks or any other form of pecuniary benefit from any person and/or entity in connection with any government contract or project or by reason of the office or position of the public officer concerned;</li><br><li>By the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the National Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities, or government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries;</li><br><li>By obtaining, receiving or accepting directly or indirectly any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest or participation including the promise of future employment in any business enterprise or undertaking;</li><br><li>By establishing agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combination and/or implementation of decrees and others intended to benefit particular persons or special interests; or</li><br><li>By taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines.</li></ol></blockquote>It can be readily gleaned that the gravamen of plunder is the amassing, accumulating or acquiring of ill-gotten wealth by a public officer, his family or close associates. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine National Bank v. Gancayco,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court explained that "cases of unexplained wealth are similar to cases of bribery or dereliction of public duty and no reason is seen why these two classes of cases cannot be excepted from the rule making bank deposits confidential. The policy as to one cannot be different from the policy as to the other. This policy expresses the notion that a public office is a public trust and any person enters upon its discharge does so with full knowledge that his life, so far as relevant to his duty, is open to public scrutiny."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>A plain reading of the definition of plunder and the manner by which it may be committed as provided in RA 7080 reveals that its policy also rests upon the fundamental tenet that "public office is a public trust."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> There is thus no cogent reason to treat plunder any different from the cases of bribery or dereliction of public duty for purposes of RA 1405.<br><br>The petitioner next contends that <span style="font-style: italic;">Gancayco</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Banco Filipino Savings v. Purisima</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> insofar as they expounded Section 8 of RA 3019 are not applicable to his case.  He reasons that in these cases, when the subpoenas subject thereof were issued, the text of Section 8 of RA 3019 provided that: "x x x Properties in the name of the <span style="font-style: italic;">spouse</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">unmarried children</span> of such public official may be taken into consideration x x x. Bank deposits shall be taken into consideration in the enforcement of this section, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding."<br><br>On the other hand, Section 8 of RA 3019, as presently worded upon its amendment by<span style="font-style: italic;"> Batas Pambansa Blg.</span> 195 on March 16, 1986, reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 8. <span style="font-style: italic;">Prima facie evidence of and dismissal due to unexplained wealth.</span> — If in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act Numbered One thousand three hundred seventy-nine, a public official has been found to have acquired during his incumbency, whether in his name or in the name of other persons, an amount of property and/or money manifestly out of proportion to his salary and to his other lawful income, that fact shall be a ground for dismissal or removal. Properties in the name of the spouse and dependents of such public official may be taken into consideration, when their acquisition through legitimate means cannot be satisfactorily shown. Bank deposits in the name of or manifestly excessive expenditures incurred by the public official, his spouse or any of their dependents including but not limited to activities in any club or association or any ostentatious display of wealth including frequent travel abroad of a non-official character by any public official when such activities entail expenses evidently out of proportion to legitimate income, shall likewise be taken into consideration in the enforcement of this section, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary. The circumstances hereinabove mentioned shall constitute valid ground for the administrative suspension of the public official concerned for an indefinite period until the investigation of the unexplained wealth is completed.<br></blockquote>The petitioner theorizes that prior to the amendment, the following may be taken into consideration in the enforcement of Section 8 of RA 3019:<br><blockquote>c) properties in the name of the spouse and unmarried children of the public official; and<br><br>d) bank deposits (without any qualification by law).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>After its amendment on March 16, 1982, the following may allegedly be taken into consideration in the enforcement of Section 8 of RA 3019:<br><blockquote>c) properties in the name of the spouse and dependents of the public official; and<br><br>d) bank deposits in the name of the public official, his spouse or any of their dependents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>According to the petitioner, although he is the son of former President Estrada, he is absolutely not his dependent. Petitioner avers that he is in his own right a legitimate businessman having investments in several entities when he opened the subject accounts in Urban Bank, now Export and Industry Bank.  Further, he is also the Municipal Mayor of San Juan, Manila. He thus urges the Court against applying the rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gancayco</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Banco Filipino</span> in the light of the amendment of Section 8 of RA 3019.<br><br>The petitioner's contention is equally unpersuasive. It should be recalled that the petitioner in <span style="font-style: italic;">Banco Filipino</span> posited that the inquiry into illegally acquired property should be restricted to property held by or in the name of the government official or employee or his spouses and unmarried children. The Court rejected this argument as it pronounced that:<br><blockquote>To sustain the petitioner's theory, and restrict the inquiry only to property held by or in the name of the government official or employee, or his spouse and unmarried children is unwarranted in the light of the provisions of the statutes in question, and would make available to persons in government who illegally acquired property an easy and fool-proof means of evading investigation and prosecution; all they would have to do would be to simply place the property in the possession or name of persons other than their spouse and unmarried children. This is an absurdity that we will not ascribe to the lawmakers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>At this point, it is well to mention that based on the evidence presented by the prosecution before the Sandiganbayan, hundreds of millions of pesos flowed from the petitioner's Trust Account No. 858 to the alleged Jose Velarde account purportedly maintained by former President Estrada at Equitable PCIBank. In fact, one manager's check, marked as Exhibit "L" for the prosecution, in the amount of P107,191,780.85 was drawn from, and funded by the said trust account of petitioner JV Ejercito.<br><br>Considering the mind-boggling sums of money that flowed out of the petitioner's Trust Account No. 858 and its nexus to former President Estrada's alleged Jose Velarde account, it is logical for the prosecution to pursue the theory that the money in the said trust account forms part of the unexplained wealth of the latter. As such, the money in the accounts of the petitioner may be properly considered as "subject matter" of the plunder cases falling under number (6) of the enumerated exceptions to the absolute confidentiality of bank deposits.<br><br>Viewed in this context, the petitioner's assertion that since he is no longer a dependent of his father, then the rulings in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gancayco</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Banco Filipino</span> are not applicable to his case is, to say the least, quite lame. In fact, to sustain his theory would, as the Court stated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Banco Filipino,</span> "make available to persons in government who illegally acquired property an easy and fool-proof means of evading investigation and prosecution; all they would have to do would be to simply place the property in the possession or name of persons other than their spouse and unmarried children. This is an absurdity that we will not ascribe to the lawmakers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The petitioner bewails the "extremely-detailed" information contained in the Special Prosecution Panel's requests for the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span>. The information upon which the requests were based was allegedly illegally and improperly obtained.<br><br>The petitioner opines that there had been prior disclosure by the bank and its personnel of data and information relative to his trust and savings accounts considering the very detailed information contained in the request for the subpoenas, to wit:<br><blockquote>a) Trading Order No. 020385 dated January 29, 1999;<br>b) Confirmation Advice TA 858;<br>c) Trust Agreement dated January 1999;<br>d) Special Private Account No. (SPAN) 858;<br>e) Savings Account No. 0116-17345-9;<br>f) Letter of authority dated November 23, 1999 re:SPAN 858;<br>g) Letter of authority dated January 29, 2000 re: SPAN 858;<br>h) Letter of authority dated April 24, 2000 re: SPAN 858;<br>i) Urban Bank check no. 052092 dated April 24, 2000 for the amount of P36,572,315.43;<br>j) Urban Bank check no. 052093 dated April 24, 2000 the amount of P107,191,780.85.<br></blockquote>According to the petitioner, the bank officials and personnel are criminally liable for releasing, without his knowledge, consent and authorization, information relative to his accounts to the prosecution. Further, since the information used to support the requests for the subpoenas was not secured by court order, such information was illegally acquired and the requests for subpoenas containing the said illegally acquired information are already a direct violation of RA 1405. Consequently, such illegally acquired information cannot be used in any proceeding. He invokes the constitutional provision on the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and purpose and that any evidence obtained in violation thereof shall be inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The petitioner cites the following pronouncement of the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez:</span><br><blockquote>Zones of privacy are recognized and protected in our laws. The Civil Code provides that "[e]very person shall respect the dignity, personality, privacy and peace of mind of his neighbors and other persons" and punishes as actionable torts several acts for meddling and prying into the privacy of another. It also holds a public officer or employee or any private individual liable for damages for any violation of the rights and liberties of another person, and recognizes the privacy of letters and other private communication. The Revised Penal Code makes a crime of the violation of secrets by an officer, the revelation of trade and industrial secrets, and trespass to dwelling. Invasion of privacy is an offense in special laws like the Anti-Wiretapping Law, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Secrecy of Bank Deposits Act,</span> and the Intellectual Property Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>A review of the incidents related to the present case will show why the petitioner's reliance on <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span> is misplaced. In the said case, the Office of the Ombudsman issued a subpoena addressed to Marquez, a bank officer of Union Bank, directing her to bring several bank documents for <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span> inspection in connection with an investigation being conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>Marquez refused to comply with the said directive and sought recourse to the Court by filing a petition and raising therein the issue of whether the order of the Office of the Ombudsman to have an <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span> inspection of the questioned account was allowed as an exception to the law on secrecy of bank deposits.<br><br>According to the Court, notwithstanding Section 15(8) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act), "before an <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span> inspection may be allowed, there must be a pending case before a court of competent jurisdiction. Further, the account must be clearly identified, the inspection limited to the subject matter of the pending case before the court of competent jurisdiction.

However, as early as February 8, 2001 or before the promulgation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez,</span> the Office of the Ombudsman, relying on Section 15(8) of RA 6770 and on the basis of information obtained during the impeachment proceedings of former President Estrada, issued a subpoena addressed to Urban Bank. The documents sought under the subpoena pertained to numbered accounts 727, 737, 747, 757 and <span style="font-weight: bold;">858</span> allegedly in the names of Jose Velarde, Joseph E. Estrada, Laarni Enriquez, Guia Gomez, Joy Melendrez, Peachy Osorio, Rowena Lopez, Kevin or Kelvin Garcia.<br><br>In compliance with the said subpoena, the PDIC, as then receiver of Urban Bank, issued a certification on February 13, 2001, as to the availability of bank documents relating to A/C 858 and T/A 858 and the non-availability of bank records as to the other accounts named in the subpoena. Based on the PDIC certification, the Office of the Ombudsman issued on February 16, 2001 another subpoena directing the production of documents pertinent to accounts A/C 858 and T/C 858. The PDIC again complied and furnished the Office of the Ombudsman on February 21, 2001 certified copies of the following documents:<br><blockquote><ol><li> Transaction registers dated 7-02-99, 8-16-99, 9-17-99, 10-18-99, 11-22-99,1-07-00, 01-17-00, 04-03-00 and 04-24-00;<br><br></li><li> Report of Unregularized TAFs &amp; DTs For UR COIN A &amp; B Placements of Various Branches as of February 29, 2000 and as of December 16, 1999; and<br><br></li><li> Trading Orders Nos.

With respect to the other documents described by petitioner JV Ejercito as "extremely-detailed," the Special Prosecution Panel explains how they came to know about these documents in this manner:<br><blockquote>What is more, Attachment "2-a," the compliance letter from the PDIC, specifically mentioned, as among the documents transmitted thereby, a LIST (Attachment "2-B") pertaining to the documents available in connection with Account No. 858, which list and documents (listed therein) were furnished the Office of the Ombudsman: <br><blockquote>In compliance with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Subpoena Duces Tecum</span> dated February 8, 2001 issued by the Office of the Ombudsman, transmitted are:<br><ol><li>Certification on available bank documents relating to A/C 858 and T/A 858 <span style="font-weight: bold;">contained in a list attached thereto</span> xxx (emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>There is a list, therefor, apart from the documents themselves (furnished the Office of the Ombudsman) to which said list is attached, from which details can be lifted. Thus, as to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trading Order No. 020385 dated January 29, 1999,</span> it must be noted that it is the second item in the list (Attachment "2-b" hereof) under document no. A-2. It is also among the documents furnished by the PDIC.<br><br>As to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Confirmation Advice TA 858</span>, it must be noted that this is a specific but not detailed document being sought in the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena</span> regarding Account No. 858, in general. For those familiar with banking practice, such is an expected document <span style="font-style: italic;">of course,</span> or one issued in the course of placements since it has been previously established that Account No. 858 is a Trust Account. A confirmation advice, therefore, is a reasonable and expected document to be found in trust accounts to evidence participation in specific amounts.  A sample of said confirmation advice, in the amount of <span style="font-weight: bold;">P200 Million,</span> and which is among the documents officially furnished the Office of the Ombudsman during the investigation leading to the charge for plunder against former President Joseph Estrada, et al., is attached as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Attachment "36."</span><br><br>Further, the list (Attachment "2-b" hereof) enumerates a number of confirmation advices sufficient for the plaintiff to ask for the same in the instant <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena.</span> However, as earlier explained, even in the absence of such a list, any person could reasonably expect such a document in Trust Account No. 858 to evidence participation.<br><br>As to the Trust Agreement dated January 1999, since the account had been established as a Trust Account, it is reasonable to presume and expect that there is such a Trust Agreement on or about January 1999, coinciding with the date of the Trading Order, existing in the records.<br><br>Surely, this needs no stretch of imagination to reckon that such a document should exist in a truth account.<br><br>As to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Private Account No. (SPAN) 858,</span> SPAN 858 is yet another detail derived from a study of the documents and list furnished by the PDIC to the Office of the Ombudsman.

E-3 in the list.<br><br>It must be emphasized that this letter of authority dated November 23, 1999 authorized the release of more than <span style="font-weight: bold;">P100 Million</span> worth of manager's checks, where the ultimate recipient, for its deposit to the Jose Velarde account was, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Baby Ortaliza.</span> It must be recalled that prosecution witnesses Teresa Barcelona and Glyzelyn H. Bejec testified that it was Ortaliza who deposited the manager's checks subject of the letter of authority dated November 23, 1999 to the Jose Velarde account via Equitable PCIBank Greenhills Branch.<br><br>It must be recalled that plaintiff has presented voluminous evidence to establish beyond any doubt that Lucena "Baby" Ortaliza worked for accused Joseph Estrada in the Office of the Vice President, as testified to by prosecution witness Remedios Aguilar of the Office of the Vice President. The same fact is also shown by Exhibits "Y5," "Z5," "A6" (Ortaliza's appoint papers designating her as Vice-Presidential Staff Officer II signed by then Vice President Jose Estrada), "B6" (Certification of Employment), "C6" (Oath of Office), "D6" (Position Description Form), "E6" (Notice of Salary Adjustment) "F6" (Certification) and "G6" (Personal Data Sheet). Ortaliza also worked for accused Joseph Estrada at the Office of the President as testified to by witness Lita Sison of the Office of the President and as proved by Exhibits "I6" (Master Personnel Records File), "H6" (Registration letter of Ortaliza from the Office of the President), "J6" (Personnel Assessment Form), "K6" (appointment papers designating her as Presidential Staff Officer VI, Internal House, signed by then President Joseph Estrada), "L6" (Oath of Office), "M6" (Certification of Employment), "N6" (Position Description Form), "O6" (Personal Data Sheet) and "P6" (Ortaliza's public service record). The same "Baby" Ortaliza also transacted on behalf of former President Joseph Estrada with respect to his personal bank accounts. Indeed, Baby Ortaliza, as testified to by numerous prosecution witnesses and as shown by the documents they identified, is also the same person who transacted with Equitable PCIBank in connection with the Jose Velarde account and with Citibank in connection with the conjugal bank account of former President Joseph Estrada and Sen. Luisa Ejercito wherein the P8 Million check of Gov. Luis "Chavit" Singson was deposited. In addition to the foregoing and the testimonies of Clarissa Ocampo and Manuel Curato of Equitable PCIBank, the documents relating to Trust Account No. 858, thus, constitute further proof that accused Joseph Estrada is Jose Velarde.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Indeed, the surfacing of the name Baby Ortaliza in this Account No. 858 and her participation herein, coupled with the previous evidence presented as to who she worked for, all the more make Trust Account No. 858 not only relevant and material, but also the very subject matter of litigation in the instant case. Indeed, her participation herein more than establishes a pattern of behavior, a custom, a <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi</span> among accused Joseph Estrada, herself and the other co-accused in appearing for, representing, accused Joseph Estrada and transacting with respect to his bank accounts.</span><br><br>As to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Letter of Authority dated January 17, 2000 re SPAN 858,</span> it is document no.

The various sources included reports, articles and investigative journals, which are legitimate sources.<br><br>The other details were gathered upon compliance by the PDIC and/or Urban Bank with the subpoenas issued by the Office of the Ombudsman <span style="font-style: italic;">prior</span> to the promulgation by the Court of <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez. </span> The Office of the Ombudsman, in issuing the subpoenas relied on Section 15(8) of RA 6770 giving it the power "to issue subpoena and <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena duces tecum</span> and take testimony in any investigation or inquiry, including the power to examine and have access to bank accounts and records."<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span> ruling, it bears reiterating, came <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the subpoenas were issued by the Office of the Ombudsman and the PDIC and Urban Bank had already complied therewith by furnishing it the necessary information. The said information cannot thus be considered "illegal" because <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez,</span> which applied and interpreted the power of the Office of the Ombudsman under Section 15(8) of RA 6770, cannot be given retroactive application. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Filoteo, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court emphasized that "judge-made" laws are to be applied prospectively:<br><blockquote>The prospective application of "judge-made" laws was underscored in <span style="font-style: italic;">Co v. Court of Appeals</span> where the Court ruled thru Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa that in accordance with Article 8 of the Civil Code which provides that "(j)udicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines," and Article 4 of the same Code which states that "(l)aws shall have no retroactive effect unless the contrary is provided," the principle of prospectivity of statutes, original or amendatory, shall apply to judicial decisions, which, although in themselves are not laws, are nevertheless evidence of what the law means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Contrary to the petitioner's contention, therefore, the "extremely-detailed" information of the Office of the Ombudsman on which it based its requests for <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span> can hardly be characterized as "illegal." In any case, even if <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span> were to be given retroactive application, still, the crux of the Court's ruling in the said case has no application to the present case. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez, </span>the Court disallowed the Ombudsman from conducting an <span style="font-style: italic;">in camera</span> inspection of the bank account because "there was no pending case in court which would warrant the opening of the bank account for inspection."<br><br>On the other hand, it is indubitable that in the present case, the plunder and illegal use of alias cases against former President Estrada are pending before the Sandiganbayan and, unlike in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez,</span> the Special Prosecution Panel has asked leave of court in accordance with RA 1405 for the production of the said documents. Consequently, the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span> issued by the Sandiganbayan are allowable exceptions to the bank secrecy laws as they properly fall under the following categories in Section 2 thereof:<br><blockquote>(5) Upon order of a competent court in cases of bribery or dereliction of duty of public officials; or<br><br>(6) In cases where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Finally, the petitioner has sought to suppress the "extremely-detailed" information that the Special Prosecution Panel has requested. He invokes his constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizures and that any evidence obtained in violation thereof shall be inadmissible in evidence.  In her concurring and dissenting opinion, Mme. Justice Angelina Sandoval-Gutierrez agrees with petitioner JV Ejercito as she supports his plea to quash the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span> issued by the Sandiganbayan characterizing them as "unreasonable and oppressive" for being based on information allegedly obtained in violation of his constitutional right to privacy.<br><br>To my mind, the application of the exclusionary rule or the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine is not warranted in the present case not only because, as discussed earlier, there is no "illegally obtained evidence" to speak of but also because nowhere is it stated in RA 1405, and even in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marquez</span>, that a violation thereof warrants application of the exclusionary rule. Section 5 of RA 1405 provides that "[a]ny violation of this law will subject the offender upon conviction, to an imprisonment of not more than five years or a fine of not more than twenty thousand pesos or both, in the discretion of the court."<br><br>Interestingly, the United States has the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, unlike RA 1405, the US BSA was precisely enacted by the US Congress as a means of providing federal law investigators with an effective tool to fight criminal financial activity:<br><blockquote>The conclusion reached by Congress in the early hearings was summarized by Robert Morgenthau, U.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York, "Secret numbered foreign bank accounts have become an ever increasing widespread and versatile tool for the evasion of our laws and regulations and for the commission of crimes by American citizens and for hiding the fruits of crimes already committed.<br><br>This wave of criminal activity is fostered by the failure of fairly complete criminal investigations to ripen into prosecutions because there has been no disclosure of the real parties in interest; investigators cannot point to any particular individual. Even if identity is revealed, the evidence remains inadmissible hearsay. Most modern secrecy law prohibits the banker from coming forth with the disclosure. Thus, the prosecution lacks the competent and qualified business representative who could state evidence of account information as a business records exception to the hearsay rule.<br><br>In response to the public outcry over this reported criminal activity and as a means of providing federal law investigators with an effective investigative tool, Congress enacted the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The important feature of the BSA is its regulatory structure that is designed to be used as an investigative tool in the fight against white collar crime, and its passage is a broad delegation of commerce power to the Treasury Department. Title I thereof authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury Department to require financial institutions to record vast amounts of information on financial transactions. Title II provides a regulatory access to information via required reporting by the financial institutions and expressly authorized governmental interagency exchange of the accessed information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">California Bankers Association v. Schulz,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the US Supreme Court held that the BSA is a constitutionally valid and proper regulatory device.   In <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Miller,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the US Supreme Court reaffirmed its stance by holding that government access to a customer account records is not an unreasonable search and seizure even if realized through defective legal process and without customer notification.<br><br>Miller was convicted of operating an illegal still, functioning as a distiller without having posted bond, and committing tax evasion. The convictions were based on evidence subpoenaed pursuant to the BSA. Miller moved to suppress the bank records on the grounds that they were obtained by means of a defective <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena duces tecum</span> which resulted in a seizure violative of the fourth amendment.<br><br>The US Supreme Court held that Miller had no "protectable" fourth amendment interest in the subpoenaed documents. Justice Powell, speaking for the US Supreme Court, reasoned that the subpoenaed documents were not Millers "private papers" and that he could assert neither ownership nor possession. Rather, these were the business records of the bank.<br><br>The said Court also debunked Miller's claim that he had a legitimate "expectation of privacy" concerning the contents of the bank documents,<span style="font-style: italic;"> e.g.</span>, checks and deposit slips:<br><blockquote>Even if we direct our attention to the original checks and deposit slips, rather than to the microfilm copies actually viewed and obtained by means of the subpoena, we perceive no legitimate "expectation of privacy" in their contents. The checks are not confidential communications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions. All of the documents obtained, including financial statements and deposit slips, contain only information voluntarily conveyed to the banks and exposed to their employees in the ordinary course of business. The lack of any legitimate expectation of privacy concerning the information kept in bank records was assumed by Congress in enacting the Bank Secrecy Act, the express purpose of which is to require records to be maintained because they "have a high degree of usefulness in criminal tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings."<br><br>The depositor takes the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the information will be conveyed by that person to the Government. The Court has held repeatedly that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Because the customer had no "protectable" fourth amendment rights, according to the US Supreme Court, the case was controlled by the general rule that a subpoena issued to a third party, for that party's records, does not violate the rights of the third party's client.<br><br>Largely in response to <span style="font-style: italic;">Miller</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">California Bankers,</span> the US Congress enacted the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (RFPA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It enumerates the legal processes available for federal agency access to customer's account information. Access is conditioned upon one of the following procedures: customer authorization,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> administrative subpoena or summons,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> search warrant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> judicial subpoena,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> grand jury subpoena,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or formal written agency request.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Case law provides, however, that a violation of the procedures set forth in RFPA does not warrant exclusion of the evidence obtained because courts should not imply a suppression remedy unless the statute expressly refers to the exclusionary rule. The RFPA states that civil penalties are the only authorized remedy for its violation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Frazin,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> for example, Frazin and Miller were charged with mail and wire fraud. During its investigation, banks furnished the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) information about the account of Frazin without his knowledge or consent and without warrant. Frazin sought to suppress the bank records and other information obtained in violation of RFPA. The United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held against Frazin ratiocinating that had Congress intended to authorize a suppression remedy, it surely would have included it among the remedies it expressly authorized. The said US appellate court likewise refused to suppress the financial evidence pursuant to its supervisory powers over the administration of justice. It opined that "because the statute, when properly construed, excludes a suppression remedy, it would not be appropriate for us to provide one in the exercise of our supervisory powers over the administration of justice. Where Congress has both established a right and provided exclusive remedies for its violation, we would encroach upon the prerogatives of Congress where we to authorize a remedy not provided for by the statute."<br><br>The said ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Frazin</span> was reiterated by the US Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, in<span style="font-style: italic;"> United States v. Daccarett,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a civil forfeiture proceeding instituted by the United States Government against monies of Cali cartel, a Colombian conglomerate headed by Jose Santacruz-Londono, which allegedly imported 3000 kilograms of cocaine a month into the US. The cartel allegedly used bank accounts throughout the US, Europe, Central and South America to store and move its narcotic proceeds. Funds were moved through various international banks by means of electronic fund transfers for ultimate deposit into Colombian bank accounts.<br><br>Several associates of Santacruz-Londono were arrested in Luxembourg. Anticipating that the arrests would trigger an effort by the cartel to move its monies to Colombia, the Luxembourg law enforcement authorities requested the assistance of several countries to freeze monies related to the cartel. The US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) instructed intermediary banks in New York to attach "all funds" on deposit in the names of entities and individuals connected with Santacruz-Londono. The DEA also subpoenaed from the intermediary banks financial records of related accounts.<br><br>The entities and individuals who claimed to be the beneficiaries of the seized funds argued, among others, that their fourth amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures were violated when the government gained access to their financial records from the intermediary banks without a warrant. They contended that evidence obtained from the subpoenas should have been suppressed at trial. The US appellate court, in rejecting this argument, cited <span style="font-style: italic;">Frazin</span> and succinctly held that "because the RFPA states that civil penalties are the only authorized remedy for its violation, it would be inappropriate for the courts to imply a suppression remedy as well."<br><br>Also in <span style="font-style: italic;">United States v. Thompson,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the US Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit, made the following disquisition:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he defendant would have to show that Congress had provided such a remedy for a violation of the statute, either specifically or by inference. Clearly Congress intended to place limits on the Government's ability to monitor the private activities of individuals when it passed this statute. Congress did not, however, suggest that any information obtained in violation of the statute's provisions should be excluded. Instead the statute only provides for fines and possible imprisonment for knowing violations. When Congress specifically designates a remedy for one of its acts, courts generally presume that it engaged in the necessary balancing of interests in determining what the appropriate penalty should be. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Absent a specific reference to the exclusionary rule, it is not appropriate for the courts to read such a provision into the act.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>Under prevailing jurisprudence in the United States therefore, violations of the RFPA do not warrant the application of the exclusionary rule with respect to the evidence obtained.<br><br>Nonetheless, in the present case, there is no violation of RA 1405 precisely because petitioner JV Ejercito's case properly falls under the recognized exceptions to the rule on confidentiality of bank deposits. Further, the Special Prosecution Panel has properly requested the Sandiganbayan for the issuance of the <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoenae duces tecum/ad testificandum</span> for the production of documents relating to the bank accounts of petitioner JV Ejercito in connection with the plunder and illegal use of alias cases against former President Estrada.
