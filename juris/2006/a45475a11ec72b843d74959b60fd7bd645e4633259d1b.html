Delay in the disposition of cases undermines the people's faith and confidence in the judiciary. Hence, judges are enjoined to decide cases with dispatch.

The judge, as the person presiding over that court, is the visible representation of the law and justice. These are self-evident dogmas which do not even have to be emphasized, but to which we are wont to advert when some members of the judiciary commit legal missteps or stray from the axioms of judicial ethics. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Failure to resolve cases submitted for decision within the period fixed by law constitutes a serious violation of the constitutional right of the parties to a speedy disposition of their cases. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  Rule 1.02, Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct states in no uncertain terms that a judge should administer justice impartially and <span style="font-style: italic;">without delay</span> while Rule 3.05, Canon 3 requires the judge to dispose of the court's business <span style="font-style: italic;">promptly</span> and decide cases <span style="font-style: italic;">within the required periods.</span><br><br>The Court has laid down administrative guidelines to ensure that the mandates on the prompt disposition of judicial business are complied with. Thus, SC Administrative Circular No. 13-87 states, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that:<br><blockquote>The reorganized judiciary is tasked with the tremendous responsibility of assisting parties litigants in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of their cases and proceedings as directed in Rule 1, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Delay is a recurring complaint of every litigant. <span style="font-style: italic;">The main objective of every judge, particularly of trial judges, should be to avoid delays,</span> or if it cannot be totally avoided, to hold them to the minimum and to repudiate manifestly dilatory tactics.<br><br>GENERAL GUIDELINES<br><br>For all members of the judiciary, the following guidelines are hereby issued:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Judges shall observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15, of the Constitution for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts. </span>Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts while all other lower courts are given a period of three months to do so. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>Along the same vein, SC Administrative Circular No. 1-88 states that:<br><blockquote>Pursuant to Sec. 12, Art. XVIII of the 1987 Constitution mandating the adoption of a systematic plan to expedite the decision or resolution of cases or matters pending in the Supreme Court and the lower courts prior to the effectivity of the Constitution on February 2, 1987, the following directives must be complied with strictly by all concerned.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Motions and Other Interlocutory Matters:</span><br><br>6.1 All Presiding Judges must endeavor to <span style="font-style: italic;">act promptly </span>on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts.</blockquote>The records show that Judge Emuslan failed to decide the cases submitted for decision and to resolve pending incidents and motions, despite the lapse of more than a year since he was directed to comply.  The excuses he proffered to explain his tardiness are not satisfactory.  If respondent judge felt that he could not decide the cases or the pending incidents within the reglementary period, he should have asked for extension of time to dispose of the same. This Court, cognizant of the caseload of judges and mindful of the difficulty encountered by them in the seasonable disposition of cases, have always granted requests for extension of time to decide. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>What aggravates the malfeasance of Judge Emuslan is his refusal to heed the directives of the OCA to submit proof of his compliance. His prolonged and repeated refusal to comply constitutes a clear and willful disrespect for lawful orders of the OCA.  It has been stressed that it is through the OCA that the Supreme Court exercises supervision over all lower courts and personnel thereof. At the core of the judge's esteemed position is obedience to the dictates of the law and justice. A judge must be the first to exhibit respect for authority. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Judge Emuslan failed in this aspect when he repeatedly ignored the lawful orders of the OCA.<br><br>A resolution of the Supreme Court is not be construed as a mere request nor should it be complied with partially, inadequately or selectively. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the light of the prevailing facts of this case, we find that a fine of P20,000.00 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> is commensurate under the circumstances.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> Judge Meliton G.
