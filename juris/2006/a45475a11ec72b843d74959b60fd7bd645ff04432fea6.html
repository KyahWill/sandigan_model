Further execution proceeding shall follow after determining some real and personal properties of defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Respecting his failure to submit periodic reports every 30 days, Diamla explained:<br><blockquote>x x x Periodic report was stopped due to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">failure of the plaintiff to replenish execution expenses</span> required of them.  In fact, Atty. Dibaratun informed the respondent thru a letter that he is a<span style="text-decoration: underline;">sking for the deferment of the continuation of execution because his client Rosa Maria Lamparas ran away </span>from her parents' home and could not be located despite diligent efforts exerted by the relatives.  He further informed the undersigned respondent that they will file pleadings/manifestation to continue execution as soon as his client will re-appear or be located alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>To bolster his explanation, he attached as Annex "O"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Ex-Parte Notice to Defer Execution dated July 21, 2003 filed by complainant's counsel Atty. Macarupung B. Dibaratun.<br><br>For his part, Aliponto, in his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> disclaimed any participation in the February 10 and 11, 2005 proceedings, alleging that it was only on April 4, 2003 that he and Diamla went to Oroquieta City when he issued Notice of Levy and Notices of Garnishment to selected banks.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">OFFICE  OF  THE  COURT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ADMINISTRATOR'S  FINDINGS</span><br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) came up with the following evaluation of the case:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVALUATION:</span> Complainant failed to adduce proof to accurately show the true value of the properties sold on execution by the respondents. In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Florentino A. Caja vs. Atilano G. Nanquil (A.M. No. P-04-1885, 13 September 2004</span>), it was held that it is the duty of the complainant to show their true value as substantiated by competent proof. In the absence of contrary evidence, as in this case, the presumption prevails that the respondents regularly performed their official duties. Consequently, it could be presumed that the executed properties were sold at the public auction at the best price possible.<br><br>In any event, it has been held that when there is a right to redeem, inadequacy of price should not be material because the judgment debtor may re-acquire the property or else sell his right to redeem and thus recover any loss he claims to have suffered by reason of the price obtained at the execution sale. Mere inadequacy of the price obtained at the sheriff's sale unless shocking to the conscience will not be sufficient to set aside the sale if there is no showing that, in the event of a regular sale, a better price can be obtained. This [is] based on the theory that the less the price, the easier it will be for the owner to effect the redemption (<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Development Bank of the Philippines vs. Vda. de Moll, 43 SCRA 82</span>).<br><br>In regard to the presence of armed men during the execution, respondent Diamla clarifies that they are elements of the PNP who, upon request, escorted him from Marawi City to Oroquieta City. They also assisted him during the execution. These escorts coordinated with the Oroquieta PNP announcing their presence thereat. It bears emphasis that sheriffs, in the performance of their functions, are not prohibited by the rules from seeking assistance from appropriate police officers. Absent any proof of grave abuse of authority, respondent Diamla cannot be faulted for seeking assistance from the PNP to ensure an orderly and peaceful implementation of the writ.<br><br>Respondents did not deny that no periodic report was made to the court after the writ of execution was returned partially satisfied. In defense, respondent Diamla claimed that the plaintiff's lawyer in an ex-parte notice dated 21 July 2003 asked them to defer the execution proceedings. However, respondents alone, without any court order, cannot defer the execution of the court's judgment. The <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> notice is not an excuse for their failure to submit the periodic report to the court. The rule is clear that a sheriff tasked with the implementation of the writ of execution must proceed with reasonable dispatch to execute it and to make a return immediately. If it is not satisfied, he must make a report to the court stating the reason for the failure of execution within thirty days after his receipt of the writ and make a report every 30 days thereafter until the judgment is satisfied <span style="font-style: italic;">(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Casaje vs. Gatbalite, 331 SCRA 508; Viray vs. Court of Appeals, 286 SCRA 468; Jumio vs. Egay-Eviota, 231 SCRA 551)</span></span>.<br><br>Respondents' failure to make the periodic report amounts to simple neglect of duty which is defined as the failure to give proper attention to a task expected of an employee resulting from either carelessness or indifference <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(Villanueva-Fabella vs. Lee, A.M. No. MTJ-04-1518, 14 January 2004). </span>It is a less grave offense under CSC Resolution No. 99-1936 dated 31 August 1999 that carries the penalty of suspension from work for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months, for the first offense and dismissal, for the second offense.<br><br>Parenthetically, aside from the instant complaint, there are other administrative complaints against the respondents. Respondent Palao M. Diamla is charged with grave abuse of discretion in OCA IPI No. 04-1869-P; while respondent Acmad C. Aliponto is charged with gross misconduct and dereliction of duty in OCA IPI No. 05-2232-P, and with grave misconduct in OCA IPI No. 04-2104-RTJ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>The OCA accordingly recommended that respondents be suspended from office for a period of One Month and One Day without pay, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">THIS COURT'S FINDINGS</span><br><br>Respondent Diamla's explanation on his being accompanied by elements of the PNP with the coordination of the PNP in Oroquieta City may be credited. In the performance of their functions, sheriffs are not prohibited from seeking assistance from police officers.<br><br>As to the alleged levying of properties of complainant on top of those previously levied and auctioned, respondents' explanation that they relied on the values of the auctioned properties reflected in their respective Tax Declarations is well-taken.<br><br>Respondents cannot escape administrative liability, however, for their failure to make periodic reports on the status of the Writ.  Section 14 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court explicitly mandates compliance with the manner in which a writ of execution is to be returned to the court, as well as the submission of periodic reports every 30 days until the judgment is fully satisfied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the reason behind which being to update the court on the status of the execution so it could take necessary steps to ensure its speedy satisfaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The filing of an Ex-Parte Notice to Defer Execution by complainant's counsel invoked by respondents to justify their failure to submit periodic reports does not lie.  Without a court order, they cannot defer the execution of the court's judgment.<br><blockquote>A sheriff's duty in the execution of a writ is purely ministerial; he is to execute the order of the court strictly to the letter. He has no discretion whether to execute the judgment or not. He is mandated to uphold the majesty of the law as embodied in the decision. When a writ is placed in the hands of a sheriff, it is his duty, in the absence of any instructions to the contrary, to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to execute it according to its mandate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, respondents are guilty of simple neglect of duty, defined as "the failure of an employee to give one's attention to a task expected of him, and signifies a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> this Court finds respondents Sheriffs Palao M.
