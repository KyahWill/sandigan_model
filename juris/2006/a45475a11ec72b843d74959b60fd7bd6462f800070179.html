Contrary to the allegation of the defendant, her action was not a real action; hence, she need not allege the assessed value of the property. &nbsp;In any event, even if the amount she paid as docket fees was insufficient, she should be allowed a reasonable time to pay the deficiency. She further claimed that the liquidation of their conjugal partnership properties is not a condition precedent to the filing of her complaint because her action is against defendant, a third party who is an outsider to her husband's estate.&nbsp; Moreover, her claimed right to a declaration of a constructive trust in her favor to enable her to sell her 50% conjugal partnership share in the proceeds of the sale is not a violation of the Constitution.&nbsp; She pointed out that when a favorable judgment is rendered in her favor, she would still be compelled to sell the property to a qualified Filipino. &nbsp;Thus, the court's mere declaration of Bancorp as trustee is not prohibited by the Constitution.&nbsp; She further alleged that Bancorp was estopped from raising such a defense against her based on the doctrine of <i>pari delicto.</i><br><br>On January 20, 1996, the RTC issued an Order denying the motion of Bancorp,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> prompting it to file a motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on the following grounds:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div>WITH DUE RESPECT, THE PERFUNCTORY DENIAL OF DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE ORDER DATED 20 JANUARY 1998 VIOLATES SECTION 3, RULE 16 OF THE 1997 REVISED RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AS IT FAILED TO STATE CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY THE REASONS THEREFOR.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div>WITH DUE RESPECT, THE ORDER DATED 20 JANUARY 1998 DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF DUE PROCESS CONSIDERING THAT ITS RIGHT TO FILE A REPLY TO PLAINTIFF'S OPPOSITION DATED 14 JANUARY 1998 WHICH WAS GRANTED TO DEFENDANT IN A PREVIOUS ORDER DATED 05 DECEMBER 1997 WAS ARBITRARILY CURTAILED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div>WITH DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE COURT SHOULD RECONSIDER AND SET ASIDE THE ORDER DATED 20 JANUARY 1998 AND INSTEAD ORDER THE DISMISSAL OF THE INSTANT CASE, CONSIDERING THAT:<ol type="A"><li>THE COMPLAINT STATES NO CAUSE OF ACTION FOR THE DECLARATION OF PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGED FIFTY PERCENT UNDIVIDED INTEREST OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTY SINCE SUCH A CLAIM BY AN ALIEN IS PROSCRIBED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.</li><br><li>ASSUMING THAT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY BELONGS TO THE ALLEGED CONJUGAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN PLAINTIFF AND THE LATE DONALD C.

Lightner, Jr. &nbsp;The relief prayed for in the complaint dated 08 October 1997 is premised on an alleged right of ownership being claimed by the plaintiff as a consequence of the alleged acquisition of the Subject Property purportedly using the conjugal funds of the plaintiff and the late Donald C. Lightner, Jr., who are both aliens. &nbsp;Consequently, it is clear from the allegations in the Complaint that plaintiff traces her alleged right to the Subject Property to an unlawful conveyance which is clearly proscribed under the Constitution.<br><br>"Section 7, Article XII of the Constitution categorically provides the following prohibition:<blockquote>Sec. 7. Save in cases of hereditary succession, no private lands shall be transferred or conveyed except to individuals, corporations, or associations qualified to acquire lands of the public domain."</blockquote>Accordingly, while plaintiff is ostensibly asking for a mere declaration of plaintiff's alleged fifty percent (50%) undivided interest over the Subject Property as stated in the prayer of the Complaint dated 08 October 1997, plaintiff in reality is demanding the declaration of the Subject Property as owned jointly by her and the estate of the late Donald C. Lightner, Jr. which is clearly prohibited under the Constitution.<br><br>Plaintiff, who is an alien, cannot even assert a claim for a fifty percent (50%) undivided interest over the Subject Property as her alleged conjugal share.<br><br>Plaintiff states that liquidation of the conjugal partnership in the estate proceeding is not a precedent for the filing of the suit.<br><br>It has been held that the declaration of a fifty percent (50%) undivided interest over a parcel of land is tantamount to the conferment of absolute title thereto, including the right to dispose and convey title to said property. &nbsp;As held in the case of <i>Meralco v. Viardo</i>, 5 SCRA 859-868 (1962):<blockquote>x x x&nbsp; The other one-half undivided interest of the latter was not in litigation and therefore the trial court correctly held that Pilar Belmonte, as the owner of this undivided one-half interest, had a right to sell it and convey absolute title thereto or to parts thereof.&nbsp; x x x</blockquote>In the case of <i>Suyon v. Collantes</i>, 69 SCRA 514-520 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that in determining whether a Complaint sufficiently states a cause of action, assuming the truth of the allegations of fact therein, the Honorable Court should first determine whether it could render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer in the Complaint. &nbsp;In the instant case, plaintiff prays that she be declared the owner of the fifty percent (50%) undivided interest in the Subject Property. For the Court to render judgment in favor of plaintiff as prayed for in her Complaint, it is enough that the Subject Property be shown to belong to her and the late Donald C. Lightner, Jr. &nbsp;It must also be established that she is qualified under the Constitution and our laws to own or hold the interest she claims in the Subject Property. In the instant case, the very allegations of her Complaint show that she is disqualified, being an alien, from being declared the owner of fifty percent (50%) undivided interest in the Subject Property.&nbsp; For this reason, plaintiff's Complaint clearly states no cause of action.<br><br>Plaintiff alleges that the conjugal partnership must be liquidated in an estate proceeding applies only when the suit is filed against the estate for the recovery of a specific asset or property. &nbsp;It does not apply to a suit against a third party who is an outsider to the estate. &nbsp;In this action, plaintiff has sued a third party to declare it as holding title to the property in constructive trust for plaintiff.<br><br>Defendant, however, states that, Article 129 of the Family Code (Executive Order 209), the conjugal partnership must first be liquidated before the plaintiff can assert her alleged claim to any specific conjugal partnership asset because it is in the liquidation of the alleged conjugal partnership that a determination is made as to which properties pertain to the conjugal partnership and what constitutes the net remainder thereof to which the surviving spouse may become entitled.<br><br>That prior to the liquidation, plaintiff cannot assert ownership over specific conjugal assets. &nbsp;What the plaintiff will eventually become entitled to would be the net remainder of the alleged conjugal partnership after the payment of all the debts and obligations of the alleged conjugal partnership and the distribution of the exclusive paraphernal properties of each of the spouses.<br><br>In the instant case, even before the alleged conjugal partnership could be liquidated pursuant to Article 129 of the Family Code, plaintiff is already asserting a claim to her alleged conjugal share over a specific conjugal property, on the erroneous assumption that Subject Property supposedly constitutes conjugal property. &nbsp;Clearly, plaintiff's claim over the subject property, even assuming the same to be conjugal, is premature as she can only be entitled to the net remainder of the alleged conjugal partnership under the law. &nbsp;At present, the net remainder of the alleged partnership has not yet been determined considering that the condition precedent of liquidating the alleged conjugal partnership has yet to be complied with. Thus, plaintiff cannot assert her alleged claim for a supposed fifty (50%) undivided interest over the Subject Property which she claims to be part of the conjugal partnership assets.<br><br>Considering the foregoing discussions, this Court finds it is no longer necessary to discuss further the remaining issues raised by both parties as it is the opinion of this Court that the above mentioned contention would be sufficient enough for this Court to finally determine the assertion of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Lightner filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing that the questioned order is contrary to the relevant facts and the applicable law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> &nbsp;For its part, Bancorp filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that:<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT HAS NO JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE INSTANT APPEAL WHICH INVOLVES PURE QUESTIONS OF LAW AND IS PROPERLY COGNIZABLE BY THE SUPREME COURT; HENCE, THE INSTANT APPEAL SHOULD BE DISMISSED OUTRIGHT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Lightner opposed the Motion to Dismiss Appeal, claiming that her appeal involved both questions of law and questions of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On October 19, 2000, the CA resolved to deny the Motion to Dismiss Appeal filed by Bancorp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> &nbsp;The latter received a copy of the resolution on October 30, 2000, and moved for its reconsideration on November 13, 2000.<br><br>Lightner opposed the motion, insisting that questions of fact or law may be raised on appeal to the CA by writ of error. She maintained that Bancorp indulged in speculations when it averred in its Motion to Dismiss the Appeal that her appeal would only raise questions of law, that such an argument would have no basis until the issues have actually been delineated and the assignment of errors stated in her brief as appellant.<br><br>Meanwhile, Lightner filed her Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 22, 2001 in which she averred that:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div>The lower court erred in finding that the complaint states no cause of action.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div>The lower court erred in finding that the complaint was filed prematurely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>Bancorp filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that only legal issues had been raised in the appellant's brief, hence, the appeal should be dismissed.<br><br>On March 21, 2001, the appellate court resolved to deny the motion for reconsideration of its October 19, 2000 Resolution filed by Bancorp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> &nbsp;The CA held that under Section 15, Rule 44 of the Rules of Court, the appellant may raise either questions of fact or law.<br><br>On October 26, 2001, the CA denied the Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration filed by Bancorp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> &nbsp;The latter received a copy of this resolution on November 16, 2001, and thereafter filed its Brief as appellee <i>ad cautelam</i> in the CA, alleging that<blockquote><ol type="I"><li>The Honorable Court Has No Jurisdiction To Take Cognizance Of The Instant Appeal Which Involves Pure Questions Of Law And Is Properly Cognizable By The Supreme Court; Hence, The Instant Appeal Should Be Dismissed Outright.</li><br><li>Assuming <i>Arguendo</i> That The Honorable Court Has Jurisdiction Over The Instant Appeal, The Trial Court Correctly Ruled That Plaintiff-Appellant Lightner's Complaint States No Cause Of Action For The Declaration Of Her Alleged Fifty Percent Undivided Interest Over The Subject Property Since Such A Claim By An Alien Is Proscribed Under The Constitution; And Hence, Should Be Dismissed.</li><br><li>The Trial Court Correctly Ruled That Plaintiff-Appellant Lightner's Complaint Was Prematurely Filed And, Hence, Should Be Dismissed Considering That Even Assuming That The Subject Property Belongs To The Alleged Conjugal Partnership Between Plaintiff-Appellant Lightner And The Late Donald C.

Rico General Insurance Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and <i>PCGG v.

Where a record on appeal is required, the appellant shall file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order.<br><br>The period of appeal shall be interrupted by a timely motion for new trial or reconsideration. No motion for extension of time to file a motion for new trial or reconsideration shall be allowed.</blockquote>Under Section 5 of the same rule, "the notice of appeal shall indicate the parties to the appeal, specify the judgment or final order or part thereof appealed from, specify the court to which the appeal is being taken, and state the material dates showing the timeliness of the appeal."<br><br>On the other hand, an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> is via a petition for review to be filed with the Supreme Court within fifteen (15) days from notice of the final order or resolution appealed from or of the dismissal of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the final order or resolution:<blockquote>Section 1. <i>Filing of petition with Supreme Court</i>. - A party desiring to appeal by <i>certiorari</i> from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; The petition shall raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>If the aggrieved party appeals by writ of error under Rule 41 of the Rules of Court to the CA and it turns out, from the brief of appellant, that only questions of law are raised, the appeal shall be dismissed:<blockquote>Sec. 2.&nbsp; <i>Dismissal of improper appeal to the Court of Appeals</i>. - An appeal under Rule 41 taken from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals raising only questions of law shall be dismissed, issues purely of law not being reviewable by said court.&nbsp;

<i>Questions that may be raised on appeal</i>. - Whether or not the appellant has filed a motion for new trial in the court below, he may include in his assignment of errors any question of law or fact that has been raised in the court below and which is within the issues framed by the parties.</blockquote>This rule, however, does not relate to the nature of the issues that may be raised on appeal by the aggrieved party, whether issues of fact or issues of law, or the mode of appeal of the aggrieved party from a final order or resolution of the trial court in the exercise of its original jurisdiction; it merely provides the nature of the issues appellant may include in his assignment of error incorporated in his Brief as appellant. &nbsp;It may happen that the appellant may have raised in the trial court errors of fact or law or both, and need not include all said issues in his appeal in the appellate court. &nbsp;The appellant has the right to choose which issues of law he or she may raise in the CA in addition to factual issues already raised.<br><br>A question of fact exists when a doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsity of alleged facts. &nbsp;If the query requires a reevaluation of the credibility of witnesses or the existence or relevance of surrounding circumstances and their relation to each other, the issue in that query is factual. &nbsp;On the other hand, there is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on certain state of facts and which does not call for an existence of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties-litigants. &nbsp;In a case involving a question of law, the resolution of the issue rests solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> &nbsp;Ordinarily, the determination of whether an appeal involves only questions of law or both questions of law and fact is best left to the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> &nbsp;All doubts as to the correctness of the conclusions of the appellate court will be resolved in favor of the CA unless it commits an error or commits a grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the present case, respondent appealed the order of the trial court, which dismissed her complaint on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action against petitioner (defendant therein), and for prematurity, as the conjugal partnership between her and her deceased husband had not yet been liquidated prior to its filing.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that the trial court acted in accord with law when it dismissed the complaint. While it admits that when it filed its motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint of respondent states no cause of action, it theoretically admitted the truth of the factual and material allegations in the complaint and not mere inferences or conclusions from facts not stated; nor conclusions of law; nor matters of evidence; nor surplusage and irrelevant matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner agrees that the court may not inquire into the truth of the allegations and find them to be false before a hearing is had on the merits of the case; and it is improper to inject in the allegations of the complaint facts not alleged or proved, and use these as basis for said motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; The test of the sufficiency of the facts alleged in the complaint is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged, the court can render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the prayer of plaintiff. &nbsp;A complaint may also be dismissed for failure of plaintiff to comply with a condition precedent. &nbsp;There can be no cause of action for filing a complaint in court unless the condition precedent has been complied with. &nbsp;Performance or fulfillment of all conditions precedent whether proscribed by statement or by agreement of the parties or implied by law upon which a right of action depends must be sufficiently alleged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>With the foregoing premises, we agree with petitioner's contention that a question of whether or not a complaint states a cause of action against defendant or that the action is premature is one of law. &nbsp;The determination thereof is one of law and not of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Indeed, in <i>China Road and Bridge Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court ruled that:<blockquote>In a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a cause of action, there cannot be any question of fact or "doubt or difference as to the truth or falsehood of facts," simply because there are no findings of fact in the first place.&nbsp; What the trial court merely does is to apply the law to the facts as alleged in the complaint, assuming such allegations to be true. It follows then that any appeal therefrom could only raise questions of law or "doubt or controversy as to what the law is on a certain state of facts."&nbsp; Therefore, a decision dismissing a complaint based on failure to state a cause of action necessarily precludes a review of the same decision on questions of fact.&nbsp; One is the legal and logical opposite of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>The Court further ruled that a review of a finding of lack of cause of action based on the factual and material allegations of the complaint would only limit itself to whether the law was properly applied given the facts alleged in the complaint. &nbsp;What would inevitably arise from such a review are pure questions of law, and not questions of fact:<blockquote>JADEBANK in its <i>Appellant's Brief</i> raised the following questions, which it erroneously designated as questions of fact, in an attempt to place its appeal within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals:<blockquote>4.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the amended complaint together with the Annexes attached and forming an integral part thereof, states a sufficient cause of action against the defendant-appellee;<br><br>4.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not there was an unwarranted reversal of the Honorable Regional Trial Court's Orders stating that the complaint states a sufficient cause of action;<br><br>4.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the Motion to Dismiss the complaint can be considered also as a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint.</blockquote>We fail to see how these issues raised by JADEBANK could be properly denominated questions of fact. The test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact.&nbsp; Applying the test to the instant case, it is clear that private respondent raises pure questions of law which are not proper in an ordinary appeal under Rule 41, but should be raised by way of a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45.<br><br>We agree with private respondent that in a motion to dismiss due to failure to state a cause of action, the trial court can consider all the pleadings filed, including annexes, motions and the evidence on record. However in so doing, the trial court does not rule on the truth or falsity of such documents. It merely includes such documents in the hypothetical admission. Any review of a finding of lack of cause of action based on these documents would not involve a calibration of the probative value of such pieces of evidence but would only limit itself to the inquiry of whether the law was properly applied given the facts and these supporting documents. Therefore, what would inevitably arise from such a review are pure questions of law, and not questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>Respondent cannot find solace in the ruling of this Court in <i>Heirs of Yaptinchay v. Del Rosario</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In that case, the trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground, <i>inter alia</i>, that it failed to state a cause of action and that plaintiffs had their right of action against defendants because they had not established their status as heirs. &nbsp;Instead of appealing the order of the court, plaintiff filed a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> in this Court under Rule 65. &nbsp;The Court dismissed the petition, declaring that the proper remedy was to appeal the order and not file a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>It must be stressed that an order of dismissal, be it right or wrong, is a final order which is subject to appeal, not the proper subject of <i>certiorari</i>. &nbsp;Where appeal is available as a remedy, <i>certiorari</i> will not lie. In <i>Meneses v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court reiterated the rule that:<blockquote>It must also be stressed that the trial court's order of 5 June 1992 dismissing the petitioner's complaint was, whether it was right or wrong, a final order because it had put an end to the particular matter resolved, or settled definitely the matter therein disposed of and left nothing more to be done by the trial court except the execution of the order.&nbsp; It is a firmly settled rule that the remedy against such order is the remedy of appeal and not <i>certiorari</i>.&nbsp; That appeal may be solely on questions of law, in which case it may be taken only to this Court; or on questions of fact and law, in which case the appeal should be brought to the Court of Appeals. Pursuant to <i>Murillo v. Consul</i>, the appeal to this Court should be by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In the instant case then, if the petitioner had chosen to appeal from the dismissal order of the trial court solely on questions of law, then he should have filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> with this Court. If he wanted to raise in his appeal both questions of law and of fact, then he should have pursued the remedy of an ordinary appeal to the Court of Appeals and not by way of a petition for review under Rule 45. The Court of Appeals did not then commit any reversible error when it dismissed the petition for review of the petitioner in CA-G.R. SP No. 29328.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>Thus, the appeal of respondent to the CA by writ of error is a wrong mode of appeal; consequently, the appeal should have been dismissed.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. &nbsp;The assailed Resolutions of the Court of Appeals are <b>SET ASIDE</b>. &nbsp;No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez,</i> and <i>Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 60-62.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 49-51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 51.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 63-64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 95.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 96-124.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 96-98.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 125-139.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 140-143.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 144-145.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 146.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 204-213.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 42-43.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 311-337.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 311-347.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 45.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Id. at 47-48.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Id. at 356-357.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Id. at 23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> G.R.
