Jaurigue, respondent's Hotel and Restaurant Manager for the Holland America Line Crewing Department. In said report, Mr. Jaurigue stated that although complainant may actually perform his former duties without any problem, [petitioners'] pre-employment screening doctors do not want to take the risk in certifying him fit for sea duty an[d] that should [petitioner] HAL agree to employ the subject, it will be at HAL's risk. The Labor Arbiter also held that since complainant's disability lasted more than 120 days, the same is sufficient basis to declare him permanently disabled. We do not agree. Records show that [petitioners'] company designated physician, Dr. Renato Abaya physically examined [respondent] sometime in March 1999, several months after the report of Mr. Jarigue was done. In this connection, said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dr.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abaya</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">issued</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">report dated</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1999</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stating</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[respondent]</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">good</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">health</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fit</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">work.

[Petitioners] contend they continued to shoulder the expenses for [respondent's] treatment and rehabilitation.  This was admitted by [respondent] in his Rejoinder when he recognized the financial assistance extended to him by [petitioners].  In this connection, the Labor Arbiter held that since [respondent's] disability lasted more than 120 days, there is sufficient basis to declare him disabled citing Aquino vs. ECC (201 SCRA 84).

The POEA benefits under said contract are separate and distinct from those benefits provided under the Employees Compensation Commission, the SSS or GSIS.  The provisions thereof should be the law between the contracting parties.<br><br>The foregoing circumstances being considered, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[respondent]</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">found to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cured</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">recovered</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his illness</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">determined</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">company designated</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">physician </span>as he was declared fit to work for the same job he held prior to his illness. The job was offered to complainant by respondents which is proof that he did not lose his earning capacity.<br><br>Accordingly, we deem it proper to delete the award of total disability benefit. However, [respondent] is not left holding an empty bag. In this connection, [petitioners] are directed to deploy [respondent] within a reasonable period to one of its foreign principal for the same position he held prior to his illness.<br><br>WHEREFORE,

style="font-weight: bold;">permanent</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">disability. </span></span> We cannot but agree with the [respondent] that with the proliferation of obviously biased company doctors whose loyalty rest completely upon the company they serve, their findings cannot be taken as gospel truth.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In Wallem Maritime Services v. NLRC,</span> [the] High Tribunal had this to say:<br><br>"x x x (The) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">opinion</span>s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioner's</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doctors</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">effect</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">given evidentiary</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weight</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">palpably</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-serving</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">biased in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">favor</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of petitioners,</span> and certainly could not be considered independent."<br><br>Under Bureau Circular No. 5, Series of 1990, issued by the Department of Health to medical clinics and hospitals accredited to conduct medical examination of overseas contract workers and seafarers, those with ECG findings like myocardial ischemia, [infarction], 2nd and 3rd degree AV Block and other grave manifestation xxx and other illnesses which render the worker unemployable should be classified as Class D or unemployable.<br><br>The circular leaves Us no choice but to conclude that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[respondent]</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">longer employable</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">considering</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kind</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of ailment</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffered</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continues</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffer.</span>  We give judicial notice to the fact that no one fully recovers from a massive heart attack, and a person who has had a heart condition and has already suffered a heart attack is in danger of another attack anytime and absent any warning.  [Respondent] therefore cannot be blamed if he is more cautious about his health and has become loathe to be deployed again. It should be remembered that [respondent] here is already 53 years old and has undergone a triple bypass operation during the term of his contract.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">His</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">medical</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">condition</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">renders</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">him unemployable</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cook</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seafaring</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">vessel.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">important</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">note</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tha</span>t <span style="text-decoration: underline;">such ailment</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been, in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">probability,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contracted</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">during</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">employment</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with [petitioner].</span>  And being such, he should not have been issued a work certification by company designated. His disability persists up to this very day and there is no showing that by some miracle, he has fully recovered from his ailment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In Wallem Maritime Services, Inc. v. NLRC, </span>the Supreme Court had occasion to rule:<blockquote>"The POEA Standard Employment Contract is designed primarily for the protection and benefit of Filipino seamen in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels. Its provisions must, therefore, be construed and applied fairly, reasonably and liberally in favor or for the benefit of the seamen and their dependents.  Only then can its beneficent provisions can be fully carried into effect."<br></blockquote>It is meet to point out that the Standard Employment Contract is not a limitation but a guaranteed protection to overseas contract workers.<br><br>4. That having been said, We find and so hold that there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessity</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for petitioner</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seek</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">opinion</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">third</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doctor</span> pursuant to his employment contract, as it is very clear that it is not possible for [respondent] to go back to work. We take judicial knowledge of the fact that a cook's job is not exactly a walk in the park. A cook is exposed to constant heat and smoke, and the job may entail laborious manual tasks. In the case at bench, there is no disputing that [respondent] suffered a massive heart attack while pushing a rack of glass. What makes the job all the more difficult is that it is conducted in a moving ship, which makes for increased work-related stress. All these factors may exacerbate [respondent's] heart condition and expose him to the possibility of another attack. [Respondent's] refusal to go back to work and instead claim permanent disability benefits could not thus be considered unreasonable and impelled by nothing but greed but rather,  justified by [respondent's] health considerations and a natural desire of every person to preserve his life for as long as possible. For being human, [respondent] should not be penalized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the present petition was filed faulting the appellate court in<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">A.<br></div><br>x x x FINDING THAT RESPONDENT'S PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WAS SUFFICIENT IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 1, RULE 65 OF THE 1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">B.<br></div><br>. . . AWARDING PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS TO RESPONDENT IN LIGHT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE POEA STANDARD CONTRACT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">C.<br></div><br>. . . APPLYING THE "<span style="font-style: italic;">THIRD DOCTOR CLAUSE"</span> OF THE POEA STANDARD CONTRACT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">D.<br></div><br>. . . FINDING THAT THE "RELEASE AND QUITCLAIM" EXECUTED AND SIGNED BY RESPONDENT IS NOT PROOF THAT THE LATTER HAS RECEIVED ALL BENEFITS TO WHICH HE IS ENTITLED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners argue that, among other things, the provisions on disability benefits operate only upon certification by the company-designated physician that the claiming seafarer is indeed disabled, hence, respondent is not eligible for an award of disability benefits as "he was certified fit for sea duty after the conduct of the last medical examination," and the finding of the American Outpatient Clinic during his pre-employment medical examination that respondent was unfit for sea duty, which finding was concurred in by Dr. Hill of HAL, was merely "initial."<br><br>Petitioners go on to argue that the significance of the findings of the company-designated physician cannot just be disregarded by an all-encompassing statement motivated by the excessive compassion for seafarers, for the POEA Standard Contract clearly provides that it is solely the company-designated physician who shall determine the fitness or degree of disability or injury of a seafarer for purposes of employment;  and if respondent did not agree with the findings of the company-designated physician, he could have sought an opinion of a physician to rebut it.<br><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Section 20 B, paragraph 3 of the POEA Standard Employment Contract reads:<br><blockquote>3. Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">[30]</sup><span style="font-weight: bold;"> (Emphasis supplied)</span><br></blockquote>Contrary to petitioners' argument, the findings of the company-designated physician were not disregarded.  As gathered from the records of the case, two company-designated physicians, Dr. Abesamis of the American Outpatient Clinic and HAL's Dr. Hill, found respondent to be unfit for sea duty.  It was on the basis of such finding that respondent anchored his claim for disability benefits. There was no reason for respondent to seek the opinion of another physician because he was not contesting Doctors Abesamis and Hill's identical finding.<br><br>Petitioners' allegation that the diagnosis of respondent being "unfit" was merely "initial" fails.  In HAL's correspondence with ULP on March 16, 1999, it reiterated its declaration that respondent was "permanently unfit" and even asked ULP to determine the partial disability percentage, it positing that permanent unfitness is different from permanent disability.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Notatu dignum </span>is the correct observation of the appellate court in its above-quoted portion of its decision that it was only after respondent had filed a claim for permanent disability that Doctors Abaya and Hill declared him fit for sea duty.<br><br>But even in the absence of an official finding by the company-designated physicians that respondent is unfit for sea duty, respondent is deemed to have suffered permanent disability. Permanent disability is the inability of a worker to perform his job for more than 120 days, regardless of whether he loses the use of any part of his body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  It is undisputed that from the time respondent suffered a heart attack on December 5, 1997, he was unable to work for more than 120 days, his cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy having ended only on May 28, 1998.<br><br>That respondent was found to be "fit to return to work" by Clinica Manila (where he underwent regular cardiac rehabilitation program and physical therapy from January 15 to May 28, 1998 under UPL's account) on September 22, 1998 or a few months after his rehabilitation does not matter.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Crystal Shipping Inc., v. Natividad</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-style: italic;">[</span>32]</sup> teaches:<br><blockquote>Petitioners tried to contest the above findings by showing that respondent was able to work again as a chief mate in March 2001. Nonetheless, this information does not alter the fact that as a result of his illness, respondent was unable to work as a chief mate for almost three years.
