No. RTJ-99-1460 (<span style="font-style: italic;">Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr.</span>)</span><br><br>It was in 1995 that Atty. Florentino V. Floro, Jr. first applied for judgeship. A pre-requisite psychological evaluation on him then by the Supreme Court Clinic Services (SC Clinic) revealed "(e)vidence of ego disintegration' and "developing psychotic process." Judge Floro later voluntarily withdrew his application. In June 1998, when he applied anew, the required psychological evaluation exposed problems with self-esteem, mood swings, confusion, social/interpersonal deficits, paranoid ideations, suspiciousness, and perceptual distortions. Both 1995 and 1998 reports concluded that Atty. Floro was unfit to be a judge.<br><br>Because of his impressive academic background, however, the Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) allowed Atty. Floro to seek a second opinion from private practitioners. The second opinion appeared favorable thus paving the way to Atty. Floro's appointment as Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judge of Branch 73, Malabon City, on 4 November 1998.<br><br>Upon Judge Floro's personal request, an audit on his sala was conducted by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) from 2 to 3 March 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>After conducting the audit, the audit team, led by Atty. Mary Jane Dacarra-Buenaventura, reported its findings to erstwhile Court Administrator, Alfredo L. Benipayo, who submitted his own report/memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to then Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. dated 13 July 1999 recommending, among other things, that his report be considered as an administrative complaint against Judge Floro and that Judge Floro be subjected to an appropriate psychological or mental examination. Court Administrator Benipayo recommended as well that Judge Floro be placed under preventive suspension for the duration of the investigation against him.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 20 July 1999, the Court en banc adopted the recommendations of the OCA, docketing the complaint as A.M. No. RTJ-99-1460, in view of the commission of the following acts or omissions as reported by the audit team:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) The act of circulating calling cards containing self-laudatory statements regarding qualifications and for announcing in open court during court session his qualification in violation of Canon 2, Rule 2.02, Canons of Judicial Conduct;<br><br>(b) For allowing the use of his chambers as sleeping quarters;<br><br>(c) For rendering resolutions without written orders in violation of Rule 36, Section 1, 1997 Rules of Procedures;<br><br>(d) For his alleged partiality in criminal cases where he declares that he is pro-accused which is contrary to Canon 2, Rule 2.01, Canons of Judicial Conduct;<br><br>(e) For appearing and signing pleadings in Civil Case No. 46-M-98 pending before Regional Trial Court, Branch 83, Malolos, Bulacan in violation of Canon 5, Rule 5.07, Canons of Judicial Conduct which prohibits a judge from engaging in the private practice of law;<br><br>(f) For appearing in personal cases without prior authority from the Supreme Court and without filing the corresponding applications for leaves of absence on the scheduled dates of hearing;<br><br>(g) For proceeding with the hearing on the Motion for Release on Recognizance filed by the accused without the presence of the trial prosecutor and propounding questions in the form of examination of the custodian of the accused;<br><br>(h) For using/taking advantage of his moral ascendancy to settle and eventually dismiss Criminal Case No. 20385-MN (for frustrated homicide) in the guise of settling the civil aspect of the case, by persuading the private complainant and the accused to sign the settlement even without the presence of the trial prosecutor;<br><br>(i) For <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span> and over the strong objection of the trial prosecutor, ordering the mental and physical examination of the accused based on the ground that the accused is "mahina ang pick-up";<br><br>(j) For issuing an Order on 8 March 1999 which varies from that which he issued in open court in Criminal Case No. 20385-MN, for frustrated homicide;<br><br>(k) For violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 Code of Judicial Conduct when he openly criticized the Rules of Court and the Philippine justice system;<br><br>(l) For the use of highly improper and intemperate language during court proceedings;<br><br>(m) For violation of Circular No. 13[5] dated 1 July 1987.<br></div></blockquote>Per the same resolution of the Court, the matter was referred to Retired Court of Appeals Justice Pedro Ramirez (consultant, OCA) for investigation, report and recommendation within 60 days from receipt. Judge Floro was directed to comment within ten days from receipt of the resolution and to subject himself to an appropriate psychological or mental examination to be conducted "by the proper office of the Supreme Court or any duly authorized medical and/or mental institution." In the same breath, the Court resolved to place Judge Floro under preventive suspension "for the duration of the investigation of the administrative charges against him." He was barely eight months into his position.<br><br>On 20 August 1999, Judge Floro submitted a Verified Comment where he set forth both affirmative and negative defenses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> while he filed his "Answer/Compliance" on 26 August 1999.<br><br>On 3 March 2000, Judge Floro moved for the provisional/final dismissal of his case for failure to prosecute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> However, on 21 March 2000, he presented himself as his first witness in the hearing conducted by Justice Ramirez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Subsequently, on 7 July 2000, Judge Floro filed a "Petition for Inhibition/Disqualification" against Justice Ramirez as investigator<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9] </sup>which was dened by Justice Ramirez in an Order dated 11 July 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Judge Floro's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> suffered the same fate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On 27 July 2000, Judge Floro submitted the question of Justice Ramirez's inhibition/disqualification to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On 8 August 2000, the Court ruled against the inhibition of Justice Ramirez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On 11 September 2000, the OCA, after having been ordered by the Court to comment on Judge Floro's motion to dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15] </sup>recommended that the same should be denied.<br><br>Judge Floro presented his last witness on 6 March 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup>The day after, Justice Ramirez came out with a "Partial Report" recommending the dismissal of Judge Floro from office "by reason of insanity which renders him incapable and unfit to perform the duties and functions of Judge of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Malabon, Metro Manila, Branch 73."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, throughout the investigation of the 13 charges against him and even after Justice Ramirez came out with his report and recommendation on 7 March 2001, Judge Floro had been indiscriminately filing cases against those he perceived to have connived to boot him out of office.<br><br>A list of the cases Judge Floro filed in the wake of his 20 July 1999 preventive suspension follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li> OCA IPI No. 00-07-OCA — against Atty.

No. RTJ-06-1988 (<span style="font-style: italic;">Luz Arriego v. Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr.</span>)</span><br><br>This charge is likewise the subject matter of charge "h" in A.M. No. RTJ-99-1460: "(f)or using/taking advantage of his moral ascendancy to settle and eventually dismiss Criminal Case No. 20385-MN (for frustrated homicide) in the guise of settling the civil aspect of the case, by persuading the private complainant and the accused to sign the settlement even without the presence of the trial prosecutor." The complainant Luz Arriego is the mother of the private complainant in Criminal Case No. 20385-MN.<br><br>On 28 June 2001, Arriego testified, while court stenographer Jocelyn Japitenga testified on 16 July 2001. On 31 July 2001, Arriego filed her Formal Offer of Evidence which was opposed by Judge Floro on 21 August 2001. On 5 September 2001, Judge Floro testified on his behalf while Atty. Galang testified against him on 4 October 2001. On 16 October 2001, Judge Floro filed a Memorandum in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Third Case: A.M. No. 99-7-273-RTC (<span style="font-style: italic;">Re: Resolution Dated 11 May 1999 of Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr.</span>)</span><br><br>As can be gathered from the title, this case concerns a resolution issued by Judge Floro on 11 May 1999 in Special Proceeding Case No. 315-MN "In Re: Petition To Be Admitted A Citizen Of The Philippines, Mary Ng Nei, Petitioner." The resolution disposed of the motions for voluntary inhibition of Judge Floro and the reconsideration of the order denying the petition for naturalization filed by petitioner in that case, Mary Ng Nei.<br><br>This resolution found its way to the OCA through a letter written by Atty. David S. Narvasa, the petitioner's counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The OCA, through Court Administrator Benipayo, made the following evaluation:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">In the subject resolution, Judge Floro, Jr. denied the motion for inhibition and declared it as null and void. However, he ordered the raffling of the case anew (not re-raffle due to inhibition) so that the petitioner, Mary Ng Nei, will have a chance to have the case be assigned to other judges through an impartial raffle.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">When Judge Floro, Jr. denied the motion for inhibition, he should have continued hearing and taking cognizance of the case. It is improper for him to order the raffle of the case "anew" as this violates Administrative Circular No. 1 (Implementation of Sec. 12, Art. XVIII of the 1987 Constitution) dated January 28, 1988 which provides to wit:<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">"8. Raffle of Cases:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>8.3 Special raffles should not be permitted <span style="font-style: italic;">except on verified application of the interested party who seeks issuance of a provisional remedy and only upon a finding by the Executive Judge that unless the special raffle is conducted, irreparable damage shall be suffered by the applicant. </span>The special raffle shall be conducted by at least two judges in a multiple-sala station.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">x x x x"<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Based on the foregoing, a judge may not motu proprio order the special raffle of a case since such is only allowed upon a verified application of the interested party seeking a provisional remedy and only upon the Executive Judge's finding that if a special raffle is not conducted, the applicant will suffer irreparable damage. Therefore, Judge Floro, Jr.'s order is contrary to the above-mentioned Administrative Circular.<br><br>Moreover, it is highly inappropriate for Judge Floro, Jr. to even mention in his resolution that Justice Regino C. Hermosisima, Jr. is his benefactor in his nomination for judgeship. It is not unusual to hear a judge who speaks highly of a "padrino" (who helped him get his position). Such remark even if made as an expression of deep gratitude makes the judge guilty of creating a dubious impression about his integrity and independence. Such flaunting and expression of feelings must be suppressed by the judges concerned. A judge shall not allow family, social, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment (Canon 2, Rule 2.03, Code of Judicial Conduct).<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The merits of the denial of the motion for inhibition and the ruling on the motion for reconsideration are judicial matters which this Office has no authority to review. The remedy is judicial, not administrative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></div></blockquote>The OCA thus recommended that Judge Floro comment on (a) his act of ordering the raffle of the case in violation of Administrative Circular No. 1; and (b) his remark on page 5 of the subject resolution that "Justice Hermosisima, Jr. x x x helped undersigned so much, in the JBC, regarding his nomination x x x."<br><br>In a Resolution dated 17 August 1999, the Court en banc adopted the recommendations of the OCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Judge Floro, through his counsel, filed his Comment on 22 October 1999<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> which was noted by this Court on 7 December 1999. On 11 January 2000, Judge Floro filed a Formal Offer of Evidence which this Court, in a resolution dated 25 January 2000, referred to Justice Ramirez for inclusion in his report and recommendation.<br><br>For the record, the OCA is yet to come up with its report and recommendation in this case as well as in the second case (i.e., A.M. No. RTJ-06-1988). Thus, in a resolution dated 14 February 2006, the Court directed Judge Floro as well as the other parties in these two cases to inform the Court whether or not they are willing to submit A.M. RTJ-06-1988 and A.M. No. 99-7-273-RTC for decision on the basis of the pleadings filed and the evidence so far submitted by them or to have the decision in A.M. No. RTJ-99-1460 decided ahead of the two. On 20 February 2006, the OCA, thru Court Administrator Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr., manifested its willingness to submit A.M. No. 99-7-273-RTC for resolution based on the pleadings and the evidence submitted therein. Complainant Luz Arriego in A.M. No. RTJ-06-1988 likewise informed this Court, in a Letter dated 28 February 2006, her willingness to submit her case for decision based on the pleadings already submitted and on the evidence previously offered and marked. On the other hand, on 3 March 2006, Judge Floro manifested his preference to have A.M. No. RTJ-99-1460 decided ahead of A.M. RTJ-06-1988 and A.M. No. 99-7-273-RTC.<br><br>In the interest of orderly administration of justice, considering that these are consolidated cases, we resolve to render as well a consolidated decision.<br><br>But first, the ground rules: Much has been said across all fronts regarding Judge Floro's alleged mental illness and its effects on his duties as Judge of a Regional Trial Court. For our part, figuring out whether Judge Floro is indeed psychologically impaired and/or disabled as concluded by the investigator appointed by this Court is frankly beyond our sphere of competence, involving as it does a purely medical issue; hence, we will have to depend on the findings of the mental health professionals who interviewed/analyzed Judge Floro. Our job is simply to wade through the evidence, filter out the irrelevant and the irreverent in order to determine once and for all if Judge Floro is indeed guilty of the charges against him. If the evidence makes out a case against Judge Floro, the next issue is to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed.<br><br>Finally, we will have to determine whether Judge Floro acted with an evil mind or because of a psychological or mental incapacity. Upon the resolution of this question hinges the applicability of equity.<br><br>As an aside, it bears pointing out that some of the charges ("c" and "g", "h" and "j", "e" and "f") will be jointly discussed as they had likewise been jointly discussed by the OCA. These charges involve common facts and to treat them separately will be superfluous.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">DISCUSSION<br></div><br><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">As alleged and as proven, the 13 specified charges do not warrant the supreme penalty of dismissal against Judge Floro</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) Re: Charge of circulating calling cards containing self-laudatory statements regarding qualifications AND for announcing in open court during court session his qualifications in violation of Canon 2, Rule 2.02, Canons of Judicial Conduct<br></div><br>As narrated by the audit team, Judge Floro was circulating calling cards bearing his name as the Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 73, Malabon City, and indicating therein that he is a "bar exams topnotcher (87.55%)" and with "full second honors" from the Ateneo de Manila University, A.B. and LL.B.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The audit team likewise reported that: "(b)efore the start of court session, Judge Floro is introduced as a private law practitioner, a graduate of Ateneo de Manila University with second honors, and a bar topnotcher during the 1983 Bar Examinations with an average score of 87.55%. Afterwards, a reading of the Holy Bible, particularly the Book of Revelation according to Saint John, was made. The people in the courtroom were given the opportunity to ask Judge Floro questions on the matter read. No questions were asked; hence the session commenced."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Judge Floro argues that, per commentary of Justice Ruperto G. Martin,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> "the use of professional cards containing the name of the lawyer, his title, his office and residence is not improper" and that the word "title" should be broad enough to include a Judge's legal standing in the bar, his honors duly earned or even his Law School. Moreover, other lawyers do include in their calling cards their former/present titles/positions like President of the Jaycees, Rotary Club, etc., so where then does one draw the line? Finally, Judge Floro argues that his cards were not being circulated but were given merely as tokens to close friends or by reciprocity to other callers considering that common sense dictates that he is not allowed by law to seek other professional employment.<br><br>As to the charge that he had been announcing in open court his qualifications, Judge Floro counters that it was his branch clerk of court, Atty. Esmeralda Galang-Dizon, who suggested that during his initial court session, she would briefly announce his appointment with an introduction of his school, honors, bar rating and law practice. Naively, Judge Floro agreed as the introduction was done only during the first week of his assumption into office.<br><br>Canon 2, Rule 2.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct says in no uncertain terms that "a judge should not seek publicity for personal vainglory." A parallel proscription, this time for lawyers in general, is found in Rule 3.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility: "a lawyer shall not use or permit the use of any false, fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, undignified, self-laudatory or unfair statement or claim regarding his qualifications or legal services." This means that lawyers and judges alike, being limited by the exacting standards of their profession, cannot debase the same by acting as if ordinary merchants hawking their wares. As succinctly put by a leading authority in legal and judicial ethics, "(i)f lawyers are prohibited from x x x using or permitting the use of any undignified or self-laudatory statement regarding their qualifications or legal services (Rule 3.01, Code of Professional Responsibility), with more reasons should judges be prohibited from seeking publicity for vanity or self-glorification. Judges are not actors or actresses or politicians, who thrive by publicity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The question, therefore, is: By including self-laudatory details in his professional card, did Judge Floro violate Canon 2, Rule 2.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct?<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ulep v. Legal Clinic, Inc.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we explained that the use of an ordinary and simple professional card by lawyers is permitted and that the card "may contain only a statement of his name, the name of the law firm which he is connected with, address, telephone number and special branch of law practiced." In herein case, Judge Floro's calling cards cannot be considered as simple and ordinary. By including therein the honors he received from his law school with a claim of being a bar topnotcher, Judge Floro breached the norms of simplicity and modesty required of judges.<br><br>Judge Floro insists, however, that he never circulated his cards as these were just given by him as tokens and/or only to a few who requested the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The investigation by Justice Ramirez into the matter reveals otherwise. An eye-witness from the OCA categorically stated that Judge Floro circulated these cards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Worse, Judge Floro's very own witness, a researcher from an adjoining branch, testified that Judge Floro gave her one of these cards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>As this charge involves a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, it should be measured against Rule 140 of the Rules of Court as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC being more favorable to respondent Judge Floro. Rule 140, before its amendment, automatically classified violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct as serious charges. As amended, a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct may amount to gross misconduct, which is a serious charge, or it may amount to simple misconduct, which is a less serious charge or it may simply be a case of vulgar and/or unbecoming conduct which is a light charge.<br><br>"Misconduct" is defined as wrong or improper conduct while "gross" connotes something "out of all measure; beyond allowance; not to be excused; flagrant; shameful."<sup style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</span> </sup>For serious misconduct to exist, the judicial act complained of should be corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law or a persistent disregard of well-known legal rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>With the foregoing as yardstick, we find the act of Judge Floro in circulating calling cards containing self-laudatory statements constitutive of simple misconduct in violation of Canon 2, Rule 2.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct as it appears that Judge Floro was not motivated by any corrupt motive but, from what we can see from the evidence, a persistent and unquenchable thirst for recognition. Concededly, the need for recognition is an all too human flaw and judges do not cease to be human upon donning the judicial robe. Considering, however, the proscription against judges seeking publicity for personal vainglory, they are held to a higher standard as they must act within the confines of the code they swore to observe.<br><br>As to the charge that Judge Floro, through his branch clerk of court, had been announcing in open court his qualifications, we find that this is likewise violative of Canon 2, Rule 2.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct as it smacks of unnecessary publicity. Judges should not use the courtroom as platform for announcing their qualifications especially to an audience of lawyers and litigants who very well might interpret such publicity as a sign of insecurity. Verily, the public looks upon judges as the bastion of justice — confident, competent and true. And to discover that this is not so, as the judge appears so unsure of his capabilities that he has to court the litigants and their lawyers' approval, definitely erodes public confidence in the judiciary.<br><br>As it is not disputed, however, that these announcements went on for only a week, Judge Floro is guilty of simple misconduct only.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) Re: Charge of allowing the use of his chambers as sleeping quarters<br></div><br>The audit team observed that "inside Judge Floro's chamber[s], there is a folding bed with cushion located at the right corner of the room. A man, who was later identified as Judge Floro's driver, was sleeping. However, upon seeing the audit team, the driver immediately went out of the room."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Judge Floro contends that this charge is without legal or factual basis. The man the audit team saw "sleeping" on his folding bed, J. Torralba, was Judge Floro's aide or "<span style="font-style: italic;">alalay"</span> whom he allows to rest from time to time (in between periods and especially during court sessions) for humanitarian reasons. J. Torralba was not sleeping during that time that the audit team was in Branch 73 as he immediately left when he saw the members thereof.<br><br>This charge must fail as there is nothing inherently improper or deplorable in Judge Floro having allowed another person to use his folding bed for short periods of time during office hours and while there is no one else in the room. The situation would have been different if there had been any allegation of misuse or abuse of government funds and/or facilities such as in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Presado v.

It was reported by the staff of Branch 73 that regardless of the absence of the trial prosecutor, Judge Floro, Jr. still proceeded with the hearing of the following matters:<br><blockquote>(c-1) <span style="font-style: italic;">"Motion for Release on Recognizance</span>" filed by the accused, in Criminal Cases Nos. 20384, 20371, 20246 and 20442 entitled "<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Luisito Beltran</span>", "<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Emma Alvarez, et al.</span>", "<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Rowena Camino</span>", and "<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. John Richie Villaluz</span>", respectively. In the hearing of these motions, Judge Floro, Jr. propounded questions (in a form of direct examination) to the custodian of the accused without the accused being sworn by the administering officer. (Note: initially, Judge Floro, Jr. ordered the Branch Clerk of Court Dizon to place th accused under oath prior to the start of his questions. However, COC Dizon refused). The hearing on the aforesaid motions is an offshoot of a previous hearing wherein the accused had pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. After the reading of the sentence, Judge Floro, Jr. would automatically inform the accused that they are qualified to apply for probation. In fact, Judge Floro, Jr. would even instruct his staff to draft the application in behalf of the accused so that a motion for release on recognizance will immediately be heard and be consequently granted. As appearing in the minutes of the hearing (<span style="font-style: italic;">attached herewith as Annexes "3" to "6"</span>), the custodians of the accused are either a barangay kagawad, barangay tanod or a member of the lupong tagapamayapa. Likewise, no written order granting the motion for release on recognizance is being issued by Judge Floro, Jr. since according to him neither rules nor circular mandates the issuance of a written order. Instead, after granting the motion, Judge Floro, Jr. just requires the parties to sign the minutes of the session. Photocopies of the minutes dated March 4, 1999 in Criminal Cases Nos. 20384-MN; 20373-MN; and 20371-MN are hereto attached as <span style="font-style: italic;">Annexes "3" to "5"</span>.<br><br>On March 11, 1999, in Criminal Cases Nos. 20426-MN and 20442-MN, Judge Floro, Jr. granted a similar motion without issuing a written order. Copies of the minutes are hereto attached as annexes "6" to "7."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote> <blockquote>In his Verified Comment, Judge Floro argues that he never violated any rule of procedure with respect to the cases mentioned by the Audit Team, asserting that —<br><br>Contrary to the stance of the TEAM, Sec. 1 of Rule 36, Rules of Court refers only to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">final and not interlocutory orders</span>. Only final orders and judgments are promulgated, rendered and entered.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Applying the foregoing well-settled doctrines of law to the case at bar, herein respondent faithfully complied with the requirements of Sec. 7 of P.D. 968 as amended, regarding the applications for release on recognizance, thus:<br></blockquote></div><blockquote><ol style="margin-left: 40px;" type="a"><li> The application for release on recognizance, although captioned as MOTION FOR RELEASE ON RECOGNIZANCE, is primarily governed by Sec. 7 of P.D. 968, a Special Law on Probation.<br><br></li><li> Any Application for Release on Recognizance, is given due course/taken cognizance of by respondent, if on its face, the same bears the rubber stamp mark/receipt by the Office of the City/Public Prosecutor.<br><br></li><li> The consistent practice both in RTC, METRO MANILA (all courts), especially in RTC, MALABON, and in Malolos, Bulacan (where respondent practiced from 1985-1998 — almost 14 years), [and especially the practice of former Judge A. V. Cabigao, Br. 73, RTC, Malabon, Metro Manila], is to interview the custodian, in the chambers, regarding his being a responsible member of the community where the accused reside/resides; the questions propounded are in the form of direct and even cross examination questions.<br><br></li><li> The accused is not required to be placed on the witness stand, since there is no such requirement. All that is required, is to inform the accused regarding some matters of probation (optional) such as whether he was sentenced previously by a Court, whether or not he has had previous cases, etc.<br><br></li><li> Even if RTC Judges in Malabon do not conduct Court hearings on application for release on recognizance, respondent, for caution in most of the applications, included the interview/hearing on the applications for release on recognizance, during criminal trial dates, where a fiscal/trial prosecutor is available; at other times, the hearing is held in the chambers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The explanation given by Judge Floro betrays his liability for ignorance of the rules on probation under Presidential Decree No. 968 (Probation Law), as amended. Contrary to his remonstrations, the release of an accused on recognizance entails more than a cursory interview of the custodian and the applicant. Under the Probation Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and as we explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Poso v. Judge Mijares,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> it is incumbent upon the Judge hearing the application to ascertain first that the applicant is not a "disqualified offender" as "(p)utting the discharge of the accused on hold would have allowed [the judge] more time to pass upon the request for provisional liberty."<br><br>Moreover, from Judge Floro's explanations, it would seem that he completely did away with the requirement for an investigation report by the probation officer. Under the Probation Law, the accused's temporary liberty is warranted only during the period for awaiting the submission of the investigation report on the application for probation and the resolution thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As we explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Poso v. Judge Mijares</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="font-style: italic;">[</span>49]</sup>:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><blockquote> It must be stressed that the statutory sequence of actions, i.e., order to conduct case study prior to action on application for release on recognizance, was prescribed precisely to underscore the interim character of the provisional liberty envisioned under the Probation Law. Stated differently, the temporary liberty of an applicant for probation is effective no longer than the period for awaiting the submission of the investigation report and the resolution of the petition, which the law mandates as no more than sixty (60) days to finish the case study and report and a maximum of fifteen (15) days from receipt of the report for the trial judge to resolve the application for probation. By allowing the temporary liberty of the accused even before the order to submit the case study and report, respondent Judge unceremoniously extended the pro tem discharge of the accused to the detriment of the prosecution and the private complainants. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></div>As to the argument of Judge Floro that his Orders for the release of an accused on recognizance need not be in writing as these are duly reflected in the transcript of stenographic notes, we refer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Echaus v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> wherein we held that "no judgment, or order whether final or interlocutory, has juridical existence until and unless it is set down in writing, signed and promulgated, i.e., delivered by the Judge to the Clerk of Court for filing, release to the parties and implementation." Obviously, then, Judge Floro was remiss in his duties as judge when he did not reduce into writing his orders for the release on recognizance of the accused in Criminal Cases No. 20384, 20371, 202426 and 20442 entitled, "<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Luisito Beltran,</span>" "<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Emma Alvarez, et al.,</span>" "<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Rowena Camino,</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. John Richie Villaluz</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> From his explanation that such written orders are not necessary, we can surmise that Judge Floro's failure was not due to inadvertence or negligence on his part but to ignorance of a procedural rule.<br><br>In fine, we perceive three fundamental errors in Judge Floro's handling of probation cases. First, he ordered the release on recognizance of the accused without the presence of the prosecutor thus depriving the latter of any opportunity to oppose said release. Second, Judge Floro ordered the release without first requiring the probation officer to render a case study and investigation report on the accused. Finally, the order granting the release of the accused on recognizance was not reduced into writing.<br><br>It would seem from the foregoing that the release of the accused on recognizance, as well as his eventual probation, was already a done deal even before the hearing on his application as Judge Floro took up the cudgels for the accused by instructing his staff to draft the application for probation. This, Judge Floro did not deny. Thus, we agree in the observation of the audit team that Judge Floro, as a matter of policy, had been approving applications for release on recognizance hastily and without observing the requirements of the law for said purpose. Verily, we having nothing against courts leaning backward in favor of the accused; in fact, this is a salutary endeavor, <span style="font-style: italic;">but only when the situation so warrants</span>. In herein case, however, we cannot countenance what Judge Floro did as "the unsolicited fervor to release the accused significantly deprived the prosecution and the private complainants of their right to due process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Judge Floro's insistence that orders made in open court need not be reduced in writing constitutes gross ignorance of the law.

He claims that what he did impart upon Atty. Buenaventura was the need for the OCA to remedy his predicament of having 40 detention prisoners and other bonded accused whose cases could not be tried due to the lack of a permanent prosecutor assigned to his sala. He narrated as well to Atty. Buenaventura the sufferings of detention prisoners languishing in the Malabon/Navotas jail whose cases had not been tried during the vacancy of his sala from February 1997 to 5 November 1998. At any rate, Judge Floro submits that there is no single evidence or proof submitted by any litigant or private complainant that he sided with the accused.<br><br>Atty. Dizon, Judge Floro's Clerk of Court, on the other hand, categorically stated under oath that Judge Floro, during a staff meeting, admitted to her and the staff of Branch 73 and in the presence of his Public Attorney's Office (PAO) lawyer that he is pro-accused for the reason that he commiserated with them especially those under detention as he, himself, had been accused by his brother and sister-in-law of so many unfounded offenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Between the two versions, the testimony of Atty.

Prudence and judicial restraint dictate that a judge should reserve personal views and predilections to himself so as not to stir up suspicions of bias and unfairness. Irresponsible speech or improper conduct of a judge erodes public confidence in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> "His language, both written and spoken, must be guarded and measured, lest the best of intentions be misconstrued."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On a more fundamental level, what is required of judges is objectivity if an independent judiciary is to be realized.

In the same order, Judge Floro, Jr. reserved his ruling on the said settlement until after the public prosecutor has given his comment. However, per report of the court employees in Branch 73, the aforesaid order was actually a revised one or a deviation from the original order given in open court. Actually, the said criminal case was already settled even without the presence of the public prosecutor. The settlement was in the nature of absolving not only the civil liability of the accused but the criminal liability as well. It was further reported that the private complainants signed the compromise agreement due to the insistence or persuasion of Judge Floro, Jr. The audit team was furnished a copy of the stenographic notes (unsigned draft order) and the revised order (signed).

OCA-I.P.I. No. 99-812-RTJ. In her Affidavit Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> dated 9 August 1999, she alleged that on 8 March 1999, Judge Floro forced them to settle her daughter's case against the accused therein despite the absence of the trial prosecutor. When the parties could not agree on the amount to be paid by the accused for the medical expenses incurred by complaining witness, they requested respondent that they be given time to study the matter and consult a lawyer to which Judge Floro replied that the case be settled immediately, uttering, "<span style="font-style: italic;">ngayon na! ngayon na!</span>" Moreover, Judge Floro allegedly made them believe that the counter-charges filed by the accused against the complaining witness would likewise be dismissed, so they agreed to settle the case. However, the written Order issued by respondent Judge did not reflect the agreement entered into by the parties in open court.<br><br>Judge Floro takes exception to the foregoing OCA report and the complaint filed by Mrs. Arriego, maintaining that the hearing on said case was not only in accordance with the Rules of Court but was also beneficial to the litigants concerned as they openly manifested their willingness to patch up their differences in the spirit of reconciliation. Then, considering that the parties suggested that they would file the necessary pleadings in due course, Judge Floro waited for such pleadings before the TSN-dictated Order could be reduced to writing. Meanwhile, in the course of a conversation between Judge Floro and Court Administrator Benipayo, the latter opined that under Section 27 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, an offer of compromise in criminal cases is tantamount to an admission of guilt except in some cases. With this in mind, the 8 March 1999 Order of the hearing on even date was superseded by the revised written Order likewise dated 8 March 1999.<br><br>Judge Floro asserts that contrary to Atty. Buenaventura's stance that he has no power to revise an Order, courts have plenary power to recall and amend or revise any orally dictated order in substance and in form even <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span>.<br><br>The rule on the matter finds expression in <span style="font-style: italic;">Echaus v.

This is so even if the order or judgment has in fact been orally pronounced in the presence of the parties, or a draft thereof drawn up and signed and/or copy thereof somehow read or acquired by any party.

The controversial settlement never came to pass. It was not judicially approved as reflected in the revised Order of 8 March 1999, thus, Mrs. Arriego actually had no cause for complaint.

It must be remembered that the scheduled arraignment took place in February 1999 when the applicable rule was still Section 12(a) of Rule 116 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure, which reads:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><blockquote>SEC. 12. <span style="font-style: italic;">Suspension of arraignment.</span> — The arraignment shall be suspended, if at the time thereof:<br><br>(a) The accused appears to be suffering from an unsound mental condition which effectively renders him unable to fully understand the charge against him and to plead intelligently thereto.

In this case Judge Floro, Jr. filed an "Ex-Parte Motion for Issuance of Entry of Judgment with Manifestation and/or Judicial Admission" wherein he signed as the petitioner and at the same time indicated that he is the presiding judge of RTC, Branch 73, Malabon, Metro Manila. Court stenographer Marissa Garcia, RTC, Branch 83, Malolos, Bulacan confirmed this information. Judge Floro, Jr. even attached a copy of his oath taking and his picture together with President Joseph Estrada to the aforesaid pleading.

Canon 5, Rule 5.07 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, on the other hand, provides that: "A judge shall not engage in the private practice of law."<br><br>Judge Floro vehemently denies the foregoing charge claiming that he hired lawyers to attend to his personal cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>A scrutiny of the voluminous records in this case does not reveal any concrete proof of Judge Floro having appeared as counsel in his personal cases after he had already been appointed Judge except that he prepared a pleading ("<span style="font-style: italic;">Ex Parte</span> Motion For Issuance of Entry of Judgment With Manifestation and/or Judicial Admission") jointly with his counsel of record in connection with a <span style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</span> case he filed against his brothers for the custody of their "mild, mentally-retarded" brother. He explained, however, that he prepared the said pleading in the heat of anger as he could not accept the judgment of dismissal in that case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> He likewise explained that the pleading was signed by him alone due to inadvertence and that he had rectified the same by filing an Amended Manifestation with Affidavit of Merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79] </sup>Finally, during the hearing of this case, Judge Floro argued that he filed the subject pleading as petitioner and not as counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The proscription against the private practice of law by judges is based on sound public policy, thus:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><blockquote> [T]he rights, duties, privileges and functions of the office of an attorney-at-law are inherently incompatible with the high official functions, duties, powers, discretion and privileges of a judge. It also aims to ensure that judges give their full time and attention to their judicial duties, prevent them from extending special favors to their own private interests and assure the public of their impartiality in the performance of their functions. These objectives are dictated by a sense of moral decency and desire to promote the public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></blockquote></div>Based on the above rationale, it becomes quite evident that what is envisioned by "private practice" is more than an isolated court appearance, for it consists in frequent or customary action, a succession of acts of the same nature habitually or customarily holding one's self to the public as a lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> In herein case, save for the "Motion for Entry of Judgment," it does not appear from the records that Judge Floro filed other pleadings or appeared in any other court proceedings in connection with his personal cases. It is safe to conclude, therefore, that Judge Floro's act of filing the motion for entry of judgment is but an isolated case and does not in any wise constitute private practice of law. Moreover, we cannot ignore the fact that Judge Floro is obviously not lawyering for any person in this case as he himself is the petitioner.<br><br>Be that as it may, though Judge Floro might not be guilty of unauthorized practice of law as defined, he is guilty of unbecoming conduct for signing a pleading wherein he indicated that he is the presiding judge of RTC, Branch 73, Malabon City and for appending to the pleading a copy of his oath with a picture of his oath-taking. The only logical explanation we can reach for such acts is that Judge Floro was obviously trying to influence or put pressure on a fellow judge by emphasizing that he himself is a judge and is thus in the right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Verily, Canon 2, Rule 2.04 of the Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that a "judge shall refrain from influencing in any manner the outcome of litigation or dispute pending before another court or administrative agency." By doing what he did, Judge Floro, to say the least, put a fellow judge in a very awkward position.<br><br>As to charge (f), the OCA has failed to substantiate its claim that Judge Floro has been attending the hearing of his personal cases without filing for leave of absence. As Judge Floro vehemently protests the charge as untrue, it was incumbent upon the OCA to prove its case. Time and again we have held that although administrative proceedings are not strictly bound by formal rules on evidence, the liberality of procedure in administrative actions is still subject to limitations imposed by the fundamental requirement of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(k) Re: Charge of openly criticizing the Rules of Court and the Philippine justice system<br><br>(l) Re: Charge of use of highly improper and intemperate language during court proceedings<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The memorandum report reads:<br><blockquote> In the course of the judicial audit, the audit team was able to observe the way Judge Floro, Jr. conducts court proceedings.

He even condemned the Philippine justice system and manifested his disgust on the unfairness of the system. Thus, he said:<br></div><div style="margin-left: 80px;"><blockquote>"Sabi ko paano ko matatagpuan ang katarungan dito sa korteng eto bulok ang hustisya.

They also made it appear that the conversation took place in a court proceeding when, in fact, this was inside his chambers.<br><br>During the investigation, it was established that the two tapes in question were submitted to the OCA sans the "yellow notes" and the official transcribed copy thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> This means that the transcribed copy that was submitted by the audit team as Annex "15" is but an unofficial copy and does not, by itself, prove that what was being recorded was a court proceeding. This being the case, the two tapes, without concrete proof that they were taken officially during a court proceeding, cannot be used against Judge Floro as the unauthorized recording of a private conversation is inadmissible under Rep.

Judge Floro has mentioned to each and everyone of us in branch 73 the alleged "kabulukan ng hustisya". Time and again he said the Rules of Court is of no use.

Not only the justice system did he criticize but likewise Judges and Justices. He told us . . . and I quote<span style="font-style: italic;"> "D" yan sa Malolos sangkatutak ang corrupt na Judges . . .

There is one time one Atty.

So, it did not surprise us one time when during a pre-trial conference in a Civil Case, for Civil Case No. 25-86-MN "Lopez v. Reyes and Mercado", he uttered offensive language against his fellow judge. Take the transcription of this court proceeding is already adapted by the Court Administrator. It was the content of the tape he sent the Court Administrator. Actually, for consultation and advise after hearing what Judge Floro discussed in open Court, before all of us, the court staff present in the hearing and before the lawyer and the defendants in the case, we were in quandary whether or not to attach in the record the stenographic notes or even the actual transcription of the proceedings because it contained offensive languages against the justice system, against a certain judge, against a certain Clerk of Court named Jude Assanda, against people he is disgusted with. In fact, instead of discussing the merit of the case or the possibility of the amicable settlement between the parties, he integrated this kind of discussion. So, as a Clerk of Court, I may not use my discretion whether or not to advise the stenographer to indeed present the same or attach the same in the record because it contained offensive languages highly improper and intemperate languages like for example, "putang ina", words like "ako ang anghel ng kamatayan, etcetera, etcetera".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The denials of Judge Floro are insufficient to discredit the straightforward and candid declarations of Atty. Dizon especially in the light of confirming proofs from Judge Floro himself.<br><br>The Court finds the version of Atty. Dizon more credible because subject utterances are consistent with Judge Floro's claims of intellectual superiority for having graduated with several honors from the Ateneo School of Law and having placed 13th in the bar examinations. Moreover, his utterances against the judicial system on account of his perception of injustice in the disposition of his brother's case are not far removed from his reactions to what he perceived were injustices committed against him by the OCA and by the persons who were either in charge of the cases against him or had some sort of participation therein. Consequently, although there is no direct proof that Judge Floro said what he is claimed to have said, nonetheless, evidence that he sees himself as intellectually superior as well as evidence of his habit of crying foul when things do not go his way, show that it is more likely that he actually criticized the Rules of Court and the judicial system and is thus guilty of unbecoming conduct. Verily, in administrative cases, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89] </sup>In this case, there is ample and competent proof of violation on Judge Floro's part.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(m) Re: Charge of violating Circular No. 13-87 dated 1 July 1987<br><br>The memorandum report stated that Judge Floro —<br><br>[D]eviat[ed] from the regular course of trial when he discusses matters involving his personal life and beliefs. Canon 3, Rule 3.03 provides that "[a] judge shall maintain order and proper decorum in the court." A disorderly judge generates disorderly work. An indecorous judge invites indecorous reactions. Hence, the need to maintain order and proper decorum in court. When the judge respects himself, others will respect him too. When he is orderly, others will follow suit. Proceedings in court must be conducted formally and solemnly. The atmosphere must be characterized with honor and dignity befitting the seriousness and importance of a judicial trial called to ascertain the truth. Anything which tends to detract from this atmosphere must be avoided. And the judge is supposed to be in control and is therefore responsible for any detraction therefrom.<br><br>Circular No. 13 (Guidelines in the Administration of Justice) dated July 1, 1987 provides that trial of cases should be conducted efficiently and expeditiously. Judges should plan the course and direction of trials so that waste of time is avoided.<br><br>Moreover, a judge should avoid being queer in his behavior, appearance and movements. He must always keep in mind that he is the visible representative of the law. Judge Floro, Jr.'s claims that he is endowed with psychic powers, that he can inflict pain and sickness to people, that he is the angel of death and that he has unseen "little friends" are manifestations of his psychological instability and therefore casts doubt on his capacity to carry out the functions and responsibilities of a judge. Hence, it is best to subject Judge Floro, Jr. once again to psychiatric or mental examination to ascertain his fitness to remain in the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></div><br>Circular No. 13-87, by itself, does not define nor punish an offense but, as its title would suggest, it merely sets the guidelines in the administration of justice following the ratification of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>The arguments forwarded by the OCA, however, best exemplify the fact that the 13 charges are inextricably linked to the charge of mental/psychological illness which allegedly renders Judge Floro unfit to continue discharging the functions of his office. This being the case, we will consider the allegation that Judge Floro proclaims himself to be endowed with psychic powers, that he can inflict pain and sickness to people, that he is the angel of death and that he has unseen "little friends" in determining the transcendental issue of his mental/psychological fitness to remain in office.<br><br>But before we even go into that, we must determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed for the seven of the 13 charges discussed above. To recapitulate, we have found Judge Floro guilty, in one way or another, of seven of the 13 charges against him. Thus:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) Charge "a" — simple misconduct<br><br>2) Charges "c" and "g" — gross ignorance of the law<br><br>3) Charge "d" — unbecoming conduct<br><br>4) Charge "e" — unbecoming conduct<br><br>5) Charges "k" and "l" — unbecoming conduct<br></div><br>Gross ignorance of the law or procedure is a serious charge. Under Rule 140 as amended, a judge guilty of a serious charge may be dismissed from the service, suspended from office without salary and other benefits for more than three but not exceeding six months or fined in the amount of P 20,000.00 but not exceeding P 40,000.00 depending on the circumstances of the case. In herein case, considering that Judge Floro had barely warmed his seat when he was slammed with these charges, his relative inexperience is to be taken in his favor. And, considering further that there is no allegation or proof that he acted in bad faith or with corrupt motives, we hold that a fine is the appropriate penalty. The fine is to be imposed in the maximum, i.e. P 40,000.00, as we will treat the findings of simple misconduct and unbecoming conduct as aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Judge Floro must be relieved of his position as Judge of RTC Malabon Branch due to a medically disabling condition of the mind that renders him unfit to discharge the functions of his office</span><br><br>As we have explained, the common thread which binds the 13 seemingly unrelated accusations in A.M. No. RTJ-99-1460 is the charge of mental illness against Judge Floro embodied in the requirement for him to undergo an appropriate mental or psychological examination and which necessitated his suspension pending investigation. This charge of mental illness, if true, renders him unfit to perform the functions of his office notwithstanding the fact that, in disposing of the 13 charges, there had been no finding of dismissal from the service against Judge Floro.<br><br>The Supreme Court Clinic first had occasion to interview Judge Floro when the latter applied for judgeship (which application he later voluntarily withdrew) way back in September 1995.

He emphasized his obsessive and compulsive method of studying, at least 15 hours per day regardless of whether it was school days or vacation time. Vying for honors all the time and graduated Law as second honor, he calls this self-discipline and self-organization. He expressed dissatisfaction of his achievements, tend to be a perfectionist and cannot accept failures. To emphasize his ultra bright mind and analytical system, he related that, for the past 3 to 5 years, he has been experiencing "Psychic vision" every morning and that the biggest secret of the universe are the "unseen things." He can predict future events because of "power in psychic phenomenon" as when his bar results was to be released, he saw lights in the sky "no. 13-1," and he got the 13th place.

Dr. Vista observed:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><blockquote>Atty. Floro has an impressive academic achievements (sic), and he takes pride in this. During the interview, he was quite reluctant to reveal information about his family background and would rather talk about his work and academic achievements. However, he failed to integrate his knowledge into a cohesive unit which he can utilize to cope with the various tasks that he undertakes. This renders him confused and ambivalent with a tendency to vacillate with decision-making. He also has a low self-esteem and prone to mood swings with the slightest provocation.<br><br>From the interview, there seems to have been no drastic change in his personality and level of functioning as a lawyer in private practice. However, he showed a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits. He has poor social skills and showed discomfort with close social contacts. Paranoid ideations, suspiciousness of others' motives as well as perceptual distortions were evident during the interview.<br><br>Atty. Floro's current intelligence function is along the mild mental retardation (68) which is below the expected cognitive efficiency of a judge. Despite his impressive academic background and achievements, he has lapses in judgment and may have problems with decision-making. His character traits such as suspiciousness and seclusiveness and preoccupation with paranormal and psychic phenomena though not detrimental to his role as a lawyer, may cloud his judgment, and hamper his primary role as a judge in dispensing justice. Furthermore, he is at present not intellectually and emotionally equipped to hurdle the responsibilities of a judge and he may decompensate when exposed to anxiety-provoking and stress-laden situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br></blockquote></div>It would seem that the JBC disregarded the above-quoted report as it allowed Judge Floro to seek a second opinion from private practitioners.

He is able to handle both concrete and abstract requirements of tasks. Alert to details, he has a logical approach in evaluating the relationship between things and ideas.<br><br>2. He thrives in predictable and structured situations, where he can consider solid facts to arrived (sic)at concrete, tangible outcomes. Task-oriented, he can organize procedures and details so as to get things done correctly and on schedule. He uses conventional standards to determine personal progress. Set in his views, he may not readily accept others' ideas and contributions especially if these oppose his own.<br><br>3. A serious and thorough approach to his commitments is expected of FFJ. Generally, he prefers to control his emotions and does not let this get in the way of his judgment and decisions.<br><br>II. EMOTIONAL/INTERPERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS<br><br>FFJ is motivated by the need to be recognized and respected for his undertakings. Achievement-oriented, he sets high personal standards and tends to judge himself and others according to these standards. When things do not develop along desired lines, he may become restless and impatient. Nevertheless, he is careful of his social stature and can be expected to comply with conventional social demands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br></blockquote></div>Testifying as one of Judge Floro's witnesses, Rowena A.

Eduardo T. Maaba, Ma. Nieves Celeste and Eduardo L. Jurilla, respondent Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr. is unfit because of insanity to remain in office as Judge of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Malabon, Metro Manila, Branch 73.<br><br>It is weird for respondent Judge to state in one of his pleadings in this case that President Estrada would not finish his term as President.

So is it strange of him to make use of his alleged psychic powers in writing decisions in the cases assigned to his court. It is improper and grandiose of him to express superiority over other judges in the course of hearings he is conducting and for him to say that he is very successful over many other applicants for the position he has been appointed. It is abnormal for a Judge to distribute self-serving propaganda. One who distributes such self-serving propaganda is odd, queer, amusing, irresponsible and abnormal. A judge suffering from delusion or hallucination is unfit to be one. So is he who gets into a trance while presiding at the hearing of a case in court. One need not be a doctor of medicine, a psychiatrist and a psychologist to determine and conclude that a person in such circumstances is mentally unfit or insane and should not be allowed to continue discharging the duties and functions of a judge. The life, liberty and property of the litigants in the court presided by such judge are in his hands. Hence, it is imperative that he is free from doubt as to his mental capacity and condition to continue discharging the functions of his office.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">RECOMMENDATION<br></div><br>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully recommended that by reason of insanity which renders him incapable and unfit to perform the duties and functions of Judge of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Malabon, Metro Manila, Branch 73, respondent Florentino V.

And, in fact, in our disposition of the 13 charges against him, we have not found him guilty of gross misconduct or acts or corruption. <span style="font-style: italic;">However, the findings of psychosis by the mental health professionals assigned to his case indicate gross deficiency in competence and independence.</span><br><br>Moreover, Judge Floro himself admitted that he believes in "psychic visions," of foreseeing the future because of his power in "psychic phenomenon." He believes in "duwendes" and of a covenant with his "dwarf friends Luis, Armand and Angel." He believes that he can write while on trance and that he had been seen by several people to have been in two places at the same time. He has likened himself to the "angel of death" who can inflict pains on people, especially upon those he perceived as corrupt officials of the RTCs of Malabon. He took to wearing blue robes during court sessions, switching only to black on Fridays. His own witness testified that Judge Floro explained that he wore black from head to foot on Fridays to recharge his psychic powers. Finally, Judge Floro conducted healing sessions in his chambers during his break time. All these things validate the findings of the Supreme Court Clinic about Judge Floro's uncommon beliefs and that such beliefs have spilled over to action.<br><br>Lest we be misconstrued, we do not denigrate such belief system. <span style="font-style: italic;">However, such beliefs, especially since Judge Floro acted on them, are so at odds with the critical and impartial thinking required of a judge under our judicial system.</span><br><br>Psychic phenomena, even assuming such exist, have no place in a judiciary duty bound to apply only positive law and, in its absence, equitable rules and principles in resolving controversies. Thus, Judge Floro's reference to psychic phenomena in the decision he rendered in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Francisco, Jr.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124] </sup>sticks out like a sore thumb. In said decision, Judge Floro discredited the testimony of the prosecution's principal witness by concluding that the testimony was a "fairytale" or a "fantastic story."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> He then went to state that "psychic phenomena" was destined to cooperate with the stenographer who transcribed the testimony of the witness. The pertinent portion of Judge Floro's decision is quoted hereunder:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><blockquote>3. The testimony of the prosecution's PRINCIPAL witness (sole eyewitness of the incident) NORMANDY is INCREDIBLE, is full of inconsistencies (major and not regarding minor points), ergo, the court concludes that due to several indicia of fraud/perjury (flagrant/palpable deception of the Court), his testimony is not worthy of belief, assuming <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ex-gratia argumenti,</span> that the same may be admissible, and his Court narrative is hereby declared a FAIRY TALE or a FANTASTIC STORY of a crime scene that is acceptable only for SCREEN/cinematic viewing.

Muro</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> we held that —<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">What is required on the part of judges is objectivity. An independent judiciary does not mean that judges can resolve specific disputes entirely as they please. There are both implicit and explicit limits on the way judges perform their role. Implicit limits include accepted legal values and the explicit limits are substantive and procedural rules of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinate to the "primordial necessity of order in the social life."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br></div><br>Judge Floro does not meet such requirement of objectivity and his competence for judicial tasks leaves much to be desired. As reported by the Supreme Court Clinic:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Despite his impressive academic background and achievements, he has lapses in judgment and may have problems with decision-making. His character traits such as suspiciousness and seclusiveness and preoccupation with paranormal and psychic phenomena though not detrimental to his role as a lawyer, may cloud his judgment, and hamper his primary role as a judge in dispensing justice. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br></div><br>Judge Floro's belief system, as well as his actuations in the eight months that he served as RTC judge, indubitably shows his inability to function with the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.<br><br>Verily, Judge Floro holds an exalted position in our system of government. Thus:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Long before a man dons the judicial robes, he has accepted and identified himself with large components of the judge's role. Especially if he has aspired to a judge's status, he is likely to have conducted himself, more or less unconsciously, in the fashion of one who is said to have "the judicial temperament." He is likely to have displayed the kinds of behavior that the judge's role demands. A large proportion of his experiences on the bench develop and reinforce such conformity, moreover. The ritualistic elements of investiture and of court procedure, the honorific forms of address, and even the imposing appearance of some court buildings serve to emphasize the demands upon his behavior. Even the most unscrupulous former ambulance chaser who owes his position to a thoroughly corrupt political organization must conform at least in part to the behaviors expected of him as a judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br></div><br>The expectations concerning judicial behavior are more than those expected of other public officials. Judges are seen as guardians of the law and they must thus identify themselves with the law to an even greater degree than legislators or executives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>As it has been said, "[j]udges administer justice judicially, i.e., not according to some abstract ideas of right and justice, but according to the rules laid down by society in its Code of Laws to which it gives its sanctions.

He cannot thus be allowed to continue as judge for to do so might result in a serious challenge to the existence of a critical and impartial judiciary.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Equitable considerations entitle Judge Floro backwages and other economic benefits for a period of three (3) years.</span><br><br>In retrospect, we are forced to say that Judge Floro should not have joined the judiciary as RTC judge. However, we have assiduously reviewed the history of this case and we cannot hold anyone legally responsible for such major and unfortunate faux pas.<br><br>Judge Floro did not breach any rule of procedure relative to his application for judgeship. He went through the entire gamut of tests and interviews and he was nominated by the JBC on the strength of his scholastic achievements. As to having failed the psychological examinations given by the SC Clinic, it must be pointed out that this was disregarded by the JBC upon Judge Floro's submission of psychiatric evaluations conducted by mental health professionals from the private sector and which were favorable to him. Nowhere is it alleged that Judge Floro acted less than honorably in procuring these evaluations.<br><br>The JBC in 1999 had all the discretion to refer Judge Floro to a private clinic for a second opinion of his mental and psychological fitness. In performing its functions, the JBC had been guided primarily by the Constitution which prescribes that members of the Judiciary must be, in addition to other requirements, persons of proven competence, integrity, probity and independence.[135] It was only on 18 October 2000 when it promulgated JBC-009, the "Rules of the Judicial and Bar Council," that the JBC put down in writing guidelines or criteria it had previously used in ascertaining "if one seeking such office meets the minimum constitutional qualifications and possesses qualities of mind and heart expected of the Judiciary."[136] Rule 6 thereof states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Good health.</span> — Good physical health and sound mental/psychological and emotional condition of the applicant play a critical role in his capacity and capability to perform the delicate task of administering justice. x x x<br><br>SEC. 2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Psychological/psychiatric tests.</span> — The applicant shall submit to psychological/psychiatric tests to be conducted by the Supreme Court Medical Clinic or by a psychologist and/or psychiatrist duly accredited by the Council.</blockquote>It would seem that as things stood then, the JBC could very well rely on the evaluation of a private psychologist or psychiatrist not accredited by the JBC. Thus, the JBC cannot be faulted for accepting the psychological evaluations of mental health professionals not affiliated with the Supreme Court Clinic.<br><br>It goes without saying that Judge Floro's appointment as RTC judge is <span style="font-style: italic;">fait accompli</span>. What awaits us now is the seemingly overwhelming task of finding the PROPER, JUST AND EQUITABLE solution to Judge Floro's almost seven years of suspension <span style="font-style: italic;">in the light of the fact that the penalty imposed herein does not merit a suspension of seven years.</span><br><br>Verily, the Supreme Court is vested with the power to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure in all courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137] </sup>The Constitution limits this power through the admonition that such rules "shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases, shall be uniform for all courts of the same grade, and shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>Rule 140 of the Rules of Court outlines the procedure to be followed in administrative cases against judges. Glaringly, Rule 140 does not detail the steps to be taken in cases when the judge is preventively suspended pending investigation. This is the state of things even after its amendment by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC which took effect on 1 October 2001.<br><br>The Supreme Court's power to suspend a judge, however, is inherent in its power of administrative supervision over all courts and the personnel thereof.[139] This power — consistent with the power to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure in all courts — is hemmed in only by the Constitution which prescribes that an adjective law cannot, among other things, diminish, increase or modify substantive rights.<br><br>The resolution of 20 July 1999 which put Judge Floro under preventive suspension resolved to:<br><blockquote>(1) DIRECT Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr. to answer the foregoing charges against him within ten (10) days from notice; (2) REFER this case to Retired Justice Pedro Ramirez, Consultant, Office of the Court Administrator for investigation, report and recommendation, within sixty (60) days from receipt of the records thereof; (3) SUBJECT Judge Florentino V. Floro, Jr. for appropriate psychological or mental examination to be conducted by the proper office of the Supreme Court or any duly authorized medical and/or mental institution.<br></blockquote><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Moreover, the Court RESOLVED to place Judge Florentino Floro, effective immediately under PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION for the duration of the investigation of the administrative charges against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br></div><br>As can be gleaned from the above-quoted resolution, Judge Floro's suspension, albeit indefinite, was for the duration of the investigation of the 13 charges against him which the Court pegged at 60 days from the time of receipt by the investigator of the records of the case. Rule 140, as amended, now states that "(t)he investigating Justice or Judge shall terminate the investigation within ninety (90) days from the date of its commencement or within such extension as the Supreme Court may grant"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> and, "(w)ithin thirty (30) days from the termination of the investigation, the investigating Justice or Judge shall submit to the Supreme Court a report containing findings of fact and recommendation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, the rule now is that a Judge can be preventively suspended not only for the entire period of his investigation which would be 90 days (unless extended by the Supreme Court) but also for the 30 days that it would take the investigating judge or justice to come up with his report. Moreover, the Court may preventively suspend a judge until such time that a final decision is reached in the administrative case against him or her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143] </sup>This is because —<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">[U]nlike ordinary civil service officials and employees, judges who are charged with a serious offense warranting preventive suspension are not automatically reinstated upon expiration of the ninety (90)-day period, as mandated above. The Court may preventively suspend a judge until a final decision is reached in the administrative case especially where there is a strong likelihood of his guilt or complicity in the offense charged. Indeed, the measure is intended to shield the public from any further damage or wrongdoing that may be caused by the continued assumption of office by the erring judge. It is also intended to protect the courts' image as temples of justice where litigants are heard, rights and conflicts settled and justice solemnly dispensed.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is a necessary consequence that a judge must bear for the privilege of occupying an exalted position. Among civil servants, a judge is indeed in a class all its own. After all, in the vast government bureaucracy, judges are beacon lights looked upon as the embodiment of all what is right, just and proper, the ultimate weapons against justice and oppression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br></div><br>In the case of Judge Floro, he is under preventive suspension up to the present because of the serious charge of mental unfitness aggravated by the fact that the actual investigation into his cases dragged on for a much longer period than 90 days. And the reasons for the delay, for the most part, can be directly ascribed to Judge Floro himself. From the records, it would seem that not only did Judge Floro move for several re-settings of the hearings of his cases; he likewise dragged his feet with respect to the order to submit himself to the appropriate psychological/mental examination. Worse, what started out as single case against him ballooned into 10 cases which were consolidated into one due to common questions of fact and law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> All in all, Judge Floro filed seven cases against those he perceived had connived to remove and/or suspend him from office, the last of which he filed on 19 May 2003 against Justice Ramirez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>Be that as it may, EQUITY demands that we exercise utmost compassion in this case considering that the rules on preventive suspension of judges, not having been expressly included in the Rules of Court, are amorphous at best. We have ruled similarly in the case of Judge Philbert Iturralde, thus:<br><blockquote>Be that as it may, we cannot in conscience hold that a judge who was placed under preventive suspension pending investigation is not entitled to the payment of back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits for the entire duration of the preventive suspension. The inequity of the doctrine as applied to judges is clearly apparent, given the peculiar circumstance in which a judge finds himself preventively suspended by the Court "until further orders".<br><br>In this case, Judge Iturralde was preventively suspended for 13½ months, during which period he was not paid his salaries, allowances and other benefits. Except for a teaching job that the Court permitted him to undertake pending resolution of the administrative case, Judge Iturralde had no other source of income. He thus incurred several loans to provide for his family's basic needs.<br><br>It would thus be unjust to deprive Judge Iturralde of his back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits for the entire period that he was preventively suspended. As we have said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gloria v. Court of Appeals</span>, preventive suspension pending investigation is not a penalty but only a measure intended to enable the disciplining authority to conduct an unhampered formal investigation. We held that ninety (90) days is ample time to conclude the investigation of an administrative case. Beyond ninety (90) days, the preventive suspension is no longer justified. Hence, for purposes of determining the extent of back salaries, allowances and other benefits that a judge may receive during the period of his preventive suspension, we hold that the ninety-day maximum period set in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gloria v. Court of Appeals,</span> should likewise be applied.<br><br>Concededly, there may be instances when an investigation would extend beyond ninety (90) days and such may not be entirely unjustified. Nevertheless, we believe that in such a situation, it would be unfair to withhold his salaries and other economic benefits for the entire duration of the preventive suspension, moreso if the delay in the resolution of the case was not due to his fault. Upon being found innocent of the administrative charge, his preventive suspension exceeding the ninety-day (90) period actually becomes without basis and would indeed be nothing short of punitive. It must be emphasized that his subsequent acquittal completely removed the cause for his preventive suspension in the first place. Necessarily, therefore, we must rectify its effects on just and equitable grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup><br></blockquote>Taking off from the case of Judge Iturralde, we hold that Judge Floro is likewise entitled to the payment of back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits being at the receiving end of a rule peculiar to judges who find themselves preventively suspended by the Court "until further orders" or, as this case, "for the duration of the investigation." Judge Iturralde's suspension of 13 ½<span class="__mozilla-findbar-search" style="padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit;"></span> months even pales in comparison to Judge Floro's suspension of 81 months, more or less. During this entire excruciating period of waiting, Judge Floro could not practice his profession, thus putting him solely at the mercy of his brother's largesse. And, though he was given donations by those who came to him for healing, obviously, these could not compensate for his loss of income as Judge.<br><br>Unlike the case of Judge Iturralde, however, wherein we held that the period of suspension exceeding 90 days should be the basis for the payment of back salaries, we hold that, as a matter of equity, Judge Floro is entitled to back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits for a period corresponding to three of his almost seven years suspension. We cannot apply the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gloria </span>that any suspension served beyond 90 days must be compensated as we would be, in effect, rewarding Judge Floro's propensity to delay the resolution of his case through the indiscriminate filing of administrative cases against those he perceived connived to oust him out of office. In Judge Iturralde's case, the investigation was not delayed through any fault of his. More importantly, Judge Iturralde was ultimately held innocent, thus, using by analogy<span style="font-style: italic;"> Gloria v. Court of Appeals,</span> his suspension in excess of 90 days was already in the nature of a penalty which cannot be countenanced precisely because, being innocent, he cannot be penalized. Judge Floro, on the other hand, and as already discussed, contributed to the delay in the investigation of his cases. Moreover, unlike Judge Iturralde, Judge Floro has not been adjudged innocent of all the 13 charges against him.<br><br>These facts, however, as we have already discussed, do not put Judge Floro beyond the reach of equity. To paraphrase Justice Brandeis, equity does not demand that its suitors are free of blame. As we are wont to say:<br><blockquote>Equity as the complement of legal jurisdiction seeks to reach and do complete justice where courts of law, through the inflexibility of their rules and want of power to adapt their judgments to the special circumstances of cases, are incompetent so to do. Equity regards the spirit of and not the letter, the intent and not the form, the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is variously expressed by different courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, notwithstanding the fact that Judge Floro is much to blame for the delay in the resolution of his case, equitable considerations constrain us to award him back salaries, allowances and other economic benefits for a period corresponding to three years. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is because Judge Floro's separation from the service is not a penalty as we ordinarily understand the word to mean. It is imposed instead upon Judge Floro out of necessity due to a medically disabling condition of the mind which renders him unfit, at least at present, to continue discharging the functions of his office.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>The period of three years seems to us the most equitable under the circumstances. As discussed, if we were to give him more than three years of back salaries, etc., then it would seem that we are rewarding him for his role in delaying the resolution of these cases (as well as the seven cases he filed which were only dismissed on 14 February 2006 at his own bidding). On the other hand, if we were to peg the period at less than three years then the same would only be a pittance compared to the seven years suspension he had to live through with Damocles' sword hanging over his head and with his hands bound as he could not practice his profession.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Judge Floro's separation from the service moots the case against him docketed as A.M.

Judge Floro contended that upon his assumption of office he came to know of the rampant corruption in the Malabon, RTC, of the judicial employees thereat and of the prosecutors. He had a bitter quarrel with Judge Aquino, Jr. due to the unwarranted unloading of cases to his sala aside from other corrupt practices of the latter. Likewise, he had a bitter quarrel with his own Clerk of Court due to these corrupt practices. Thus, to protect himself, he requested for the audit of his sala. The audit was conducted on March 2-3, 1999. Atty. Buenaventura, the audit team leader, submitted her report on 12 March 1999 to respondent Court Administrator Benipayo. Consequently, Court Administrator Benipayo submitted his report and recommendation for Judge Floro's indefinite preventive suspension to the Supreme Court. Furthermore, Judge Floro assailed as unconstitutional, void and illegal Court Administrator Benipayo's report and recommendation to the Supreme Court for his indefinite preventive suspension.
