				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Bureau of Lands awarded on May 13, 1966 to Narcisa A. Placino (Narcisa) a parcel of land identified as Lot No. 10 (the lot) located at Saint Anthony Road, Dominican-Mirador Barangay, Baguio City.<br><br>Francisco Niño (Niño), one of the herein respondents, who has been occupying the lot, contested the award by filing a Petition Protest on December 23, 1975 before the Bureau of Lands.<br><br>The Director of Lands dismissed the Petition Protest by Order of November 11, 1976.<br><br>Niño appealed the dismissal all the way to the Supreme Court but he did not succeed.<br><br>The decision of the Director of Lands dated November 11, 1976 having become final and executory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the then-Executive Director of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Cordillera Autonomous Region (DENR-CAR), on petition of Narcisa, issued an Order of Execution dated February 1, 1993 directing the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) Officer to enforce the decision "by ordering Petitioner Niño and those acting in his behalf to refrain from continuously occupying the area and remove whatever improvements they may have introduced thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Attempts to enforce the Order of Execution failed, prompting Narcisa to file a complaint for ejectment before the Baguio City Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC).  The MTCC dismissed Narcisa's complaint, however, by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of August 7, 1996.<br><br>Narcisa's counsel, Atty. Edilberto Claravall (Atty. Claravall), later petitioned the DENR-CAR for the issuance of a Special Order authorizing the City Sheriff of Baguio, the City Police Station, and the Demolition Team of the City Government to demolish or remove the improvements on the lot introduced by Niño.  The DENR-CAR denied the petition, citing lack of jurisdiction over the City Sheriff of Baguio, the City Police Station, and the Demolition Team of the City Government.  The DENR-CAR also invoked Section 14 (now Section 10 (d)) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Atty. Claravall thereupon moved to have the Order of Execution previously issued by the DENR-CAR amended, which was granted.  As amended, the Order of Execution addressed to the CENRO Officer read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, pursuant to the provisions of Section 1844 of the Revised Administrative Code as amended by Act No. 3077, you are hereby enjoined to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">enforce the aforementioned order, with the assistance upon request of the City Sheriff of Baguio City, the Demolition Team of Baguio City and the Baguio City Police Station, </span>by Ordering Petitioner Niño and those acting in his behalf to refrain from continuously occupying the area and <span style="font-weight: bold;">remove whatever improvements they may have introduced thereto.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>x x x x<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The DENR-CENRO, together with the Demolition Team of Baguio City and the Baguio City police, desisted, however, in their earlier attempt to enforce the Amended Order of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On July 16, 1997, the Demolition Team of Baguio City headed by Engineer Orlando Genove and  the Baguio City Police, on orders of then Baguio City Police Officer-In-Charge (OIC) Donato Bacquian, started demolishing the houses of Niño and his herein co-respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The demolition was, however, temporarily stopped upon the instructions of DENR-CENR Officer Guillermo Fianza, who later advised Niño that the DENR-CENRO would implement the Amended Order of Execution on August 4, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Niño and his wife Josefina Niño thereupon filed a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> for Certiorari and Prohibition with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City against Guillermo Fianza, Teofilo Olimpo of the DENR-CENRO, Mayor Mauricio Domogan (hereafter petitioner), Atty. Claravall, Engr. Orlando Genove (hereafter petitioner), Rolando Angara, and Police Officer Donato Bacquian challenging the Amended Order of Execution issued by the DENR-CENRO.<br><br>The Niño spouses later filed an Amended Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> by impleading Emmanuel Niño and Eurlie Ocampo as therein co-petitioners and the City of Baguio (hereafter petitioner) and Narcisa as therein additional respondents, and further praying for damages.<br><br>Branch 6 of the Baguio RTC dismissed the petition of Niño et al.

(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>applies.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Thus disposed the appellate court:<br></div><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby GRANTED and the Orders dated September 24, 1997 and November 23, 1998 are hereby SET ASIDE.  Public respondent City Mayor Mauricio Domogan thru the Demolition Team and City Engineer's Office are hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ordered to cease and desist from enforcing the amended order of execution</span> issued by Oscar N. Hamada, Regional Executive Director of the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, concerning the demolition or removal of the structures made by petitioners until private respondent applied for a special order abovementioned with the proper court.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Respondents filed before the appellate court an Ex-Parte Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on January 9, 2003, alleging that some of the reliefs they prayed for in their petition were left unacted upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  Petitioners too filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> on January 28, 2003, raising the following grounds:<br><blockquote><ol><li>THE HONORABLE COURT FAILED TO CONSIDER THAT THE<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING DUE COURSE TO THE PETITION FOR REVIEW;<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MISAPPLIED SEC. 10 (d), RULE 39 of the RULES OF COURT</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>In support of the first ground, petitioners raised before the appellate court, in their Motion for Reconsideration,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> for the first time</span>, the power of the City Mayor to validly order the demolition of a structure constructed without a building permit pursuant to Sec. 455(b) 3(vi) of the Local Government Code of 1991 in relation to the National Building Code of the Philippines.<br><br>Alleging that respondents built their house without the required entry and building permits, petitioners argued that the City Mayor may order the demolition of a house without a special court order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals denied both parties' motions for reconsideration by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of December 17, 2003.<br><br>Hence, the present petition of the City of Baguio, Mayor Domogan (now a Congressman), and Orlando Genove, faulting the appellate court:<br><blockquote><ol><li>. . .IN RULING THAT A SPECIAL COURT ORDER IS NEEDED FOR THE DEMOLITION OF RESPONDENTS' STRUCTURES;<br><br></li><li>. . . . IN APPLYING SEC. 10(d) RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT IN THIS CASE;<br><br></li><li>. . . . IN ENTERTAINING RESPONDENTS' PETITION FOR REVIEW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The petition fails.<br><br>While it is noted that respondent's appeal to the Court of Appeals was erroneously brought under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, instead of under Rule 41, the RTC having rendered the questioned decision in the exercise of its original, not appellate, jurisdiction, this Court overlooks the error in view of the merits of respondents' case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' contention that the enforcement of the Amended Order of Execution does not need a hearing and court order which Sec. 10(d) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court requires does not lie.  That an administrative agency which is clothed with quasi-judicial functions issued the Amended Order of Execution is of no moment, since the requirement in Sec. 10 (d) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court echoes the constitutional provision that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Antipolo Realty Corporation v. National Housing Authority</span> teaches:<br><blockquote>In general, the quantum of judicial or quasi-judicial powers which an administrative agency may exercise is defined in the enabling act of such agency.  In other words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the extent to which an administrative entity may exercise such powers depends largely, if not wholly, on the provisions of the statute creating or empowering such agency.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>There is, however, no explicit provision granting the Bureau of Lands (now the Land Management Bureau) or the DENR (which exercises control over the Land Management Bureau) the authority to issue an order of demolition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> " which the Amended Order of Execution, in substance, is.<br><br>Indeed,<br><blockquote>[w]hile the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands is confined to the determination of the respective rights of rival claimants to public lands or to cases which involve the disposition of public lands, t<span style="font-weight: bold;">he power to determine who has the actual, physical possession or occupation or the better right of possession over public lands remains with the courts.</span><br><br>The rationale is evident.  The Bureau of Lands does not have the wherewithal to police public lands.  Neither does it have the means to prevent disorders or breaches of peace among the occupants.  Its power is clearly limited to disposition and alienation and while it may decide disputes over possession, this is but in aid of making the proper awards. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The ultimate power to resolve conflicts of possession is recognized to be within the legal competence of the civil courts and its purpose is to extend protection to the actual possessors and occupants with a view to quell social unrest.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote>Consequently, this Court held:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the power to order the sheriff to remove improvements and turn over the possession of the land to the party adjudged entitled thereto, belongs only to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">courts of justice</span> and not to the Bureau of Lands</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In fine, it is the court sheriff which is empowered to remove improvements introduced by respondents on, and turn over possession of, the lot to Narcisa.<br><br>Petitioners' invocation of the City Mayor's authority under Sec. 455(b) 3(vi) of the Local Government Code to order the demolition or removal of an illegally constructed house, building, or structure within the period prescribed by law or ordinance and their allegation that respondents' structures were constructed without building permits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> were not raised before the trial court.  Petitioners having, for the first time, invoked said section of the Local Government Code and respondents' lack of building entry permits in their Motion for Reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' decision, it was correctly denied of merit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it being settled that matters, theories or arguments not brought out in the proceedings below will ordinarily not be considered by a reviewing court as they cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.
