				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By a contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> forged on January 21, 1999, petitioner NYK Ship Management (HK) Ltd., through its local manning agent-co-petitioner NYK-Fil Ship Management, Inc., hired Lauro A. Hernandez (respondent) as a boatswain on board the vessel S.S. LNG FLORA for a period of eight months.<br><br>Before the contract was executed, respondent was made    to  undergo the routine Pre-employment  Medical  Examination<br><br>(PEME) and was found to be fit to work by the attending physician, Dr. Clarissa M. Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>   On the query contained in the medical history portion as to whether he was suffering from or had been told that he had any disease or ailment, including "rheumatism, joint or back trouble,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> respondent answered in the negative.<br><br>On January 28, 1999, respondent boarded the above-named vessel and commenced to perform his duty as boatswain.<br><br>Twenty-five days later or on February 22, 1999, while the vessel was approaching Davao City, respondent requested for medical attention due to high fever and pains at his left hip bone socket.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  He was immediately brought to the Davao Doctors Hospital and before the attending physician, Dr. C. Serrano, he disclosed that he had been experiencing "fever since January 17, 1999, moderate to high grade, intermittent, associated with chills, body malaise and pain on lumbosacral area radiating to left lower extremity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The initial impression of his condition was that he was suffering from left gluteal abcess and septic arthritis left hip.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Despite the administration of, among other things,  antibiotics for five days, respondent's fever persisted along with the pain in his left lower extremity.  The vessel thus left him behind.<br><br>Respondent was thereafter transferred to Manila and was referred to petitioners' company-designated physicians at the Metropolitan Medical Hospital (MMH).  He was initially examined and admitted on March 2, 1999 and was referred to an orthopedic surgeon whose request for an x-ray of his lumbusacral spine and hip showed negative results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  He was likewise referred to a neurologist who performed EMG-NCV which showed left L4-L5 and S1 radiculopathy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Respondent also underwent MRI or magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine which showed negative results.

His latest x-ray showed no deterioration of his hip joint condition, however.<br><br>By May 1999, respondent's condition was finally determined to be <b>septic arthritis and/or avascular necrosis</b> of the left hip.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  His rehabilitation program with skin traction continued and he started taking antibiotics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On June 16, 1999, respondent's condition was re-evaluated and no significant improvement was noted.  He was referred back to the orthopedic surgeon who opined that respondent needed surgery - left hip debridement and possible total hip replacement - which was estimated to cost between P160,000 to P180,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>By early November 1999, respondent's proposed surgery was approved but despite being notified of the approval, he failed to report for scheduling thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On November 16, 1999, respondent instituted a complaint against petitioners, praying for, among others, disability compensation benefits equivalent to Grade 1 or total permanent disability amounting to $60,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  The case was docketed as NLRC OFW (M) Case No. 99-11-1946-00.<br><br>In the meantime or on February 3, 2000, respondent underwent surgical operation for a total hip replacement at the MMH. Thereafter, he continued to report to his orthopedic surgeon and was advised to continue his home exercises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In a letter dated April 28, 2000, respondent's orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Tiong Sam N. Lim, wrote the medical coordinator of the MMH regarding respondent's case, recommending that respondent's disability grading be half of grade 9 or complete inability of a hip joint in full extension of the thigh, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>THIS IS WITH REGARDS TO YOUR QUERY REGARDING THE CASE OF MR.

In the medical certificate dated June 25, 2001 issued by the attending orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Rafael Cruz Bundoc, the following pertinent portion is noted:<br><blockquote>Presently, patient is ambulant with no hip pain.  Patient however has limited range of motion over his left hip joint compared to the right, and has difficulty in squatting.  Patient also cannot move briskly in going up and down stairways, walking in ramps and embankments.  Difficulty in running is conspicuous even for very short distance.<br><br>Considering that the medical wall of his acetabulum over the operated side is thin, there is a danger that he might develop protusio acetabuli or some other attrition problems in the future.  With these clinical conditions, <u>it is not advisable for the patient to engage in manual work that would entail prolonged standing, running especially carrying heavy objects</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of October 18, 2001, the Labor Arbiter declared that respondent was entitled to disability benefits, equivalent to half of Grade 9 as found by the company-designated physician, Dr. Tiong Sam N. Lim.   Held the Arbiter:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br>As established, parties signed a POEA contract, the terms and conditions are specified therein.  One of the provisions of the contract states that the company-designated physician determines the seaman's disability grading.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br>The contract of employment specifically mentions company-designated physician.  Dr. Tiong Sam N. Lim, M.D., who opined and suggested that complainant's disability grading would be half of Grade 9 (Complete inability of a hip joint in full extension of the thigh).  To agree to the claim of complainant would be to encourage and disregard and violate the government approved contracts, in effect, promoting disrespect to government authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Arbiter thus disposed:<br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering NYK Fil Ship Management, incorporated to pay Lauro Hernandez his <u>disability benefit in the amount of US$6,530.00</u> or its equivalent in Philippine Currency at the rate of exchange prevailing of actual payment.<br><br>Other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ten percent of the award as attorney's fees</span>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>   (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Respondent appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), claiming that there was prima facie abuse of discretion on the part of the Labor Arbiter in not awarding permanent and total disability benefits, as well as moral and exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Respondent averred that there is no such thing as an impediment grade of ½ of Grade 9 under the POEA Standard Employment Contract as the company-designated physician could only choose among the impediment grades of 1 to 14.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>   He further averred that given petitioners' company-designated physician opinion that it would not be advisable for respondent to resume work as a seafarer, he is entitled to permanent total disability compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The NLRC found that while there was an interim grading of respondent's disability as suggested by the company-designated physician, petitioners were remiss in their duty to have the degree of complainant's disability assessed thereafter and while he was undergoing treatment and rehabilitation as provided in the standard employment contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The NLRC thus ruled that petitioners' negligence, coupled with the fact that the nature of the illness of respondent renders him incapable of pursuing his profession as a seafarer, sufficed to categorize respondent's disability as permanent total disability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Hence, it modified the decision of the Labor Arbiter, viz:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED. Accordingly, respondents are hereby ordered to jointly and severally pay the complainant the peso equivalent at the time of actual payment of the sum of <u>SIXTY THOUSAND US DOLLARS (US $60,000) representing total disability benefits</u>, plus ten percent thereof as and by way of attorney's fees.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> having been denied by Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of August 30, 2002, they elevated the case to the Court of Appeals on a petition for certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  of August 18, 2003, the Court of Appeals affirmed that of the NLRC.<br><br>Their motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's decision having been denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> petitioners lodged the present petition for review, faulting the appellate court as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>The Appellate Court Disregarded The Terms And Conditions Of The POEA Standard Employment Contract When It Rendered Petitioners Liable To Private Respondent Hernandez For Disability Benefits;<br><br></li><li>Corollarily, The Appellate Court Failed To Give Due Weight And Consideration To The Assessment Made By The Company-Designated Physicians As To Private Respondent Hernandez's Disability; And<br><br></li><li>The Appellate Court Found Private Respondent Hernandez With Grade 1 Disability And Awarded Him Disability Benefits In The Amount Of US$60,000.00 Which Is Equivalent To A Finding Of Total And Permanent Disability, Despite The Lack Of Any Basis Therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Petitioners contend that the appellate court failed to consider that the condition of respondent pre-existed his employment, thereby limiting, if not negating their liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>A seafarer is a contractual, not a regular employee, and his employment is contractually fixed for a certain period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  His employment, including claims for death or illness compensations, is governed by the contract he signs every time he is hired,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and is not rooted from the provisions of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Provision number 2 of respondent's employment contract specifically provides that "the terms and conditions of the revised Employment Contract governing the employment of all seafarers approved per Department order No. 33 and Memorandum Circular No. 55 both series of 1996 shall be strictly and faithfully observed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055-96 or the "Revised Standard Employment Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers On Board Ocean-going Vessels" (POEA Seafarers Contract)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> provides for the minimum requirements acceptable to the POEA for the overseas employment of a Filipino seafarer.  Section 20 (B)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of said contract enumerates the liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers injury or illness during the term of his contract.<br><blockquote>SECTION 20.

LNG FLORA for more than three weeks.<br><br>Respondent was diagnosed as suffering from avascular necrosis with septic arthritis.  <b>Septic arthritis</b> is a serious infection of the joints characterized by pain, fever, occasional chills, inflammation, and swelling in the infected joint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Infectious arthritis in the hip may be experienced as pain in the groin area that becomes worse if the patient tries to walk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In general, it is caused by the spread of a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection through the bloodstream to the joint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the most common cause being <i>neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b>Avascular necrosis</b> on the other hand is a condition in which there has been a circulatory impairment of an area of the bone, leading to its eventual death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In its early stage, physical examination of the affected area may be within normal limits, but a limp may be detected later if the lower extremity is involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  Range of motion of the affected region may be limited and may cause pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  Most of the cases involve younger adults and are associated with a variety of conditions that cause circulatory impairment, the most common among which are prolonged glucocorticoid administration and excessive alcohol intake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In <i>Sealanes Marine Services, Inc., v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court held that an employer is not liable for death compensation arising under the standard format contract if the death of the seaman was due to an illness that was not contracted during the term of his employment contract.<br><blockquote>x x x  Capt. Arante could not have contracted cancer of the pancreas while working on board the vessel for only two (2) months.  The conclusion is inevitable that when he was diagnosed to be differing from gastro-duodemitis, the same was merely the result of the metastatic spread of his original disease of cancer of the pancreas.  It cannot be said that the disease, which caused his death, occurred during his employment.  The pre-employment medical examination conduced upon him could not have divulged his disease considering the fact that most, if not all, such examinations are not so exploratory.  Therefore, it would be unfair to hold petitioners liable for the amount of death compensation provided for under the standard format contract for such award is unwarranted under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote>Thus, <u>death</u> arising from a pre-existing illness is not compensable.  A <i>fortiori</i>, <u>disability</u> arising from a pre-existing illness is not compensable.<br><br>Respondent argues, however, that prior to employment, respondent underwent a thorough PEME conducted by the company-designated physician and was pronounced "fit to work."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>While a PEME may reveal enough for petitioners to decide whether a seafarer is fit for overseas employment, it may not be relied upon to inform petitioners of a seafarer's true state of health.  The PEME could not have divulged respondent's illness considering that the examinations were not exploratory.  It was only after respondent was subjected to extensive medical procedures including MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine that respondent's illness was finally diagnosed as a case of avascular necrosis of the hip with septic arthritis.<br><br>Dr. Mendoza's memorandum dated June 29, 1999 shows  that during the PEME, respondent was only subjected to routinary chest x-ray, stool examination, and urinalysis, thus:<br><blockquote>[Respondent] was initially seen in our clinic on January 5 &amp; 6, 1999 for Pre-employment Medical Examination. At the time he denied any significant symptoms. The Physical examination chest x-ray and stool examination were unremarkable.  His urinalysis however showed trace sugar and he was required to have an FBS done. He came back on January 16, 1999 for the test which turns out to be normal. He was never seen at the clinic after that.  Enclose[d] are Xerox copies of his routine slip and laboratory results to a test to the dates mentioned.  His PEME was dated January 18, 1999 because this was the date the report was printed and forwarded to our manning center. We were never made aware of the crew that he had an illness immediately after PEME and prior to his embarkation.  And probably even manning center as it is their practice to send back to us for pre-departure check-up if there were aware that he acquired an illness after his PEME. <u>If the diagnosis is Avascular Necrosis of the hip with septic arthritis it was not apparent at the time of PEME, note also that it was not even one of the differential diagnosis when he was seen in Davao, and Metropolitan Hospital made the diagnosis only 3 months after disembarkation.  X-ray of the hip is not part of the PEME and again would like to underscore the fact that even x-ray of his hip on March 3, 1999 was normal</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>   (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>For respondent to thus claim that the issuance of a clean bill of health to a seafarer after a PEME means that his illness was acquired during the seafarer's employment is a non sequitor.<br><blockquote><u>We do not agree with the respondent's claim that by the issuance of a clean bill of health to Roberto</u>, made by the physicians selected/accredited by the petitioners, <u>it necessarily follows that the illness for which her husband died was acquired during his employment</u> as a fisherman for the petitioners.<br><br>The pre-employment medical examination conducted on Roberto could not have divulged the disease for which he died, considering the fact that most, if not all, are not so exploratory.  The disease of GFR, which is an indicator of chronic renal failure, is measured thru the renal function test.  In pre-employment examination, the urine analysis (urinalysis), which is normally included measures only the creatinine, the presence of which cannot conclusively indicate chronic renal failure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>It having been satisfactorily shown that respondent was really not fit to work as a boatswain due to his pre-existing illness and, therefore, he is not entitled to disability compensation, necessarily, he is not entitled to attorney's fees.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
