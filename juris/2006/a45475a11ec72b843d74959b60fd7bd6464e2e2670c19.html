Fast Manpower, with a bid of <strike>P</strike>974,738.90, gave the lowest bid.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Laging Qlean,</span> with a bid of <strike>P</strike>1,027,174.90, lagged behind as sixth in the list of lowest bidders..<br><br>By letter of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">October</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">20</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1992</span>, Rodolfo S.

Basa, Ditas Icalina, Yolanda Zaragoza and Rebecca A. Barbo.<br><br>Petitioner posited that the bid of <span style="font-style: italic;">Laging Qlean</span> of <strike>P</strike>1,027,174.90 for a total of 21 janitors for a one-year contract of janitorial maintenance services was the lowest complying bid and most advantageous to the government, hence, the contract should have been awarded to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Further, petitioner contended that the December 22, 1992 notice of last extension sent by LWUA violated the earlier quoted paragraph 8 of the contract as <span style="font-style: italic;">Laging Qlean</span> was in effect merely given a 12-day notice of termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>By Order of January 18, 1993, the trial court directed the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises above considered, upon filing of a bond in the sum of <strike>P</strike>50,000.00 duly approved by the Court, let a writ of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">preliminary mandatory injunction</span> be issued enjoining the defendants, their agents and/or representatives to <span style="font-weight: bold;">cancel</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the contract of janitorial services in favor of Fast Manpower and reinstate and award the contract of janitorial services in favor of Laging Qlean Janitorial Services,</span> the latter being the lowest complying bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>A Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction was accordingly issued.<br><br>Petitioner later twice moved to cite respondents for contempt of court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> for allegedly disobeying the writ when its janitors were barred from doing janitorial services on January 19, 1993.   Petitioner and respondents, however, agreed to proceed with the trial on the merits to fully apprise the court of the facts of the case before resolving the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>After trial on the merits, Branch 98 of the Quezon City RTC dismissed the complaint by Decision of March 11, 1994, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the defendants, ordering the <span style="font-weight: bold;">dismissal</span> of the herein complaint. The writ of preliminary mandatory injunction earlier issued by the court is hereby ordered lifted, and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contract for janitorial maintenance services between the Fast Manpower Services and the [L]ocal Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) shall be reinstated</span> and be enforceable between the parties. With costs against the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On appeal, the Court of Appeals narrowed down the main issue to whether the award of the contract for janitorial services to Fast Manpower was legal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>   It, however, passed on the failure of the trial court to cite respondents in contempt of court in this wise:<br><blockquote>The contract having expired by its terms on January 4, 1993, and the same can't be extended by injunction, the defendants are therefore not liable for contempt for they did not violate the injunction because the defendants did not terminate the contract but it was terminated by its own terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>By Decision of May 30, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court.  Hence, the Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> at bar faulting the appellate court of having<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>x x x COMMITTED A SERIOUS REVERSIBLE ERROR, AMOUNTING TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN NOT HOLDING RESPONDENTS GUILTY OF CONTEMPT OF COURT</span> FOR DISOBEYING THE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ISSUED BY BRANCH 98 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>x x x COMMITTED A SERIOUS REVERSIBLE ERROR, AMOUNTING TO GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION, IN AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF BRANCH 98 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY DESPITE THE <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SERIOUS ERRORS AND APPLICATION OF LAWS</span>, WHICH IF NOT RECTIFIED, WOULD CAUSE GRAVE IRREPARABLE INJURY AND DAMAGE TO HEREIN PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The first assigned error relative to the failure of the trial court as well as of the appellate court to cite respondents in contempt of court fails.<br><br>Without passing on the propriety of the issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction by the trial court, it bears noting that the parties agreed to defer the resolution of the motion to cite respondents in contempt until after trial on the merits.  Since the complaint was dismissed, resolution of the motion was rendered unnecessary.  <br><br>At all events, the appellate court or even this Court cannot, on behalf of the trial court,  cite respondents in contempt of court.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Igot v. Court of Appeals</span>, teaches:<br><blockquote>The court that granted the preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order preserving the status quo is vested with the power to hear and determine the sufficiency and merit of the contempt charge. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Only the court which issued the injunction can impose a sanction for contempt of that injunction,</span> and a court without subject matter jurisdiction cannot transfer the case to another court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied; italics in the original),<br></blockquote>as does the earlier case of <span style="font-style: italic;">San Luis v. Court of Appeals:</span><br><blockquote>"In whatever context it may arise, contempt of court involves the doing of an act, or the failure to do an act, in such a manner as to create an affront to the court and the sovereign dignity with which it is clothed. As a matter of practical judicial administration, jurisdiction has been felt to properly rest in only one tribunal at a time with respect to a given controversy." Only the court which rendered the order commanding the doing of a certain act is vested with the right to determine whether or not the order has been complied with, or whether a sufficient reason has been given for noncompliance, and, therefore, whether a contempt has been committed. It is a well-established rule that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the power to determine the existence of contempt of court rests exclusively with the court contemned. <span style="font-weight: bold;">No court is authorized to punish a contempt against another.</span></span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As regards the second issue, petitioner posits that the "notice of last extension" was in reality a notice of termination which violated the earlier quoted paragraph 8 of the contract providing for a 30-day prior notice of termination.<br><br>Petitioner's position does not persuade.<br><br>Petitioner had, as early as April 1992, become aware that the LWUA was going to conduct a bidding and that it was on that account that the contract had since been renewed on a monthly basis.  And by participating in the September 25, 1992 bidding, it was fully aware that a new contract for janitorial maintenance services would be forged as a result thereof.  Furthermore, it was advised, by letter of October 20, 1992, that its contract was being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extended</span> (not renewed) for one month, to which extension, it through Susana affixed its conformity. <br><br>Petitioner further posits that the award of the contract to Fast Manpower also violated the law on public bidding, its sole objective of which is to be fair, just and competitive.  This too does not persuade.<br><br>From the Memorandum dated November 23, 1992<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> prepared by the IHPBC, all the necessary factors were taken into account in choosing a contract which is most advantageous to the government.  Consider the following:<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.0 COMMITTEE EVALUATION AND FINDINGS</span><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.1 "Labor" Bid Portion</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All the twelve (12) bidders conformed with the minimum wage (@P118.00 per day for non-agricultural sector of the NCR) set by law.</span> The Villaseran Maintenance Services had the lowest bid for the "Labor" portion, followed by both Fast Manpower Services and Ultimate Care Services. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Laging Qlean Janitorial Services, on the other hand, quoted the highest when it comes to labor.</span> This is attributable, as can be seen in the attached Abstract of Bids, to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">higher rate of monthly SSS employer's contribution used by the Laging Qlean Janitorial Services compared to the rate used by the rest of the bidders (P177.30 vs. P152.00). Laging Qlean apparently opted to include the 13th month pay in computing the SSS premium, which the other bidders did not.</span><br><br>To verify the correct amount of monthly SSS premium contribution a private employer should remit, a letter of inquiry dated October 19, 1992, was sent by the IHPBC Chairman to the Social Security System <span style="font-weight: bold;">(ANNEX C).</span> From the response of the Chief, Correspondence Section of the Member Assistance Group of the SSS, Mr. Jovenito F. Tagoc dated October 21, 1992 <span style="font-weight: bold;">(ANNEX D)</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the right amount for monthly SSS employer's contribution should have been </span><strike style="font-weight: bold;">P</strike><span style="font-weight: bold;">152.</span><br><br>x x x x<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.4 Total Bid Price</span><br><br>In totality, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fast Manpower Services is the lowest complying bidder</span> from among the twelve (12) prequalified contractors. As part of the post-qualification evaluation, the Committee sent letters to the present government clients of Fast Manpower Services to verify its latest annual performance with other companies. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">From among the list of Fast Manpower's clients, the Committee chose four (4) government agencies for this purpose,</span> namely: (1) the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, (2) Philippine Heart Center, (3) Lung Center of the Philippines, and (4) the Social Security System, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all of which gave very satisfactory remarks on the Fast Manpower's performance</span> (refer to <span style="font-weight: bold;">ANNEX G</span>). The same proves the credibility Fast Manpower Services has established with their present clients.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. 0 COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS</span><br><br>3.1 The LWUA Janitorial Services Contract for one year is hereby recommended for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">award to the FAST MANPOWER SERVICES for the following reasons:</span><br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">3.1.1 Fast Manpower Services has the most <span style="text-decoration: underline;">economical bid that is most advantageous to LWUA</span> among the twelve (12) bidders, in the amount of NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY NINE AND 30/100 PESOS ONLY (P974,739.30), including taxes, subject to compliance with the usual administrative and legal requirements; and<br>3.1.2 Fast Manpower Services has proven to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a responsive (i.e., in the sense that it has a record of complying with its contractual commitments) and credible contractor</span>, based on the results of a postqualification inquiry with four (4) big government institutions as respondents.<br></div><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Further, LWUA made a reservation to reject bids as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Invitation to Prequalify</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">and Bid</span> published in the June 6, 1992 issue of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Daily Inquirer</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> shows:<br><blockquote>LWUA <span style="font-weight: bold;">reserves</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the right <span style="font-weight: bold;">to reject any or all the bids</span></span>, to waive any formality found therein and to accept such bid or a part thereof as may be deemed most advantageous to LWUA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The discourse in his "A TREATISE ON GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS UNDER PHILIPPINE LAW" of former Commissioner of the Commission on Audit Bartolome C. Fernandez, Jr. is enlightening:<br><blockquote>It is a settled rule that where the invitation to bid contains a reservation for the Government to reject any or all bids, the lowest or highest bidder, as the case may be, is not entitled to an award as a matter of right for it does not become the ministerial duty of the Government to make such award. Thus, it has been held that where the right to reject is so reserved, the lowest bid or any bid for that matter may be rejected on a mere technicality, that all bids may be rejected, even if arbitrarily and unwisely, or under a mistake, and that in the exercise of a sound discretion, the award may be made to another than the lowest bidder. And so, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where the Government as advertiser, availing itself of that right, makes its choice in rejecting any or all bids, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the losing bidder has no cause to complain nor right to dispute that choice, unless an unfairness or injustice is shown.</span> Accordingly, he has no ground of action to compel the Government to award the contract in his favor, nor to compel it to accept his bid.</span><br><br>Verily, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a <span style="font-weight: bold;">reservation</span> in the advertisement for bids of the right to reject any bid <span style="font-weight: bold;">generally vests in the authorities a wide discretion</span> as to who is the best and most advantageous bidder.</span> The exercise of such discretion involves inquiry, investigation, comparison, deliberation and decision, which are quasi-judicial functions, and when honestly performed, may not be reviewed by the courts. In such cases, there is no binding obligation to award the contract to any bidder and in the exercise of such discretion the award may be made validly to whoever among the participating bidders has submitted the most advantageous bid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Citations omitted) (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Contrary then to the assertion of petitioner, the bidding was carried out in accordance with its purpose of protecting public interest by giving the public the best possible advantages through open competition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
