				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00474 which affirmed <i>in toto </i>the judgment of Branch 172, Regional Trial Court, Valenzuela City in Criminal Case Nos. 676-V-00 and 677-V-00 finding appellant Alex Candaza y Calvadores guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of simple rape and acts of lasciviousness.<br><br>The prosecution's version of the antecedent facts is as follows:<br><br>At around three o'clock in the afternoon of June 18, 2000, the then 13-year old victim, Kristine Dorado, was alone sleeping in their house at No. 395 Rico Compound, Barangay Palasan, Valenzuela City, when she was awakened by somebody's presence.&nbsp; Upon opening her eyes, she saw her neighbor, appellant Alex Candaza, standing behind her. &nbsp;Kristine was about to stand up when appellant, who was drunk, held her shoulders and told her to remain lying down. &nbsp;Appellant then pinned Kristine down by putting both his hands around her neck. &nbsp;He subsequently released his right hand from Kristine's neck and removed her short pants and underwear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Kristine tried to free herself but appellant was too strong.<br><br>While warning Kristine not to report the incident to anyone, appellant removed his own short pants and briefs. &nbsp;He thereafter mounted the girl, inserted his penis into her vagina and lay motionless on top of her for five minutes. &nbsp;He also mashed her breasts and kissed her lips. &nbsp;Because of his relative strength, Kristine failed to ward off appellant's sexual advances.<br><br>Subsequently, Kristine asked appellant to stop, pushed him aside and stood up. &nbsp;Before she could leave the house, however, appellant threatened to kill her family if she would report the incident to anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Kristine's sordid encounter with appellant did not prove to be the last. On August 12, 2000, she woke up at 10:30 in the evening to fix the water containers in their yard, when appellant suddenly approached her. &nbsp;He told Kristine not to go to sleep yet but when she refused, he held her shoulders and slapped her. &nbsp;Afterwards, he led her to a nearby bench, instructed her to sit down and proceeded to undress her. &nbsp;He subsequently kissed her on the lips, licked her vagina and mashed her breasts. &nbsp;Kristine tried to push appellant away but could not do so. &nbsp;After a while, appellant stopped.<br><br>Kristine then put on her clothes and wept. &nbsp;Appellant sat beside her and placed his hand on her shoulders. &nbsp;Again, he told Kristine not to report the incident to anyone or he would kill her family. No one saw them since the place was dark and there were no light posts around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Six days later, Kristine's father, Arturo Dorado, Jr., looked for Kristine and found her crying in the house of her aunt, Jenny Tenorio, who lived three houses away. &nbsp;At that time, Kristine had already told her aunt that appellant raped her. &nbsp;But when Kristine could not bring herself to reveal the incidents to her father, Arturo asked a <i>barangay </i>volunteer, Rolando Hernandez, to speak to his daughter. &nbsp;It was then that Kristine related what appellant did to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Kristine was thus brought to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Women and Children Concern Office (WACCO) at Camp Crame, Quezon City where she executed a sworn written statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> &nbsp;She was also brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory where a medico-legal examination was conducted by Dr. Winston Tan who issued a medico-legal report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated August 18, 2000 with the following findings:<blockquote>Hymen: presence of deep healed laceration at 3 o'clock position.<br><br>x x x x&nbsp;<br><br>Conclusion: Subject is in non-virgin state physically.<br><br>There are no external signs of application of any form of trauma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>On August 21, 2000, two separate informations for rape and acts of lasciviousness were filed against appellant before the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela City, respectively docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 676-V-00 and 677-V-00 and raffled to Branch 172 presided by Judge Floro P. Alejo. The information in Criminal Case No. 676-V-00 alleged:<blockquote>That on or about the 18<sup>th</sup> day of June 2000, in the City of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one KRISTINE DORADO, 14 years old (minor).<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Meanwhile, the information in Criminal Case No. 677-V-00 stated:<blockquote>That on or about the 12<sup>th</sup> day of August 2000, in the City of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit act of lasciviousness, upon the person of one KRISTINE DORADO, 14 years old (minor) by licking her vagina and mashing her breast.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Appellant interposed a negative plea to both charges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> after which trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>Appellant denied the criminal acts imputed to him. &nbsp;He averred that at the day and time that the alleged rape transpired, he was inside their house resting with his live-in partner, Melissa Abarico, and their one-year old child. &nbsp;He was then very tired as he had just come home from work.<br><br>On the other hand, he was in Caloocan City at the place of his employer, Engineer Hector Cornejo, at around 10:30 in the evening of August 12, 2000. &nbsp;He worked overtime and it was only at about 11:00 in the evening that he left his place of work.<br><br>Abarico and Cornejo corroborated appellant's alibi.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> &nbsp;Another defense witness, Renato Candazo, claimed that at the day and time of the alleged rape, he was in the house with appellant and the latter's family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>According to appellant, Kristine may have filed the cases against him because she had a crush on him and did not want him to take Abarico as his common-law wife. &nbsp;Kristine allegedly showed interest in him by always approaching him and touching his head. &nbsp;He allegedly told Kristine to stay away from him because she was too young.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In due course, the trial court rendered judgment convicting appellant thus:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1)&nbsp;In Crim. Case No. 676-V-00, the Court finds accused ALEX CANDAZA y CALVADORES guilty beyond reasonable doubt and as principal of the crime of rape in relation to Republic Act 7610 as defined and penalized under Article 266-A, par. 1(a) and Article 266-B, 1st par. of the Revised Penal Code, without any attending mitigating or aggravating circumstance, and hereby sentences him to <u>reclusion perpetua</u>. The accused is further sentenced to pay Kristine Dorado the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages and to indemnify said complaining witness the amount of P50,000.00, both without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. &nbsp;Finally, the accused is sentenced to pay the costs of suit.<br><br>2)&nbsp;In Crim. Case No. 677-V-00, the Court finds accused ALEX CANDAZA y CALVADORES guilty beyond reasonable doubt and as principal of the crime of acts of lasciviousness as defined and penalized under Article III, par. 5(b) of Republic Act 7160 without any attending mitigating or aggravating circumstance and, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, hereby sentences him to suffer a penalty of TWELVE (12) YEARS and FOUR (4) MONTHS of <u>reclusion temporal</u> as minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY OF <u>reclusion temporal</u> as maximum. The accused is further sentenced to pay Kristine Dorado the amount of P30,000.00 as moral damages and to indemnify said complaining witness the amount of P30,000.00, both without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. Finally, the accused is sentenced to pay the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>In view of the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>imposed on appellant, the cases were at first directly elevated to this Court for review. &nbsp;Subsequently, however, these were referred to the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> pursuant to our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> &nbsp;The appellate court eventually rendered the assailed decision dated September 28, 2005, affirming the trial court <i>in toto</i>. &nbsp;Hence, the instant appeal.<br><br>On February 8, 2006, the Court required the parties to simultaneously submit their respective supplemental briefs if they so desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> &nbsp;Both parties manifested that they shall adopt their briefs filed before the appellate court in order to avoid repetition of their arguments and to expedite the resolution of the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> &nbsp;Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted for decision.&nbsp;<br><br>Appellant contends that he could not be convicted under the two informations which, he claims, are defective. &nbsp;The information in Criminal Case No. 676-V-00 did not allege "force and intimidation", which is an essential element of the crime of rape, while the information in Criminal Case No. 677-V-00 failed to allege "coercion" as an essential element of acts of lasciviousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In addition, appellant maintains that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. &nbsp;He questions Kristine's credibility on the ground that her account of the events is contrary to human experience. &nbsp;He asserts that it would have been unnatural for him to lie motionless on top of Kristine for five minutes after he had fully penetrated the latter. &nbsp;Likewise, it was improbable that he would commit lascivious acts against Kristine in front of her house where her father and sisters were sleeping. &nbsp;Unless he was so sure that Kristine would not make any noise or summon her father, he would not dare expose himself to the danger of being caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i>.<br><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>In <i>People v. Galido</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court held that the failure to allege the element of force and intimidation in an information for rape is not a fatal omission that would deprive the accused of the right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him. &nbsp;This is based on the fact that the offended party's sworn written complaint specifically charged the accused with rape through force and intimidation, which gave the latter the opportunity to readily ascertain at the outset what crime he is being charged with. &nbsp;In other words, although the information failed to allege this essential element, the complaint, as in this case, nonetheless stated the ultimate facts which constitute the offense; and since the complaint forms part of the records and is furnished the accused, the latter may still suitably prepare his defense and answer the criminal charges hurled against him.<br><br>We also held in <i>People v. Palarca</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> that the failure of the accused to interpose any objection to the presentation of evidence which tended to prove the element of force and intimidation constitutes a waiver of his right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him. &nbsp;Any insufficiency in the allegations in the information should be raised prior to arraignment by filing a motion to quash, otherwise the accused is deemed to have waived any objection on such ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> &nbsp;This is consistent with the omnibus motion rule embodied in Section 9, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Consequently, it is now too late for appellant to assail the sufficiency of the informations on the ground that there was failure to allege therein an essential element of the crime. &nbsp;An information which lacks essential allegations may still sustain a conviction when the accused fails to object to its sufficiency during the trial, and the deficiency was cured by competent evidence presented therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> &nbsp;In the instant case, appellant did not question the sufficiency of the informations at any time that the criminal cases were pending before the trial court. &nbsp;Neither did he object to the evidence of the prosecution which proved the elements of force and intimidation, as well as coercion, in the commission of the two offenses. &nbsp;He is thus deemed to have waived any objections against the sufficiency of the informations.<br><br>On appellant's indictment for rape through force and intimidation, the victim in this case testified as follows:<blockquote><dl><dt>FISCAL BORNASAL:</dt><dd>Miss Witness on June 18, 2000 at around 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon do you recall where you were?</dd></dl><table><tbody><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>I was inside our house, sir.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">x x x x<br><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">What were you doing Miss Witness on June 18, 2000 at around 3:00 p.m.?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">I was sleeping, sir.<br><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">So while you were sleeping were you awaken from your sleep?</td></tr></tbody></table><dl><dt>ATTY.

immature girls, as in this case, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed if the matter about which they testified is not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> &nbsp;Moreover, no young woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellant's assertion that Kristine filed these cases against him because she did not want him to have a common-law wife is hard to believe. &nbsp;It is inconceivable that she would fabricate the charges only because she has a crush on appellant. &nbsp;When a woman, or a young girl, cries rape, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her. &nbsp;So long as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Neither are we convinced of appellant's alibis. &nbsp;His witnesses, in the person of Abarico, Cornejo and Candazo, could not have possibly remembered with exactitude the events which transpired on the days in question, because the activities they described are so commonplace that these could have happened on any other day.<br><br>Candazo testified that on the day and at the time that the rape was allegedly committed, he was in appellant's house watching "betamax" tapes with the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> &nbsp;On the other hand, Abarico claimed that, on the same day and time, appellant was resting with her in their house. &nbsp;As for Cornejo, he averred that appellant rendered overtime work for him on the night of August 12, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>We can only regard with suspicion the testimony of the defense witnesses since they could hardly be supposed to have noticed or charged their memory with these events, when there was no special reason why they should observe it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> &nbsp;There was nothing that could fix these days and times in their minds, as to facilitate absolute recollection of the events which transpired.<br><br>Moreover, as against appellant's denial and alibi, the victim's positive testimonies must necessarily prevail. &nbsp;Denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses and constitute self-serving negative evidence which can not be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the positive declaration of credible witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Thus, we agree with the trial court that the prosecution evidence is more credible in this case. &nbsp;It is well-settled that the evaluation of the witnesses' credibility is a matter best left to the trial court, because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude.&nbsp; &nbsp;Findings of the trial court on such matters are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> &nbsp;No such facts or circumstances exist in the case at bar.&nbsp;<br><br>Appellant's contention that it was highly improbable for him to lie motionless for five minutes on top of Kristine after he had fully penetrated the latter deserves short shrift. &nbsp;Suffice it to say that, just as there are no fixed standards by which victims may react to a sexual trauma, we cannot likewise reasonably assume that perpetrators of crimes would consummate offenses in the usual, expected manner.&nbsp; Similarly, it is not implausible for appellant to have committed the lascivious acts complained of in front of the victim' house. &nbsp;Lust, as we have often held, is no respecter of either place or time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>All told, we are convinced beyond reasonable doubt that appellant committed the crimes imputed to him. The prosecution adequately discharged its burden of proving all the essential elements of simple rape under Article 266-A (1)(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, namely: (a) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) that the same was committed by using force and intimidation. &nbsp;<br><br>Likewise, the prosecution proved that appellant committed acts of lasciviousness upon the victim under Article III, Section 5(b) of RA 7610.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Kristine, who was 13 years old when the criminal acts complained of occurred, was sexually abused by appellant since she was coerced and intimidated by the latter to indulge in lascivious conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As correctly found by the trial court, the penalty for simple rape through force and intimidation is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> &nbsp;Civil indemnity and moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each are also awarded to victims of rape in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>However, the penalty for acts of lasciviousness performed on a child under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 is <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty to be imposed on appellant should thus fall within the range of <i>prision mayor </i>medium to <i>reclusion temporal </i>minimum, as minimum, to <i>reclusion temporal </i>maximum, as maximum. &nbsp;Hence, appellant is sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor </i>as minimum to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal </i>as maximum. &nbsp;Consistent with previous rulings of the Court, appellant must also indemnify the victim in the amount of P15,000.00 as moral damages and pay a fine in the same amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
