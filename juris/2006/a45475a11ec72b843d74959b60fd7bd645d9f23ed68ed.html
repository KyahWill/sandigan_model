				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The present Petition for Review on Certiorari seeks a relaxation of the Rules on verification and certification against forum shopping, petitioner's Petition for Review of a Civil Service Commission Resolution having been dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by the appellate court for failure to comply therewith.<br><br>On October 10, 1983, Erneliza Mamaril (petitioner) was hired by the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) as Stenographic Reporter on a temporary status. On March 15, 1984, she was promoted to Administrative Assistant II, a permanent position. In 1992, then DOTC Secretary Jesus B. Garcia, Jr. appointed her as Department Legislative Liaison Specialist (DLLS), a coterminous position. Her appointment as DLLS was renewed by the succeeding DOTC Secretaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On December 19, 2000, then DOTC Secretary Vicente C.

She concludes that she having been "illegally dismissed," she must not only be reinstated but must be entitled to all the rights and privileges that accrued to her by virtue of the office she held, such as her right to back salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 7 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure lay down the rules on verification and certification against forum shopping as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Verification.</span> - Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath, verified or accompanied by affidavit.<br><br>A pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and correct of his personal knowledge or based on authentic records.<br><br>A pleading required to be verified which contains a verification based on "information and belief" or upon "knowledge, information, and belief," or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading. (As amended, A.M. No. 00-2-10 SC, May 1, 2000.)<br><br>SEC. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Certification against forum shopping</span>. - The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing.</span> The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions." (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The purpose of requiring a verification is to secure an assurance that the allegations of the petition have been made in good faith, or are true and correct, not merely speculative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  Non-compliance with such requirement does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective, hence, the court may order its correction if verification is lacking, or act on the pleading although it is not verified if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rules may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may thereby be served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the rule against forum shopping is rooted in the principle that a party-litigant shall not be allowed to pursue simultaneous remedies in different fora, as this practice is detrimental to orderly judicial procedure. The lack of certification against forum shopping, unlike that of verification, is <span style="font-style: italic;">generally</span> not curable by the submission thereof after the filing of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  The submission of a certificate against forum shopping is thus deemed obligatory, albeit not jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The rule on certification against forum shopping may, however, be also relaxed on grounds of "substantial compliance" or "special circumstance or compelling reasons." The Court thus examined the records of the case on hand to determine the existence of any circumstances or compelling reasons which call for the relaxation of the Rules but appreciated none in light of the following discussion.<br><br>The general proposition is that a public official is not entitled to any compensation if he has not rendered any service. As he works, so shall he earn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Compensation is paid only for service actually or constructively rendered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's services were actually terminated on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">September 1, 2001,</span> after the CSC issued Resolution No. 01-1409 dated August 20, 2001 declaring that "the previous incumbents of the two Department Legislative Liaison Specialist (DLLS) positions were no longer existing employees as of the date said positions were declared by the Commission as career."  She was, however, reinstated on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 26, 2002</span> after the CSC issued on even date Resolution No. 02-1504 setting aside Resolution No. 01-1409.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Octot v. Ybañez</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> instructs that the good faith or bad faith and grave abuse of discretion in the dismissal or termination of the services of a government employee come into play in the determination of the award of back salaries upon his reinstatement.  In said case, the therein petitioner, a security guard in the Regional Health Office No. VII, Cebu City who had been convicted of libel by a trial court, was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">summarily</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dismissed</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pursuant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presidential</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decree</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">LOI</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nos.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">14-A</span> issued by then President Marcos directing heads of departments and agencies of the government to weed out undesirable government officials and employees, specifically those who were facing charges or were notoriously undesirable on the ground of dishonesty, incompetence or other kinds of misconduct defined in the Civil Service Law.  The therein petitioner was eventually acquitted of the criminal charge. Hence, his request for reinstatement was granted but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">claim</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">back</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">salaries</span> from the date of his dismissal. This Court, through then Chief Justice Teehankee, held:<br><blockquote>In the absence of proof that respondent Regional Director acted in <span style="font-weight: bold;">bad faith </span>and with <span style="font-weight: bold;">grave abuse of discretion,</span> petitioner is not entitled to backwages and consequently cannot claim for damages. In the case at bar, the record manifests that respondents officials were <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motivated</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ill</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personal</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">malice</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in dismissing</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioner</span> but only by their <span style="font-weight: bold;">desire to comply with the mandates of</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Presidential Decree No. 6</span>.

In <span style="font-style: italic;">Del Castillo</span>, the therein petitioner was preventively suspended and later dismissed for grave misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> He was eventually exonerated.  He was thus ordered reinstated.  He thereafter filed a "Motion for Clarificatory Relief" praying for an award of backwages.  Noting that the CSC did not object to the payment of backwages and the Solicitor General in fact recommended the payment thereof, this Court granted the motion.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Gabriel</span>, the therein petitioner was holding a permanent position of Motor Vehicle Registrar I at the Motor Vehicles Office, later renamed the Land Transportation Commission.  In 1979, the Land Transportation Commission was reorganized, renaming <span style="font-style: italic;">plantilla</span> positions. The therein petitioner's position was changed to Transportation District Supervisor, but since another had been appointed thereto, he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">protest.</span>  During the pendency of his protest, he was extended a casual appointment but his services were "in effect terminated" three days later, drawing him to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> file a complaint</span> for illegal termination of services which reached the CSC.  The CSC eventually found that the issuance to the therein petitioner of a casual appointment which resulted in the termination of his services was illegal and that he was more qualified than the one appointed to his renamed position of Transportation District Supervisor.
