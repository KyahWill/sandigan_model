Angeles, against her will.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellants, assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the crime charged when arraigned.<br><br><center><b>The Case for the Prosecution</b><br></center><br>At around 7:15 in the evening on January 13, 1996, Clarissa Angeles, a third-year student of St. Paul University, was with her boyfriend, William Ferrer. They were eating snacks inside a pick-up truck parked in a vacant lot near the Office of the Commission on Audit (COA) and the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) [now DepEd] in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, about fifteen meters from the highway. Momentarily, a tricycle passed by the truck on its way to the COA Building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Clarissa was seated on the passenger's side, while William was behind the wheel. The two were alarmed when they saw shadows of persons near the truck. Clarissa suggested to William that they leave. The latter opened the window on his side halfway to check if there were persons outside. Suddenly, a man, who turned out to be Rommel Macarubbo, appeared in front of the truck, pointed a gun at them and said: "This is a holdup. If you will start the engine of the car, I will shoot you." Thereafter, another man, who turned out to be Willy Suyu, lifted the lock on William's side and entered the pick-up. Clarissa told William to give everything so that they would not be harmed. Willy Suyu then took Ferrer's wallet which contained around P150.00. A third man, who turned out to be Francis Cainglet, took Clarissa's jewelry valued at around P2,500.00 and cash amounting to PI0.00. Thereafter, Willy Suyu clubbed William and dragged him out of the truck. Fortunately, William was able to escape and immediately went to the police station to report the incident.<br><br>Meanwhile, Willy Suyu lifted the lock of the pick-up truck at Clarissa's side. Macarubbo then opened the door. The two and Cainglet dragged the girl to a hilly place, not far away. Macarubbo and Willy Suyu held her by the arms, while Cainglet poked a fan knife at her. She pleaded for mercy as she was brought to a house near a muddy place. At that point, a man, who turned out to be Rodolfo Suyu, the half-brother of Willy Suyu, came out of the house. Willy Suyu, Cainglet and Macarubbo pushed Clarissa towards Rodolfo Suyu. The latter pushed Clarissa and said: "You stay there because I will be the first one." Rodolfo Suyu then started embracing and kissing Clarissa and fondling her breast. When Rodolfo Suyu removed her pants, the ring she kept hidden inside her pants fell to the ground. She felt a knife, flashlight and pliers at the perpetrator's back. Pretending that she was submitting to him, she suddenly reached for the knife. They briefly struggled and Clarissa kicked his groin. Cursing, Rodolfo Suyu loosened his grip on her. And she tried to run, but she stumbled and she was grabbed by the hair. He then punched her stomach twice. She pleaded to the three others for help, but the three did nothing.<br><br>Rodolfo Suyu passed Clarissa to Cainglet. Clarissa again pleaded, "Please do not hurt me, do not kill me and do not rape me. I am willing to join your group." She further begged, "Just give me the knife and I will be the one to kill myself." Cainglet kissed her but she pushed him away. He continued to kiss her and then pushed his tongue inside her mouth. She bit hard at his tongue, causing it to bleed down her shirt. She was cursed anew.<br><br>Then the three others came shouting, "They are coming." A beam of light illumined them. Cainglet and Rodolfo Suyu then brought her to the top of the hill near the Capitol. She attempted to shout but she feared for her life as a knife was thrust against her. She was forced to lie down on her back. Willy Suyu and Macarubbo served as lookouts, as Cainglet punched her on the thighs. Cainglet pinned her hands on the ground as Rodolfo Suyu removed her pants and undergarments. Rodolfo Suyu then spread her legs apart, removed his pants and undergarments, and went on top of her. Rodolfo Suyu then tried to insert his fully erected penis inside her vagina but the girl kicked him. He rolled down but was able to recover immediately. He resumed molesting her. Clarissa uttered, "It is better that you will just kill me and not rape me." Rodolfo Suyu insisted "<i>Ipitem (sic) met lang e</i>. Anyway, this is just for a few minutes." When he pushed his tongue inside her mouth, Clarissa bit it so hard that her teeth went through it. As the blood dripped on her shirt, he uttered, "I will let the blood drip on your shirt, mahirap na." Rodolfo Suyu inserted two fingers inside her. He then commented to Cainglet, who was still pinning her down, "Pare, this is still a virgin." Thereafter, with the aid of his two fingers, he inserted his penis inside her vagina.<br><br>Afterwards, Rodolfo Suyu told Cainglet, "You will be next." Cainglet then climbed on top of Clarissa while Rodolfo Suyu held her by the hands. She again pleaded for help from Willy Suyu and Macarubbo. But all her pleas fell on deaf ears. She kicked Cainglet, who then let go one of her hands. When one of her hands was briefly freed, she placed the crucifix pendant of her necklace on her mouth and uttered, "Lord, I offer you my soul." Rodolfo Suyu remarked, "We do not have God (<i>sic</i>), we do not believe in God." Cainglet continued to move on top of her. The two lookouts, Willy Suyu and Macarubbo, on the other hand, shouted, "They are coming." Rodolfo Suyu then helped her to sit down. Cainglet then spoke to her saying, "Put your pants. We will not give you your panty because we will have your panty be 'makulam' and tomorrow, we will display your panty on the gate of St. Paul with a dedication 'to Marie Sanchez'," the name she gave them. Cainglet was able to insert half an inch of his penis into her vagina.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Cainglet suggested that she be released for ransom. The two lookouts again yelled, "They are coming." Then a beam of light illumined them and engines from vehicles became audible. Thereafter, two vehicles arrived from about 10 to 15 meters away from the pick-up truck. After pleading for mercy and promising not to report them to the police authorities, she was allowed by the culprits to leave.<br><br>Clarissa fled to a house illumined with a fluorescent light and climbed over its gate. She went around the house and knocked on the door. An old man answered the door. Blood-stained and covered in mud, she then pleaded to be let in. At first, the old man got a piece of wood to club her, but because one of his children recognized her, she was allowed inside. Thereafter, the <i>barangay tanod</i> was summoned. After 15 minutes, two police jeeps arrived and took her to the Cagayan Valley Regional Hospital (CVRH). The nurses there, however, merely examined her bruises.<br><br>At the Don Domingo Police Station, Clarissa saw William. The authorities asked her if she had been sexually abused, she declared that there was merely an attempt to rape her. At that time, she was ashamed to admit in front of her boyfriend that she had been abused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On January 17, 1996, Clarissa submitted herself to a physical and gynecological examination at the CVRH. The examining physician, Dr. Elsie A. Pintucan, found hematoma and contusions, which she diagnosed to have been sustained five days before. Furthermore, she made the following findings:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Genitalia: external examination = abundant pubic hair, nulliparous outlet,<br>no bleeding note.<br>= hymen (+) complete, old healed laceration at 4 and 7 o'clock.<br>speculum = vaginal wall no erosions/laceration.<br>cervix = pinkish, (+) whitish discharge.<br><br>Internal examination = admits 1 finger with ease,<br>cervix = closed, small midline, firm, non-tender on wriggling,<br>uterus = small,<br>adnexae = negative for tenderness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>On January 19, 1996, Clarissa signed and filed a criminal complaint for robbery and rape against Rodolfo Suyu, Willy Suyu, Francis Cainglet and Rommel Bariuan (also known as Rommel Macarubbo) with the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Tuguegarao City. Appended to her complaint was her sworn statement executed on the same date. She later gave supplemental statements on January 25, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Accused Macarubbo, who was born on August 24, 1978, then, still a minor, moved to be released on recognizance. Upon the recommendation of the Department of Social Welfare and Services, he was  released on recognizance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Macarubbo, accompanied by an old woman, arrived at Clarissa's boarding house. The woman offered that her son, Macarubbo, would testify for her case. Clarissa was amenable to the idea because the authorities had earlier advised her to agree to Macarubbo being a state witness. The old woman pleaded that Clarissa pity Macarubbo, who then worked as a part-time newspaper vendor to help his parents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Moreover, Macarubbo did not rape her.<br><br>On April 2, 1996, Macarubbo, assisted by his counsel Atty. Gabriel O. Valle and his mother, Angelina, signed a sworn statement, in the form of questions and answers before Municipal Judge Elpidio Atal. He confessed to his participation and implicated Rodolfo and Willy Suyu, and Cainglet, in the robbery and the rape of Clarissa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]<br><br></sup><center><b>The Case for the Accused</b><br></center><br>Rodolfo Suyu denied the charge against him. He also interposed the defense of alibi. He declared that, on January 13, 1996, he was in their house at Alimannao, Tuguegarao City, taking care of his three young children, the youngest of whom was five months old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> His wife was in Manila with her sister-in-law who had just given birth. He never left their house in the evening.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>At 3:00 p.m. on January 16, 1996, he left his house and gathered cogon at the Bassig Resort, which was about a kilometer away. He was shot on the left thigh, but he did not know who shot him; neither did he bother to ascertain the identity of the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He managed to escape and arrived home at 7:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> His wound was treated by his neighbor and eldest child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> While away, his 9-year-old eldest child took care of his five-month-old baby. He did not report the shooting incident to the police.<br><br>On January 18, 1996, policemen led by SPO4 Teodulfo Cudal arrested him and brought him to the hospital where his wound was treated. He was later brought to the Sto. Domingo Police Substation where he was detained. He was told to join a police line-up. SPO4 Cudal told Clarissa to point to him as one of the culprits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Cainglet declared that he was employed as a security guard inspector by the Night Hawk Security Investigation Agency with principal office in Quezon City. At about 7:15 p.m. on January 13, 1996, he was in the company of Nestor, an employee of the security agency, conducting a roving inspection at the Corinthian*Gardens. At 8:00 p.m. on January 21, 1996, he boarded a Victory Liner passenger bus and arrived in Tuguegarao City at 7:30 a.m. the next day, January 22, 1996. He intended to seek financial help from his mother since his wife needed money for her placement fee. A neighbor told him that his mother had left for Mindanao. He opened the door of the house with a duplicate key. After lunch, 12 armed men, led by SPO4 Cudal, barged inside and searched the house without any warrant. The armed men took his wedding ring and that of his wife, his wallet with cash of P2,150.10, and his Seiko watch. The personal properties taken from him were worth P10,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>He was tortured, hogtied with a nylon cord, and boarded in an owner-type jeep with only his underwear on. He was brought to the police headquarters for investigation for robbery with rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> When the policemen failed to secure a confession from him, SPO4 Cudal took out a knife from his table. He was ordered to bring out his tongue and when he did, another policeman held out his tongue while SPO4 Cudal pointed the knife to his tongue. When he turned his face to the left, his tongue was injured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He was brought to the CVRH where he saw Rodolfo Suyu. When SPO4 Cudal told Rodolfo Suyu that Cainglet was one of his companions, Rodolfo Suyu told SPO4 Cudal that he did not know him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>At 7:30 a.m. the next day, he was ordered to join a line-up, including two persons he knew only while in detention, namely, Rodolfo Suyu and Rommel Macarubbo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Clarissa arrived and was ordered by SPO4 Cudal to point to him as one of those who raped her. She failed to point at him at first, but when ordered anew by SPO4 Cudal, she finally pointed to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She also pointed to Rodolfo Suyu and Rommel Macarubbo. From the time Cainglet was arrested and while detained, he had no counsel.<br><br>Macarubbo testified that he was born on August 24, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> He denied knowing any of his co-accused before his arrest on January 17, 1996. He declared that he was a native of Cagayan, Tuguegarao City, and went to San Pablo, Isabela on January 12, 1996 to visit his aunt Emma Pagulayan. He arrived in San Pablo at 7:00 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On January 17, 1996, he visited his friend Joel Iringan in San Pablo for a drinking spree. One of the guests created trouble and shot him on his right leg.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He was brought to Tumauini District Hospital but was transferred to the CVRH in Tuguegarao City. The next day, the policemen, led by Capt. Salvador,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> maltreated him. He was forced to confess to the crime in Carig.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> After his wounds were treated at the hospital, he was brought to the police station where he was detained. He never left San Pablo from January 12, 1996 until his arrest on January 17, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Willy Suyu testified that on the day of the alleged robbery and rape, he was in their house at Dodan, Penablanca, Cagayan, about 45 minutes by tricycle from Centro, Tuguegarao, Cagayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> At 6:00 a.m., he and his wife went on foot to a place called Hot Spring to gather firewood. They arrived at the place at around 11:00 a.m., had their lunch at the house of his wife's niece, Lanie Tuliao, gathered firewood, then proceeded back home to Dodan. By 6:00 p.m., they were already at their house. They had their dinner at 8:00 p.m. Before going to bed, their neighbor, James Taccad, invited him for a bottle of beer. He went back home at around 8:20 p.m., and went to bed with his wife at 9:00 p.m. He worked as a tricycle driver, but he did not go out the following day, as the piston ring of the tricycle he was driving was broken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>James Taccad, Willy's neighbor, and Eduardo Dalin, Willy's brother-in-law, were presented to corroborate Willy's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Willy Suyu further testified that on February 12, 1996, he was arrested and detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> At the police station in Tuguegarao City where he was brought, he was maltreated by policemen. After 3 or 4 days in detention, Clarissa, whom he met for the first time, went to the station and asked for the person named Willy Suyu. The other detainees pointed to him and Clarissa said, "So you are the person named Willy Suyu." She asked him to show his tongue. He did so and Clarissa said, within the hearing distance of the other detainees, that he was not the one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Willy, moreover, admitted that Rodolfo Suyu was his half-brother. He, however, denied having known Macarubbo and Cainglet prior to his detention as he met them only in jail. He also saw Clarissa, for the first time, at the police station when she asked for him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Rodolfo Suyu used to stay at their father's house in Capitol Hills (near the place where the robbery and rape happened), but stayed at Barangay Gosi, Tuguegarao, most of the time where he helped in the farming.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Accused Rodolfo Suyu and Macarubbo presented SPO4 Cudal as their witness. The police officer testified that, as gleaned from the police blotter, at 9:30 p.m. on January 13, 1996, Clarissa failed to identify the culprits and to declare that she was raped. However, she insisted that in the event that she saw the culprits again, she can identify them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Cainglet was a mere caretaker of the house where he was arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It was the owner of the house who informed the police officers that he was hiding in the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> He noticed a bite mark on the tongue of Cainglet when he viewed it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, SPO4 Cudal declared that Macarubbo, assisted by his counsel, executed an extrajudicial statement on April 2, 1996, in the presence of his mother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>SPO1 Alexander Tamang, the investigator assigned at the Domingo Police Substation on the evening of January 13, 1996, was presented by Willy's counsel and testified, among others, that the blotter, as written, did not state the name of the malefactors, their features or characteristics, or the unlawful taking of personal property; and that the blotter did not state a sexual abuse but only that Clarissa bit the tongue of one of the suspects and kicked the sex organ of the other accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> He, however, added that he did not write the word rape because what he understood from Clarissa's statement was the biting of the tongue and the kicking of the sex organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The prosecution presented SPO4 Cudal as rebuttal witness and testified that accused Macarubbo gave an extrajudicial confession on April 2, 1998 while detained at the jail, and that he signed his extrajudicial confession before Judge Atal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The prosecution wanted to present Atty. Gabriel Valle as rebuttal witness because the judge was already dead; but, after an off-the-record conference between the court, the counsel of the accused and the prosecution, the plan of the prosecution did not materialize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The court admitted the extrajudicial confession of Macarubbo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> only as part of the testimony of SPO4 Cudal because, according to the court, the prosecution failed to present Judge Atal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On February 10, 2003, the RTC rendered judgment finding all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of robbery with rape. The RTC gave credence and probative weight to Clarissa's testimony and rejected the defenses of denial and alibi of the accused. The court ruled that the latter's testimonies were full of inconsistencies and were not in accord with human experience. The RTC further ruled that the four accused conspired in the robbery with rape. The dispositive portion of the said decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>(1) Finding RODOLFO SUYU, WILLY SUYU, FRANCIS CAINGLET and ROMMEL MACARRUBO, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Rape and hereby sentence each of them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>;<br><br>(2) Ordering the accused to pay, jointly and severally, the amount of PI,510.00 representing the value of the jewelry (earring) and cash belonging to Clarissa Angeles; and<br><br>(3) Ordering the accused to indemnify, jointly and severally, Clarissa Angeles the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>The accused appealed the decision to the Court. After the parties submitted their respective briefs, the Court ordered the transfer of the case to the CA pursuant to its ruling in <i>People v. Mateo</i>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The CA rendered judgment affirming, with modification, the decision of the trial court. The <i>fallo</i> of the decision of the CA reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the decision dated 10 February 2003 of the court <i>a quo</i> is perforce <b>AFFIRMED</b> but with the <b>modification</b> that insofar as the accused-appellant ROMMEL MACARUBBO is concerned, he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from Eight (8) years and One (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, in its medium period, as minimum, to Fifteen (15) years of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, in its medium period, as maximum.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the present petition, where the appellants raise the following arguments:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT CLARISSA ANGELES.<br><center><br>II<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED.<br><center><br>III<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT DECLARING AS INADMISSIBLE THE ALLEGED EXTRAJUDICIAL CONFESSION OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT ROMMEL MACARUBBO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellants assert that Clarissa was not able to identify any of them at the city jail and succeeded in identifying them only after she was coached by SPO4 Cudal. They contend that Clarissa was declared by Dr. Pintucan to be ambulatory and coherent with no signs of cardio-respiratory distress, proof that she was not forcibly and sexually assaulted. It was also discovered that there was no evidence of forcible assault despite the insertion of one finger on her cervix.   Appellants argue that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence the extrajudicial confession of appellant Macarubbo.<br><br>Appellants, moreover, aver that the testimony of Clarissa is postmarked with inconsistencies. She executed no less than five sworn statements before the MTC. These statements were substantially inconsistent. In her January 13, 1996 statement made immediately after the alleged commission of the crime, she declared to the police investigator that appellants attempted to rape her, but she actually succeeded in thwarting all attempts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In her second sworn statement dated January 18, 1996, she maintained the said story. The police blotter did not even carry an allegation of rape.

Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise, the objection is deemed waived. Even in the instances not allowed by law, a warrantless arrest is not a jurisdictional defect, and objection thereto is waived where the person arrested submits to arraignment without objection. The subsequent filing of the charges and the issuance of the corresponding warrant of arrest against a person illegally detained will cure the defect of that detention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellants also assert that the medical report issued by Dr. Pintucan does not conclusively suggest that Clarissa was raped, for during the examination, her deportment was not of that of a rape victim and the examination of her cervix did not even suggest forcible assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The said argument is, however, without merit. Hymenal lacerations which are usually inflicted when there is complete penetration are not essential in establishing the crime of rape as it is enough that a slight penetration or entry of the penis into the lips of the vagina takes place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Partial penile penetration is as serious as full penetration; the rape is deemed consummated in either case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Dr. Pintucan further found contusion and hematoma on the victim, which bolsters Clarissa's recount that she was dragged, forced to lie down, and raped.<br><br>The common defense of alibi used by the appellants cannot, moreover, prevail over Clarissa's clear and convincing narration of the events that transpired and her positive identification of her assailants.

The records show that the distance from Willy Suyu's house to Capitol Hills can be negotiated in 15 minutes by tricycle; hence, it was not impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime.<br><br>Macarubbo testified that he left Tuguegarao City on January 13, 1996; and arrived in the house of his aunt, Emma Pagulayan and worked in her farm; he was shot at the thigh on January 17, 1996. However, appellant Macarubbo  failed  to present his  aunt and his friend, Joel Iringan, to corroborate his alibi. Moreover, it is incredible that Macarubbo did not even know who shot him despite his claim that the perpetrator was known to his friend, Iringan. Rodolfo Suyu's claim that he was in his house in Alimannao, Tuguegarao City on the night in question is equally weak, for he failed to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be near the DECS (now DepEd) and COA buildings in the city.<br><br>For his part, appellant Cainglet failed to present any record from the Night Hawk Security Agency to prove that on January 13, 1996, at 7:15 p.m., he was conducting a roving inspection at the Corinthian Gardens in Quezon City, as he claimed; neither did he present the driver of his employer who was purportedly with him at the time.<br><br>After going over the voluminous records, We find no error in the aforesaid observations of the trial court as affirmed by the CA.

Indeed, "at the time of the commission of the crime, accused acted in concert, each doing his part to fulfill their common design to rob the victim and although only two of them, through force and intimidation, raped Clarissa, the failure of Macarubbo and Willy Suyu to prevent its commission although they were capable would make their act to be the act of all."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> We have previously ruled that once conspiracy is established between several accused in the commission of the crime of robbery, they would all be equally culpable for the rape committed by any of them on the occasion of the robbery, unless any of them proves that he endeavored to prevent the other from committing rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>The conviction thus of appellants for robbery with rape defined and penalized under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code is correct. The law provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 294. <i>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons</i> - <i>Penalties</i>. - Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><ol><li>The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.<br></li></ol></blockquote>To be convicted of robbery with rape, the following elements must concur: (1) the taking of personal property is committed with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is characterized by intent to gain or animus lucrandi; (4) the robbery is accompanied by rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The intent to rob must precede the rape. In robbery with rape, the intention of the felony is to rob and the felony is accompanied by rape. The rape must be contemporaneous with the commission of the robbery. We note that aside from raping the victim, appellant Rodolfo Suyu inserted his finger in her sexual organ. Appellant Suyu, thus, committed sexual assault as defined and penalized in Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of Republic Act No. 8353.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Also, aside from Rodolfo Suyu, Cainglet raped the victim.
