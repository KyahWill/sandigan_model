				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A writ of preliminary injunction is issued to prevent an extrajudicial foreclosure, only upon a clear showing of a violation of the mortgagor's unmistakable right.

As security for this credit facility, petitioners executed real estate mortgages over several parcels of land located in the cities of Muntinlupa, Las Pi√±as, Antipolo and Quezon; and over several condominium units in Makati.  Petitioners were likewise required to execute a promissory note in favor of respondent every time they availed of the credit facility.  As required in these notes, they paid the interest in monthly amortizations.<br><br>The parties stipulated in their Credit Agreement dated September 19, 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> that failure to pay "any availment of the accommodation or interest, or any sum due" shall constitute an event of default,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which shall consequently allow respondent bank to "declare [as immediately due and payable] all outstanding availments of the accommodation together with accrued interest and any other sum payable." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In need of further business capital, petitioners obtained from UCPB an increase in their credit facility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  For this purpose, they executed a Promissory Note for P103,909,710.82, which was to mature on March 26, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  In the same note, they agreed to an interest rate of 21.75 percent per annum, payable by monthly amortizations.<br><br>On December 21, 1998, respondent sent petitioners a demand letter, worded as follows:<br><blockquote>"Gentlemen:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"With reference to your loan with principal outstanding balance of [P103,909,710.82], it appears from the records of United Coconut Planters Bank that you failed to pay interest amortizations amounting to [P14,959,525.10] on the Promissory Note on its due date, 30 May 1998.<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">"x x x                             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Accordingly, formal demand is hereby made upon you to pay your outstanding obligations in the total amount of P14,959,525.10, which includes unpaid interest and penalties as of 21 December 1998 due on the promissory note, eight (8) days from date hereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Respondent decided to invoke the acceleration provision in their Credit Agreement.

All subsequent proceedings in the trial court and in the CA involved only the propriety of issuing a TRO and a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Judge Josefina G. Salonga,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> then executive judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, denied the Urgent Ex-parte Motion for Immediate Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), filed by petitioners.  Judge Salonga denied their motion on the ground that no great or irreparable injury would be inflicted on them if the parties would first be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  Unsatisfied, petitioners filed an Ex-Parte Motion for Reconsideration, by reason of which the case was eventually raffled to Branch 148, presided by Judge Oscar B.

Accordingly, in an Order dated September 6, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Judge Pimentel denied petitioners' application for a TRO for having been rendered moot by respondent's Manifestation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, respondent filed new applications for foreclosure in the cities where the mortgaged properties were located.  Undaunted, petitioners filed another Motion for the Issuance of a TRO/Injunction and a Supplementary Motion for the Issuance of TRO/Injunction with Motion to Clarify Order of September 6, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On October 27, 1999, Judge Pimentel issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> granting a 20-day TRO in favor of petitioners.

The Order states:<br><blockquote>"Admitted by defendant witness is the fact that in all the notices of foreclosure sale of the properties of the plaintiffs x x x it is stated in each notice that the property will be sold at public auction to satisfy the mortgage indebtedness of plaintiffs which as of August 31, 1999 amounts to P131,854,773.98.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                             x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                       x x x<br></div><br>"As the court sees it, this is the problem that should be addressed by the defendant in this case and in the meantime, the notice of foreclosure sale should be held in abeyance until such time as these matters are clarified and cleared by the defendants x x x Should the defendant be able to remedy the situation this court will have no more alternative but to allow the defendant to proceed to its intended action.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                             x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                       x x x<br></div><br>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, and finding compelling reason at this point in time to grant the application for preliminary injunction, the same is hereby granted upon posting of a preliminary injunction bond in the amount of P3,500,000.00 duly approved by the court, let a writ of preliminary injunction be issued."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The corresponding Writ of Preliminary Injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> was issued on November 29, 1999.<br><br>Respondent moved for reconsideration.  On the other hand, petitioners filed a Motion to Clarify Order of November 26, 1999. Conceding that the November 26 Order had granted an injunction during the pendency of the case, respondent contended that the injunctive writ merely restrained it for a period of 20 (twenty) days.<br><br>On December 29, 2000, Judge Pimentel issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> granting respondent's Motion for Reconsideration and clarifying his November 26, 1999 Order in this manner:<br><blockquote>"There may have been an error in the Writ of Preliminary Injunction issued dated November 29, 1999 as the same [appeared to be actually] an extension of the TRO issued by this Court dated 27 October 1999 for another 20 days period.

On March 15, 2002, Judge Dumayas granted petitioners' Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and Specification of the Foreclosure Proceeds, as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion to Reconsider the Order dated December 29, 2000 is hereby granted and the Order of November 26, 1999 granting the preliminary injunction is reinstated subject however to the condition that all properties of plaintiffs which were extrajudicially foreclosed though public bidding are subject to an accounting.

It held that petitioners had a clear right to an injunction, based on the fact that respondent had kept them in the dark as to how and why their principal obligation had ballooned to almost P132 million. The CA held that respondent's refusal to give them a detailed accounting had prevented the determination of the maturity of the obligation and precluded the possibility of a foreclosure of the mortgaged properties.  Moreover, their payment of P10 million had the effect of updating, and thereby averting the maturity of, the outstanding obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was granted by a Special Division of Five of the Former Special Fifteenth Division.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Citing <span style="font-style: italic;">China Banking Corporation v.

Thus, he concluded that a request for accounting -- for the purpose of determining whether the proceeds of the auction would suffice to cover the indebtedness -- would not justify an injunction on the foreclosure.<br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated May 31, 2004, which the appellate court denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioners raise the following issues for our consideration:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>"Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals denied the petitioners of due process.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>"Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals supported its Amended Decision by invoking jurisprudence not applicable and completely identical with the instant case.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III<br></div><br>"Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals failed to establish its finding that RTC Judge Winlove Dumayas has acted with grave abuse of discretion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>The resolution of this case hinges on two issues: 1) whether petitioners are in default; and 2) whether there is basis for preliminarily enjoining the extrajudicial foreclosure.

Nevertheless, it maintains that it has furnished them a detailed monthly statement of account.<br><br>A debt is liquidated when the amount is known or is determinable by inspection of the terms and conditions of the relevant promissory notes and related documentation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Failure to furnish a debtor a detailed statement of account does not ipso facto result in an unliquidated obligation.<br><br>Petitioners executed a Promissory Note, in which they stated that their principal obligation was in the amount of P103,909,710.82, subject to an interest rate of 21.75 percent per annum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>  Pursuant to the parties' Credit Agreement, petitioners likewise know that any delay in the payment of the principal obligation will subject them to a penalty charge of one percent per month, computed from the due date until the obligation is paid in full.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>It is in fact clear from the agreement of the parties that when the payment is accelerated due to an event of default, the penalty charge shall be based on the total principal amount outstanding, to be computed from the date of acceleration until the obligation is paid in full.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  Their Credit Agreement even provides for the application of payments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>  It appears from the agreements that the amount of total obligation is known or, at the very least, determinable.<br><br>Moreover, when they made their partial payment, petitioners did not question the principal, interest or penalties demanded from them.  They only sought additional time to update their interest payments or to negotiate a possible restructuring of their account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>  Hence, there is no basis for their allegation that a statement of account was necessary for them <span style="font-style: italic;">to know</span> their obligation.  We cannot impair respondent's right to foreclose the properties on the basis of their unsubstantiated allegation of a violation of due process.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Spouses  Estares v. CA</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> we did not find any justification to grant a preliminary injunction, even when the mortgagors were disputing the amount being sought from them. We held in that case that "[u]pon the nonpayment of the loan, which was secured by the mortgage, the mortgaged property is properly subject to a foreclosure sale."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Compared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Estares</span>, the denial of injunctive relief in this case is even more imperative, because the present petitioners do not even assail the amounts due from them.  Neither do they contend that a detailed accounting would show that they are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> in default.  A pending question regarding the due amount was not a sufficient reason to enjoin the foreclosure in <span style="font-style: italic;">Estares</span>.  Hence, with more reason should injunction be denied in the instant case, in which there is no dispute as to the outstanding obligation of petitioners.<br><br>At any rate, whether respondent furnished them a detailed statement of account is a question of fact that this Court need not and will not resolve in this instance.  As held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Zulueta v. Reyes</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> in which there was no genuine controversy as to the amounts due and demandable, the foreclosure should not be restrained by the unnecessary question of accounting.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Maturity of the Loan Not <br>Averted by Partial Compliance <br>with Respondent's Demand</span><br><br>Petitioners allege that their partial payment of P10 million on March 25, 1999, had the effect of <span style="font-style: italic;">forestalling</span> the maturity of the loan;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> hence the foreclosure proceedings are premature. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>  We disagree.<br><br>To be sure, their partial payment did not extinguish the obligation.  The Civil Code states that a debt is not paid "unless the thing x x x in which the obligation consists has been <span style="font-style: italic;">completely</span> delivered x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>  Besides, a late partial payment could not have possibly <span style="font-style: italic;">forestalled a long-expired maturity date</span>.<br><br>The only possible legal relevance of the partial payment was to evidence the mortgagee's amenability to granting the mortgagor a grace period.  Because the partial payment would constitute a waiver of the mortgagee's vested right to foreclose, the grant of a grace period cannot be casually assumed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>  the bank's agreement must be clearly shown.  Without a doubt, no express agreement was entered into by the parties.  Petitioners only <span style="font-style: italic;">assumed</span> that their partial payment had satisfied respondent's demand and obtained for them more time to update their account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Petitioners are mistaken.  When creditors receive partial payment, they are not ipso facto deemed to have abandoned their prior demand for full payment.  Article 1235 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>"When the obligee accepts the performance, knowing its incompleteness or irregularity, and <span style="font-style: italic;">without expressing any protest or objection</span>, the obligation is deemed fully complied with."<br></blockquote>Thus, to <span style="font-style: italic;">imply</span> that creditors accept partial payment as complete performance of their obligation, their acceptance must be made under circumstances that indicate their <span style="font-style: italic;">intention</span> to consider the performance complete and to renounce their claim arising from the defect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>There are no circumstances that would indicate a renunciation of the right of respondent to foreclose the mortgaged properties extrajudicially, on the basis of petitioners' continuing default.  On the contrary, it <span style="font-style: italic;">asserted</span> its right by filing an application for extrajudicial foreclosure after receiving the partial payment.  Clearly, it did not intend to give petitioners more time to meet their obligation.<br><br>Parenthetically, respondent cannot be reproved for accepting their partial payment.  While Article 1248 of the Civil Code states that creditors cannot be compelled to accept partial payments, it does not prohibit them from accepting such payments.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Enjoining the Extrajudicial Foreclosure</span><br></div><br>A writ of preliminary injunction is a provisional remedy that may be resorted to by litigants, only to protect or preserve their rights or interests during the pendency of the principal action. To authorize a temporary injunction, the plaintiff must show, at least prima facie, a right to the final relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  Moreover, it must show that the invasion of the right sought to be protected is material and substantial, and that there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In the absence of a clear legal right, the issuance of the injunctive writ constitutes grave abuse of discretion.  Injunction is not designed to protect contingent or future rights.  It is not proper when the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, courts should avoid issuing this writ, which in effect disposes of the main case without trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Manila International Airport Authority v. CA</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> we urged courts to exercise caution in issuing the writ, as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x.  We remind trial courts that while generally the grant of a writ of preliminary injunction rests on the sound discretion of the court taking cognizance of the case, <span style="font-style: italic;">extreme caution must be observed in the exercise of such discretion</span>. The discretion of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> to grant an injunctive writ must be exercised based on the grounds and in the manner provided by law. Thus, the Court declared in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Garcia v. Burgos</span>:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"It has been consistently held that there is no power the exercise of which is more delicate, which requires greater caution, deliberation and sound discretion, or more dangerous in a doubtful case, than the issuance of an injunction. It is the strong arm of equity that should never be extended unless to cases of great injury, where courts of law cannot afford an adequate or commensurate remedy in damages.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Every court should remember that an injunction is a limitation upon the freedom of action of the defendant and should not be granted lightly or precipitately. <span style="font-style: italic;">It should be granted only when the court is fully satisfied that the law permits it and the emergency demands it</span>.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  (Citations omitted)</div></blockquote></blockquote></div>Petitioners do not have any clear right to be protected.  As shown in our earlier findings, they failed to substantiate their allegations that their right to due process had been violated and the maturity of their obligation forestalled.  Since they indisputably failed to meet their obligations in spite of repeated demands, we hold that there is no legal justification to enjoin respondent from enforcing its undeniable right to foreclose the mortgaged properties.<br><br>In any case, petitioners will not be deprived outrightly of their property.  Pursuant to Section 47 of the General Banking Law of 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> mortgagors who have judicially or extrajudicially sold their real property for the full or partial payment of their obligation have the right to redeem the property within one year after the sale.  They can redeem their real estate by paying the amount due, with interest rate specified, under the mortgage deed; as well as all the costs and expenses incurred by the bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Moreover, in extrajudicial foreclosures, petitioners have the right to receive any surplus in the selling price.  This right was recognized in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sulit v. CA</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> in which the Court held that "if the mortgagee is retaining more of the proceeds of the sale than he is entitled to, this fact alone will not affect the validity of the sale but simply gives the mortgagor a cause of action to recover such surplus."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Petitioners failed to demonstrate the prejudice they would probably suffer by reason of the foreclosure.
