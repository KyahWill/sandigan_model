He occupied the backseat (passenger's seat), between Biong and one Jun Alcantara<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> who "used to while away his time at the warrant section" of the Parañaque Police Station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  The driver's seat was occupied by one Capt. Tible of the Air Force.  He was acquainted with the three as he "used to accompany them in all their <span style="font-style: italic;">"lakad" </span>because [he, Cayubit] was an asset."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>With Tible, whose first name Cayubit does not know, on the wheels, the jeep headed west and as it approached the Coastal Road, Biong forced Cayubit to strip off his clothes including his underwear, and he did.  And then Biong handcuffed his hands "at the back."<br><br>Somewhere along the Coastal Road "near the bridge," Biong freed Cayubit's hands, asked him to alight, "brought him at the side and when [he] was lying down, [Biong] just pulled out his gun and when he was about to shoot [him]," Tible and Alcantara restrained Biong, Tible saying that <span style="font-style: italic;">"Wala sa usapan natin iyan, pare."</span>  Biong thereupon kicked Cayubit and asked him to board the jeep. <br><br>With Tible still on the wheels, the group repaired to D&L Disco Pub located at Lopez corner Sucat, Parañaque.  While there, Biong "wrapped [Cayubit's] head with a jacket" which Cayubit was, however, able to remove, thus enabling him to see Biong approach and talk to five persons "[a]t the door" of the pub.  The five persons including one whom Biong tapped at the buttocks thereafter left on board two vehicles as Biong partook of <span style="font-style: italic;">balut</span>.   Biong not long after returned to the jeep, "cleaned his hands he used in eating bal[u]t on [Cayubit's] head," and again covered Cayubit's head with a jacket.  The group thereupon repaired to and arrived at B.F. Homes Subdivision in Parañaque at about 3:30 a.m. of June 30, 1991.<br><br>While at the subdivision, Biong ordered Cayubit to alight.  Followed by Tible and Alcantara, the four of them proceeded to an unlit house.  Before reaching the house, they met three of the five persons Biong earlier met, including the one whose buttocks Biong tapped, who told Biong <span style="font-style: italic;">"Iyan ba, i-salvage na yan, tapusin na kaagad iyan."</span><br><br>As the group approached the door of the house, <span style="font-style: italic;">"may lumabas pong puro dugo na parang naka-security guard pong uniform pang-ibaba at civilian pang-itaas, uniform na puro dugo."</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Biong entered the house and then came out and asked Cayubit to spray the rooms with tear gas.  On entering one room, Cayubit saw dead bodies of three women, one of whom was naked with her hands tied at her back.  Biong then asked Cayubit to pick up a blood-stained <span style="font-style: italic;">bayoneta </span>and as Cayubit was in the act of picking it up, Biong attempted to shoot him but again he was restrained by Tible and Alcantara. <br><br>Biong and Alcantara thereafter conversed outside the house in the course of which Cayubit fled, he running until he reached Lopez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>In Lopez, Cayubit saw the same jeep he had earlier boarded, bearing only Tible and Alcantara.  Seeing that Biong was not in the jeep, Cayubit motioned to stop it as it did and he boarded it.   Tible and Alcantara brought him home but before reaching his house, he asked them why Biong wanted to shoot him, but the two proffesed no knowledge about it.  They nevertheless warned him to just keep silent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>While at the penitentiary, Cayubit, through a reporter, contacted his lawyer friend Atty. Macario Angarao who went to see him.  He requested Atty. Angarao to help him for "[he] is <span style="font-style: italic;">agrabiado </span>considering that [his] kakampi Capt. Tible and Alcantara are already dead." Hence, his execution of the September 7, 1995 affidavit which led to the filing of the present information against Biong.<br><br>Cayubit's <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinumpaang Salaysay</span> was marked in evidence.<br><br>Denying the accusation, Biong gave the following version:  He was, from the evening of June 29, 1991 up to the morning of June 30, 1991, on duty at the Investigation Division of the Parañaque Police Headquarters, his tour of duty being from 7:00 P.M. up to 7:00 A.M. the following day. <br><br>At around 4:00 o'clock in the morning of June 30, 1991, on returning to the headquarters after responding to a taxi driver's complaint against persons who boarded his vehicle but who did not pay their fare, he was directed by the desk officer to proceed to 80 Vinzon St., B.F. Homes, Parañaque and conduct, as he did, an investigation in connection with the Visconde massacre that occurred in said place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <br><br>Biong was himself later investigated by the Inspector General of the Philippine National Police (IG PNP), both in Bicutan and in Crame, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the National Police Commission, and was suspended for 60 days for failure to preserve the evidence in the Vizconde massacre.  And he was eventually summarily dismissed from the service. <br><br>On June 23, 1995, Biong was arrested and detained, he having been referred to by a prosecution witness, Jessica Alfaro, in the Vizconde massacre case as a driver-bodyguard of the Webbs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  He was being lured to become a state witness by offering him material things and promotion in his career.  He denied having been a driver-bodyguard of the Webbs, however.  And he refused to be a state witness which earned the ire of the NBI, hence, he was falsely indicted for the present charge.<br><br>Biong does not know Tible and Alcantara.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As for Cayubit, the first time he met him was when he was brought to jail in relation to another case, and a relative of Cayubit who happened to come from his (Biong's) hometown asked him to protect Cayubit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <br><br>SPO1 Fidel Alhambra, a desk officer of the Parañaque police, corroborated Biong's testimony of being directed to go to the scene of, and investigate the Vizconde massacre after he (Alhambra) received a message from a radio operator of the Parañaque Police Station regarding said incident. <br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of February 24, 1997, Branch 258 of the Parañaque RTC convicted Biong of attempted murder with the "aggravating" [sic] circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the prosecution having been able to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, accused GERARDO BIONG is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of PRISION CORRECCIONAL as minimum to nine (9) years, six (6) months and twenty (20) days of PRISION MAYOR as maximum and to pay the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>In so deciding, the trial court found that Cayubit's testimony was "clear, convincing, categorical, consistent and frank," and that his "affirmative testimony is much stronger" than Biong's  denial-negative testimony.  Thus it observed:<br><blockquote>Culled from  the private complainant vis-à-vis that of the accused and his witness, the Court after a careful evaluation and analysis of the parties assertions and averments is of the honest opinion and belief and so holds that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of attempted murder as charged in the Information.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In this case, the testimony of the private complainant was made in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">clear, convincing, categorical, consistent and frank manner.</span> He <span style="font-weight: bold;">positively identified the accused</span> as the one who twice made an attempt on his life by trying to shoot him, first near the bridge at the coastal road and the second inside the house at BF Homes but twice it was foiled by the timely intervention of Capt. Tible.  While the private complainant does not know why the accused wanted to kill him, motive need no longer be proven as the accused was positively identified (People v. Paragua, 326 Phil. 923 (1996)<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Taken all together, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the defense of the accused regarding the charge against him is that of <span style="font-weight: bold;">denial</span>.</span>  That he does not know the accused except when he was jailed sometime in 1988 and even extended him a favor while detained.  Well-settled is the rule that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">denial, like alibi is</span> very easy to concoct but hard to prove.</span>  Moreover, <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">denial is a self-serving negative defense that cannot be given greater w[ei]ght than the declaration of a credible witness who testified on affirmative matters</span> (People v. Salison, Jr., 253 SCRA 768). Furthermore, an <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">affirmative testimony is much stronger than a negative testimony</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hence, a mere denial is insufficient.</span>  There should be corroboration.  In this, the defense failed as the testimony of SPO1 Alhambra did not in any way help the accused but instead destroyed his credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In fine, the trial court found Cayubit to be a credible witness and his testimony credible. <br><br>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Biong ascribed to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">A<br></div><br>. . . IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF LONE PROSECUTION WITNESS EVEN IF THE TESTIMONY IS <span style="text-decoration: underline;">RIDDLED WITH MATERIAL INCONSISTENCIES AND SUBSTANTIAL CONTRADICTIONS.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">B<br></div><br>. . . IN HOLDING [THAT] THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROSECUTION'S LONE WITNESS, BEING AN <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AFFIRMATIVE TESTIMONY, IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE APPELLANT'S NEGATIVE TESTIMONY.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">C<br></div><br>. . . IN CONVICTING THE APPELLANT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABSENCE OF PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals found all assigned errors bereft of merit. <br><br>The appellate court found that no inconsistencies are extant from the evidence on record.<br><br>On Cayubit's credibility, the appellate court recalled the repeated ruling of this Court that the "trial court's findings with respect thereto are generally not disturbed on appeal." <br><br>On Biong's claim that his refusal to turn state witness in the Vizconde case earned the ire of the NBI, the appellate court branded it as a bare accusation, and finding no showing of improper motive on the part of Cayubit, it held that his testimony "is worthy of full faith and credence."  Thus it held:<br><blockquote>Said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bare accusation</span>, however, was not substantiated.  It is worth noting that private complainant himself refused to testify in the said Vizconde case.  Moreover, it escapes Us why private complainant will file the present case against the accused-appellant just because the latter refused to turn state witness in the Vizconde case.  Hence, since there is no evidence to show any improper motive on the part of complaining witness Cayubit to testify against the accused or to falsely implicate him in the commission of the case, the logical conclusion is that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">testimony is worthy of full faith and credence</span>.  (People vs. Malabago, 271 SCRA 464) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of March 11, 1999, the appellate court thus affirmed that of the trial court. <br><br>His Motion for Reconsideration having been denied, Biong filed the present Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> faulting the appellate court as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>. . . IN NOT HOLDING THAT <span style="text-decoration: underline;">UNDER THE FACTS OF THE CASE PETITIONER COULD ONLY BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE CRIME OF LIGHT THREATS.</span></li><br><li>. . .

The same does not hold true, however, with respect to credibility of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">testimony</span>.<br><br>In assailing Cayubit's testimony, Biong proffers:<br><blockquote>[T]he private complainant testified that after the petitioner attempted to kill him at a bridge along Coastal road, the petitioner met with five persons at D&L Disco Pub.  Then the petitioner wrapped the private complainant's head with a jacket.  Thereafter, the petitioner, ever intent on eating his <span style="font-style: italic;">balut</span>, did not pay any more attention on the private complainant — not even when the private complainant removed the jacket that the petitioner wrapped around his head.  If these were true, and if it were true that Tible and Alcantara were on the private complainant's side, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the private complainant could have easily escaped at that time.  But he did not.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The private complainant's testimony to the effect that he considered Tible and Alcantara to be his "kakampi" presumably because they rescued him from the clutches of death at the hands of the petitioner is equally incredible and contrary to reason and human nature.</span>  By his own admission, Tible and Alcantara were with the petitioner when they picked up the private complainant at the tricycle terminal in Valley 2, Sucat, Parañaque on June 30, 1991.  (<span style="font-style: italic;">TSN, April 18, 1996, pp. 5-9</span>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  Tible and Alcantara were also with the petitioner in the course of the drive to the coastal road where the first attempt on the witness' life allegedly took place.  (TSN, April 18, 1996, pp. 9-11)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  And they were also with the petitioner when the witness was taken to the Vizconde residence and allegedly instructed to clutch a knife beside three (3) dead persons (<span style="font-style: italic;">TSN, June 18, 1996, p. 34</span>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> whereupon another attempt was allegedly made by the petitioner to kill him.  From all indications, and assuming but without conceding these aspects of the private complainant's testimony to be true, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tible and Alcantara were principals by direct participation in the design to frame up the private complainant as the fall guy in the Vizconde massacre.</span>  The private complainant's testimony falls into pieces and fails to inspire belief and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>Biong thus poses as follows:<br><blockquote>Should you believe Cayubit who on April 18, 1996 testified that he could not inquire from Biong why he was forced to board the jeep <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because Biong always hurt him</span> whenever he would speak, <span style="font-weight: bold;">but</span> who, on June 18, 1996, upon questioning by the lower court, testified that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Biong assured him that he had nothing to be afraid of?</span>  Cayubit further testified that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he was not even cursed on that occasion</span> contrary to his earlier testimony that Biong would always hurt him whenever he spoke x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>This Court notes that Cayubit's account at the witness stand — that they stopped at the Coastal Road whereupon Biong removed Cayubit's handcuffs, let him alight from the jeep, and attempted to shoot him but was restrained by Tible and Alcantara — was glaringly not part of Cayubit's original detailed tale in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinumpaang Salaysay</span>.  With such novel claim made at the witness stand, it can be assumed that after Biong was restrained in his attempt along the Coastal Road to shoot Cayubit, the latter was not handcuffed.  It is surprising that with his hands already free on their way to the BF Homes Subdivision, Cayubit did not, while they stopped at the pub, escape.  Did he not claim that Tible and Alcantara were his <span style="font-style: italic;">"kakampi"</span>?<br><br>In the same vein, in light of Cayubit's claim that after they left the premises of the pub, Biong wrapped his head again with a jacket, it is improbable for him to remove the same considering that Biong was seated beside him.  Cayubit could not, therefore, have known to what direction they were going.<br><br>By his account, Cayubit fled the Vizconde residence by running.  How could the naked Cayubit have been able to escape?  And given his unclothed state, how could he have fled without arousing the suspicion of passersby?  <br><br>Why would Biong, while inside the jeep, ask Cayubit to strip off his clothes and underwear (to lend credence to the theory that he committed rape?) when a person in such unclothed state inside an open jeep would certainly catch attention?  Could not Biong have waited until they reached the Vizconde residence as after all what seemed to be the plan was to make it appear that he was the killer-rapist or one of the malefactors in the Vizconde massacre who was caught <span style="font-style: italic;">in flagrante</span>, hence, killed on the spot?  And that renders incredible too the alleged attempt of Biong to kill Cayubit at the Coastal Road.<br><br>It is, in light of these nagging questions, that this Court finds misplaced the application by the lower courts of the doctrine that affirmative testimony is stronger than negative testimony.<br><br>On top of his testimony failing the test of credibility, it not being in conformity to knowledge, observation and experience of ordinary men, Cayubit's credibility as a witness leaves much to be desired.  For he had a tendency to evade and contradict statements he had earlier made, as a sampling thereof from the following transcript of his testimony on June 4, 1996 reflects:<br><blockquote><table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="11%"><div align="left">[COURT] </div></td> <td width="89%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr>  <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">While you were on board . . . the vehicle together with Alcantara and Tible, d[id] you have any occasion to ask them why Biong got you and wanted to shoot you? </div></td> </tr>  <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">[CAYUBIT] </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I asked, your honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And what was their reply? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">They told me that this is the job of Biong and they were not informed about it and they do not know what he would do it to me, your honor.

And by his account, he was also afraid that he would get caught, he having learned from the television in August 1991 that he was being implicated in the Vizconde massacre, drawing him to even use the alias name of "Dennis Anemo[s]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>When asked, however, why he did not file a case against Biong, Tible and Alcantara <span style="text-decoration: underline;">despite his access to a lawyer after his arrest on December 6, 1991</span>, Cayubit replied that, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with respect to Tible and Alcantara,</span> he had no intention to file a case against them for as long as they were alive, he having used to run errands for Tible and thereby earned his living.  Parenthetically, given his information that he benefited from Tible's help, it is odd that Cayubit does not even know Tible's first name. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">With respect to Biong,</span> however, Cayubit could not proffer a satisfactory explanation.<br><br>This Court notes that the trial court and the Court of Appeals relied on <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.
