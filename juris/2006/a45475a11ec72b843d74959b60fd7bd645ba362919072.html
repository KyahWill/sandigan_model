				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These five consolidated petitions pray for the nullification of certain issuances of the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case No. 0002, "Republic of the Philippines v. Estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos, et al."<br><br>The complaint in Civil Case No. 0002 (or the case) was filed before the Sandiganbayan on July 16, 1987 by the Republic of the Philippines (the Republic) through the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) against former President and Mrs. Marcos, their three children, and some other individuals.   The complaint was later amended to implead additional defendants.<br><br>The case is for the recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses, among which are shares of stock in the Philippine Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC):  76,779 shares in the name of Ramon U. Cojuangco, 21,525 shares in the name of Imelda O. Cojuangco, and 111,415 shares in the name of Prime Holdings Incorporated (PHI).   PTIC is the biggest stockholder of PLDT, it owning some 28% of the outstanding shares in PLDT at the time Civil Case No. 0002 was filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>In the course of the proceedings in Civil Case No. 0002, the first three petitions assailing interlocutory orders of the Sandiganbayan were filed before this Court.<br><br>Thus, the petitions in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 149802 and 150320,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed by Alfonso Yuchengco and Y Realty Corporation,</span> complainants-in-intervention in Civil Case No. 0002, assail via petition for certiorari orders and resolutions of the Sandiganbayan denying their motions to suspend trial pending discovery proceedings and to re-set trial dates (with alternative prayer for a change in the order of trial), and declaring them as having waived their right to present evidence.<br><br>The petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150367,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed by the Republic,</span> assails via petition for certiorari the Sandiganbayan Orders denying its Respectful Motion for Additional Time to Complete the Presentation of Evidence and directing it to submit its offer of evidence within 30 days.<br><br>During the pendency of these first three petitions, the Sandiganbayan continued with the proceedings in Civil Case No. 0002, no restraining order enjoining the same having been issued by this Court.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan, still during the pendency of the first three petitions, promulgated in Civil Case No. 0002 a Partial Decision on May 6, 2002 the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complaint of plaintiff Republic of the Philippines on the PLDT shares subject of separate trial is hereby DISMISSED </span>for lack of merit.<br><br>The Motion for Summary Judgment [filed by Imelda Cojuangco, et al] is hereby <span style="text-decoration: underline;">GRANTED, and the Complaint-in-Intervention [filed by the Yuchengcos] DISMISSED.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">SO ORDERED.  (Underscoring supplied)</div></blockquote>The last two of the five petitions at bar, both for review on certiorari, were thereupon filed. The petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 153207</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed by the complainants-in-intervention Yuchengcos,</span>nd that in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 153459</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed by the Republic,</span> both challenge the Partial Decision.<br><br>The incidents that gave rise to the filing of the petitions are stated in the minority's dissenting opinion penned by Justice Cancio Garcia which immediately follows this majority opinion.  The dissenting opinion substantially reiterates the draft that Justice Garcia prepared which was used by this Court as a working basis for its deliberations.<br><br>In issue in these petitions are:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>Whether petitioners in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 149802, 150320 </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">150367</span> were denied due process when the Sandiganbayan in effect directed them to terminate the presentation of their respective evidence;  and<br><br></li><li> Whether the Partial Decision being assailed via petition for review in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 153207 and 153459,</span> conforms to the evidence presented, the law and/or settled jurisprudence.</li></ol></blockquote>There is no disagreement with respect to the disposition-dismissal by the minority of the first three petitions â€“ the first having become moot, and the second and third for lack of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Sandiganbayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  There is also no disagreement with respect to the disposition-denial by the minority of the fourth petition (G.R. No. 153207) in the absence of reversible error on the part of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>It is with respect to the disposition-denial by the minority of the fifth petition (G.R. No. 153459) insofar as it denied the prayer of the Republic for a judgment ordering the Estate of Ramon U. Cojuangco (Cojuangco), Imelda O. Cojuangco, PHI, their assigns, nominees and agents to reconvey to the Republic 111,415 PTIC shares registered in the name of PHI that the majority does not agree, in light of the immediately following discussions.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan having held in its 73-page Partial Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> that the Republic has failed to prove that the PLDT shares sought to be recovered are ill-gotten, thus:<br><blockquote>. . . the Republic has failed to provide such "proof of authenticity or reliability" of the documents offered by it in evidence.  Thus <span style="text-decoration: underline;">almost all the documents offered by the Republic are photocopies, and no effort was undertaken . . . to submit the originals of said documents, or to have them properly identified, or to otherwise justify the admission of mere photocopies.</span>  Not surprisingly, defendants . . . objected to the admission of the Republic's documentary exhibits, citing violation of the Best Evidence Rule (Section 3, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure ["Rules"], the Rules of Presentation of Documentary Evidence (Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules). The Hearsay Evidence Rule, and the rule as to Purpose/s of Documentary Evidence (Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Underscoring supplied),</blockquote>a discussion of the evidence presented in the case is in order.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF PHI AND ITS DEALINGS WITH PTIC</span><br><br>PHI was registered on October 5, 1977 with the following five (5) incorporators:  J<span style="font-weight: bold;">ose D.

The total amount of capital stock subscribed was thus P200,000.00, P50,000.00 of which was actually paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Its place of business was at 66 United Street, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The five PHI incorporators, in their capacity as stockholders, elected themselves as directors on October 10, 1977.

Campos, Jr. later assigned all their shares in PHI (400 shares each) to Cojuangco and PTIC Director Oscar Africa (Africa), respectively, via two separate deeds of assignment dated February 18, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On May 9, 1981, Cojuangco and Africa were elected directors of PHI, replacing Gapud and Jose D. Campos, Jr., while the other directors â€“ Lirio, Abalos, and Gaviola â€“ remained as such.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  On even date, Cojuangco and Africa were elected by the PHI Board of Directors as President and Vice-President, respectively, while de Guzman and Gaviola remained as Secretary and Treasurer, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, by Deed of Assignment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 1983</span> (the day is not indicated), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Africa transferred all his 400 PHI shares</span> â€“ 240 to Antonio Cojuangco and 160 to Trinidad Cojuangco Yulo.

No. 153459, namely: Estate of Ramon Cojuangco, Imelda O. Cojuangco, PHI, and Imelda R. Marcos all agree with petitioner Republic that PHI has an undisclosed beneficial owner, their only disagreement being who this owner is.<br><br>The Cojuangcos and PHI in their Comment proffer that the beneficial owners are the Cojuangcos, arguing as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x The unsupported allegation that President Marcos owned the disputed shares in PLDT, PTIC and PHI<span style="font-weight: bold;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> perhaps explain the circumstances surrounding PHI's incorporation, </span>why PTIC's stockholders were disinterested in purchasing PLDT's shares in 1977, why PTIC's stockholders waived their right of first refusal in 1978, why there are no proper entries in PHI's Stock and Transfer Book, or why the subject shareholdings were not included in Ramon U. Cojuangco's Estate inventory.  However, the converse syllogism is not true â€“ the details of PHI's incorporation, or the fact that PTIC's stockholders were disinterested in purchasing PLDT's shares in 1977, or that PTIC's stockholders waived their right of first refusal in 1978, or that there are no proper entries in PHI's Stock and Transfer Book, or that 400 PHI shares were not included in Ramon U. Cojuangco's Estate inventory do not necessarily establish that President Marcos owned the subject shares in PHI, PTIC and PLDT.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These circumstances show that PHI had an undisclosed principal and beneficial owner.  Subsequent events,</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> i.e. the <span style="font-style: italic;">assignment of shares</span> in 1981 and 1983, reveal and </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">confirm that Mr. Ramon U. Cojuangco and his family were the principal and beneficial owners of PHI,</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and, corollarily, the subject PHI, PTIC and PLDT shares, not President Marcos.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  (Emphasis, italics and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, consistent with the theory of petitioner Republic, claims that she, her late husband President Marcos, and their family were the beneficial owners of PHI, alleging in her Cross-claim filed before the Sandiganbayan as follows:<br><blockquote>6.1 <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">PHI was incorporated to serve as the holding company of all the PTIC shares owned by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos and family,</span> in addition to those being held by trustees/nominees like defendants Ramon and Imelda Cojuangco.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For this purpose, PHI was organized with the following as incorporators, all of whom were the trustees/nominees of the Marcoses:<br><br></span><table Ã¯Â¿Â½="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td>Jose D. Campos</td><td>- 400 shares</td></tr><tr><td>Rolando C. Gapud</td><td>- 400   "</td></tr><tr><td>Renato E. Lirio</td><td>- 400   "</td></tr><tr><td>Gervaso T.

No. 14-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> clearly states that the degree of proof required in cases such as the one at bar is <span style="font-weight: bold;">preponderance of evidence.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote>Sec. 3. The civil suits to recover unlawfully acquired property under Republic Act No. 1379 or for restitution, reparation of damages, or indemnification for consequential and other damages or any other civil actions under the Civil Code or other existing laws filed with the Sandiganbayan against Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, members of their immediate family, close relatives, subordinates, close and/or business associates, dummies, agents and nominees, may proceed independently of any criminal proceedings and may be proved by a preponderance of evidence.  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The Sandiganbayan, therefore, was not to look for proof beyond reasonable doubt, but to determine, based on the evidence presented, in light of common human experience, which of the theories proffered by the parties is more worthy of credence.  The case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Joaquin v. Navarro</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>x x x<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> "Juries must often reason," says one author, "according to probabilities, drawing an inference that the main fact in issue existed from collateral facts not directly proving, but strongly tending to prove, its existence. The vital question in such cases is the cogency of the proof afforded by the secondary facts. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How likely, according to experience, is the existence of the primary fact if certain secondary facts exist?"</span></span> (1 Moore on Facts, Sec. 596.)  The same author tells us of a case where "a jury was justified in drawing the inference that the person who was caught firing a shot at an animal trespassing on his land was the person who fired a shot about an hour before at the same animal also trespassing."  That conclusion was not airtight, but rational.  In fact, the circumstances in the illustration leave greater room for another possibility than do the facts of the case at hand.<br><br>In conclusion, the presumption that Angela Joaquin de Navarro died before her son is based purely on surmises, speculations, or conjectures without any sure foundation in the evidence.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The opposite theory</span> - that the mother outlived her son - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is deduced from established facts which, <span style="font-weight: bold;">weighed by common experience,</span> engender the inference as a very strong probability.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gauged by the doctrine of preponderance of evidence by which civil cases are decided, this inference ought to prevail</span>. x x x</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>   (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The evidence presented by the parties shows that the preponderance clearly lies with the Republic, but the Sandiganbayan grossly misappreciated it and, therefore, committed a reversible error.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ramos, Sr. v. Gatchalian Realty, Inc.,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this Court ruled:<br><blockquote>Once again, we apply the rule that findings of facts of the Court of Appeals are binding on the Supreme Court and will not be overturned when supported by the evidence on record <span style="text-decoration: underline;">save in the known exceptions such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">gross misappreciation of the evidence </span>or <span style="font-weight: bold;">misapprehension of facts.</span></span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>   (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br>Moreover, the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Salazar v. Gutierrez</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> teaches:<br><br>It bears repeating that the finding thus made, although apparently factual in character, is premised upon supposed absence of evidence, and therefore is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reviewed by this Court if the premise is clearly contradicted by the record or unjustified upon other considerations which logically lead to a different conclusion, but which the decision under review did not take into account</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">THE TESTIMONIES OF CAMPOS, GAPUD, AND ATTY. FRANCISCO DE GUZMAN (De Guzman) ESTABLISH THE MARCOSES' OWNERSHIP OF PHI</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">SWORN STATEMENT AND DEPOSITION OF JOSE YAO CAMPOS</span><br><br>It is not disputed that Jose Yao Campos (hereinafter referred to as Campos) is a former Marcos crony who, after the February 1986 EDSA Revolution, surrendered to the government substantial assets which he confessed to have held in behalf of Marcos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  He is one of the Republic's witnesses in the case.  In his SWORN STATEMENT dated March 21, 1986 taken at Vancouver, Canada, the authenticity and truthfulness of which was re-affirmed by him during the taking of his deposition on November 23-25, 1994, also at Vancouver, Campos made the following significant admissions:<br><ol type="1"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> My relationship with the then President Ferdinand E.

Nonetheless, the Sandiganbayan, after finding that "almost all the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">documents</span> offered by the Republic are photocopies" (underscoring supplied) and ruling that the same were unreliable, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">omitted any discussion of the evidentiary weight of the Republic's </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">testimonial</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> evidence, including the deposition-statement of Campos quoted above. </span> Notwithstanding Campos' testimony linking Marcos to PHI (and thus to the subject PTIC shares pertaining to PHI), the graft court concluded that "[t]here is no competent evidence to tie defendant Ferdinand Marcos with PTIC."<br><br>In so ruling, the Sandiganbayan grossly misappreciated, it bears repeating, the weight of the evidence presented by the Republic, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reducing to naught Campos' categorical statement that </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PHI is one of the corporations he organized in behalf of Marcos</span> and that in "[a]ll the corporations [he] organized â€“ that was the standard policy </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">â€“</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> that we surrendered [a Deed of Trust or Deed of Assignment] direct to President Marcos."</span><br><br>The minority, however, attempts to supply what is lacking in the Sandiganbayan decision by citing grounds why this Court should not give weight to the testimony of Campos.<br><br>While the minority acknowledges that it is a fact deducible from Campos' sworn declarations that he adhered to a set of patterns or practices when he organized corporations for then President Marcos, it opines that "Mr. Campos was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unable to declare with certitude</span> if these patterns and practices were followed vis-Ã -vis PHI."  (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>On the contrary, Campos plainly meant that the "patterns and practices" he mentioned were followed in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> corporations organized on behalf of Marcos, including PHI.<br><br>The minority goes on to state: "Accordingly, the question begging an answer is whether there truly exists, in respect to PHI shares, certificates indorsed in blank or <span style="font-weight: bold;">deed of trust or assignment</span> in favor of an unnamed beneficiary delivered to the late President.  If there is one person who can provide a satisfactory answer to this question, it is Mr. Campos.  But he is not saying anything."  (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>On the contrary, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Campos answered the question clearly when he declared that PHI was one of the corporations that he organized for President Marcos</span> and that <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">all</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> such corporations were subject to the </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">same policy regarding the issuance of deeds of assignment in blank.</span><br><br>The only issue on which Campos showed a lack of certitude was whether PHI actually held PTIC shares in its name.  It must be borne in mind, however, that as earlier stated, it was PHI President <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gapud</span> with whom Cojuangco and Rivilla forged an agreement for the two to sell a total of 111,415 of the PTIC shares to PHI as indeed they did convey them on May 2, 1978.  Besides, such issue turns out <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not to have been raised </span>in this case since <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the existence of such PTIC shares in the name of PHI is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> being disputed,</span> as the Sandiganbayan decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  states and as the pleadings show.<br><br>In any event, Campos' lack of knowledge regarding PHI's holdings in PTIC cannot be considered fatal to his credibility, since this lack of knowledge is fully accounted for by the extent of Campos' participation in the transactions of PHI.  The testimony on cross examination of the Republic's witness de Guzman is enlightening on this matter.<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">[Atty.

Campos' lack of knowledge of PHI's holdings in PTIC, therefore, ceases to be a point against the reliability of his testimony.<br><br>In a further bid to undermine Campos' credibility, the minority, in a glaring slip of itself "accord[ing] primacy to speculation," states that, "[h]aving suffered a heart attack sometime in 1979, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Campos must have in mind the necessity of cutting a deal with the PCGG,</span> so as to relieve him and his family of the enormous pressures they were experiencing at that time", and that Campos, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"a man in obvious duress, appeared ready to do anything to conclude such a deal."</span><br><br>This Court, however, instead of speculating about the motives of Campos, would rather make a fair assessment or evaluation of the truth or falsity of Campos' statements.  After such an assessment, the Court has come to the conclusion that Campos' deposition is worthy of credence.<br><br>With regard to the statement of Campos that he never had any discussion or correspondence with Marcos regarding the latter's beneficial ownership of PTIC and PHI â€“ which, to the minority, renders Campos' testimony incredible, attention is invited to this Court's injunction in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Pailanco</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that "[t]he testimony of a witness must be considered and calibrated in its entirety and not by truncated portions thereof or isolated passages therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>An examination of Campos' statement in its proper context reveals that, before he was asked if he ever had any discussions or correspondences with Marcos regarding his beneficial ownership in PTIC or PHI, there was a long line of successive questions that all focused on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PTIC</span> shares held by PHI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Thus, setting aside any preconception that Campos merely cut a deal with the PCGG, or that he was one who was "ready to do anything to conclude such a deal," and bearing in mind this Court's pronouncement that even the most candid of witnesses commit mistakes and even make confused and inconsistent statements,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> it can reasonably be inferred that Campos merely misapprehended the question posed to him and thought that it was still referring only to PHI's holdings in PTIC.  Campos should not, therefore, be understood as saying that he never talked to Marcos about PHI; rather, he was referring only to PTIC, and this statement of Campos that he never talked to Marcos about PHI's holdings in PTIC is only consistent with his earlier statement that he was not aware that PHI held such shares.<br><br>The credibility of Campos thus stands, and his sworn admission that PHI was a dummy corporation organized for former President Marcos constitutes convincing evidence that PHI was beneficially owned by Marcos.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DEPOSITION OF GAPUD</span><br><br>Gapud, one of the incorporators of PHI, affirmed Campos' sworn statement quoted above that he is his associate.  His deposition taken at the Philippine Consulate Office in Hong Kong on October 18-20 and December 11-12, 1995 substantially corroborates the statements of Campos and further establishes that PHI was a dummy corporation of the Marcoses.<br><blockquote>CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  Do you know the beneficial owner or owners of Prime Holdings, Inc.?<br><br>MR.

GAPUD: Well, as I said earlier the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shares and/or assignments indorsed in blank were delivered by Mr. Campos to President Marcos.</span></span><br><br>CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  The same heirs likewise alleged:<br><blockquote>"In separate Deeds of Assignment dated 18 February 1981, two (2) of the incorporators of Prime Holdings, namely:  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rolando C. Gapud and Jose D. Campos, Jr., assigned and conveyed to Messrs. Ramon U. Cojuangco and Oscar Africa, respectively, all their shareholdings in Prime, </span>consisting of four hundred (400) shares of stock each, or twenty (20%) percent each of the shares of stock of Prime (Annexes "C" and "C-1")."</blockquote>Question:  Based on your personal knowledge, do you affirm or deny the said allegation?<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>MR. GAPUD:  Madam Consul, I think I can only affirm that which pertains to me, namely:  the Deed of Assignment that I signed.  I will leave it to Mr. Campos to affirm his Deed of Assignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  May we continue?<br><br>Showing you the said Annex "C" now marked as Exhibit "F" for purposes of this proceeding, do you affirm or deny the authenticity of this document?<br><br>MR. GAPUD:  Yes, I affirm.<br><br>CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is it really true that you assigned your 400 shares to Ramon U. Cojuangco?</span><br><br>MR. GAPUD:  Yes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>As with the testimony of Campos, the Sandiganbayan did not explain its reasons for holding that, notwithstanding the existence of Gapud's testimony in the records, there is no competent evidence to support the Republic's thesis. The minority, however, passing upon the above-quoted testimony, expresses the view that Gapud contradicted himself with respect to the disposition of his 400 shares in PHI, since "it would have been implausible for him to make the assignment to Mr. Cojuangco if the covering certificates had previously been delivered to Pres. Marcos."  (Underscoring supplied)<br><br>This argument, however, misinterprets the statement of Gapud, since he did not specifically state that covering certificates were delivered to President Marcos, but only that "shares of stock <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">or </span>the assignments indorsed in blank were delivered to President Marcos by Mr. Campos" (emphasis and underscoring supplied).  Gapud was thus proferring the possibility that only deeds of assignment were delivered to the former President.  Hence, there is no reason to read a contradiction into his statements.  Significantly, de Guzman would confirm in his testimony that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only deeds of assignment,</span> and not stock certificates, were issued in PHI, as will be discussed below.<br><br>Gapud's statement relating the subsequent execution of deeds of assignment to Cojuangco and his kin does not detract from the prior delivery of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blank</span> deeds to President Marcos, especially so in this case where, by Gapud's own recounting, he and his co-incorporators executed the 1981 and 1983 deeds of assignment <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with the knowledge and authorization of the same person to whom the earlier deeds were delivered â€“ President Marcos.</span><br><blockquote>VICE CONSUL HERNANDEZ:  Can we note your objection and let Mr. Gapud answer?<br><br>So the aforesaid Deeds of Assignments obviously will be with the knowledge and upon authorization and order of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, is this correct?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MR. GAPUD: Considering that Prime Holdings, Inc. was incorporated upon the instructions of former President Marcos, obviously all the nominees would act only upon his authorization.  That's my answer.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>That the incorporators signed the deeds of assignment as nominees of Marcos, moreover, is consistent with another statement of Gapud which reveals that he received virtually nothing in return for the PHI shares he assigned to Cojuangco.<br><blockquote>CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How much</span> did you receive as consideration            for assigning your shares to him?<br><br>MR. GAPUD:  The consideration for the assignment was that upon my assignment, first, my fiduciary responsibilities as nominee were extinguished, and secondly, I had transferred and extinguished any and all liabilities under the subscription payable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Moreover, as with Campos's testimony, the minority considers Gapud's supposed ignorance of PHI's holdings in PTIC as undermining his credibility, basing this finding on the following portion of his testimony:<br><blockquote>CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  Do you know anything about the Philippine Telecommunication Investment Corporation (PTIC), 46% of the capital stock of which is owned by Prime Holdings, Inc.?<br><br>MR. GAPUD:  Well, very little except for that which I have read from the newspapers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote>Even a cursory reading of the question posed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gapud, however, would suffice to clarify what he meant to say.  Clearly, Gapud was not being asked whether he knew anything about PHI's holdings in PTIC but only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether he knew anything about PTIC itself as a corporation.</span></span>  Gapud's meager knowledge about PTIC, in spite of PHI's holdings therein, far from being incredible, is perfectly consistent with his admission that he was merely a Marcos nominee.  Why expect him to be knowledgeable of PTIC when the person really interested in PTIC was neither him nor anyone else in PHI but their principal â€“ Marcos?<br><br>Gapud's statements thus complement those made by Campos, further strengthening the Republic's claim that PHI is a corporation beneficially owned by the Marcoses.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DEPOSITION OF DE GUZMAN</span><br><br>The Republic also presented the deposition of de Guzman, former corporate secretary of PHI, taken at the Mandarin Hotel, Makati City on June 12, 2001.  His testimony also sheds light on the origins and organization of PHI, and substantially corroborates the statements of Campos and Gapud discussed above.  To properly appreciate the import of de Guzman's testimony, it is needful to recall the avowals of Campos regarding his family's participation in UNILAB, as in his (de Guzman's) deposition, he mentions UNILAB several times.<br><br>Responding to the questions during the taking of his deposition, de Guzman stated as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">So, you were an in-house counsel for UNILAB? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was Mr. Jose Yao Campos' position or role in UNILAB at that time, in 1969? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When I joined UNILAB he was Chairman of the Board, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was he also the majority stockholder of UNILAB? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir, I think he is a majority stockholder. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Now the original list of stockholders of Prime Holdings, Inc. were Jose D.

Indeed, even the minority had to acknowledge that Gapud was a mere nominee, merely denying that his principal was Marcos, contrary to Gapud's own admission.   However, perhaps unable to account for the undeniable fact that all the incorporators of PHI are Campos associates, the minority implies that the true owner was neither Marcos nor Cojuangco, but Campos himself â€“ contrary to the Cojuangcos' submission that <span style="font-style: italic;">Ramon Cojuangco</span> was the beneficial owner, and to Campos' admission that he organized PHI for <span style="font-style: italic;">President Marcos.</span><br><br>Moreover, the thesis that Marcos owned PHI is able to make more sense of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undisputed</span> assignment of PTIC shares to PHI by Cojuangco.  If PHI were beneficially owned by Cojuangco, then the transfer of these PTIC shares to PHI would merely have been a transfer to himself.  On the other hand, on the thesis that PHI is beneficially owned by Marcos, the assignment thereof to PHI was a transfer from Cojuangco to President Marcos.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">On the basis of the evidence, therefore, President Marcos owned PHI and all the incorporators thereof acted under his direction.</span> Once this is acknowledged, the following conclusions inevitably follow:<br><ol type="1"><blockquote><li> Cojuangco was elected President and took over the management of PHI in 1981 with the cooperation of the Marcos nominees who, it must be emphasized, still held the majority stockholding as of that date;<br><br></li><li> As the remaining incorporators on the Board divested their shares only in 1983, Cojuangco managed a Marcos-controlled corporation for at least two years;<br><br></li><li> The simultaneous divestment of shares by the three remaining incorporators on the Board to Cojuangco's close relatives in 1983 were with the knowledge and authorization of their principal â€“ President Marcos.</li></blockquote></ol>Clearly, all these circumstances mark out Cojuangco either as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nominee</span> of Marcos as was Gapud whom he replaced as President of PHI or, at the very least, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">close associate</span> of Marcos.

The Sandiganbayan considered these deeds as competent evidence, as opposed to the purported lack of such evidence on the part of the Republic.  The most these deeds could show, however, is that the Cojuangcos acquired PHI shares in the years 1981 and 1983, long after the 111,415 PTIC shares were acquired in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1978 </span>by PHI.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">On the decisive question of whether the incorporators who organized PHI in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1977</span> acted as Marcos (or Cojuangco) nominees, these deeds are absolutely silent.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>In marked contrast, the testimonies of Campos, Gapud, and de Guzman, persons who actually participated in the formation and early years of operation of PHI, constitute evidence that directly addresses the critical issue.<br><br>Indubitably, the preponderance of evidence lies with the Republic.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MISAPPLICATION OF<span style="font-style: italic;"> BASECO v.

Such inference is thus valid only to the extent that it was logically contemplated in the BASECO decision itself.<br><br>It bears noting that, in <span style="font-style: italic;">BASECO,</span> this Court determined the extent of the powers vested in the PCGG for the purpose of <span style="font-style: italic;">preserving</span> suspected ill-gotten wealth.  These were in the nature of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">provisional</span> remedies, e.g., sequestration, freeze orders, and the like, preparatory to a judicial finding that such properties are indeed ill-gotten.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>   It is unlike the case at bar where this Court will now <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finally</span> determine on the merits whether a particular property is, <span style="font-weight: bold;">in fact</span>, ill-gotten.<br><br>A reading of <span style="font-style: italic;">BASECO</span> would reveal that it did not intend to establish evidentiary norms for all future cases involving the Marcos wealth.  Nowhere does it state that the failure of the Republic to present as evidence blank deeds of assignment is fatal to its cause.  The most that can be gathered from <span style="font-style: italic;">BASECO</span> in this regard is that this Court therein found that there were blank deeds of assignment and stock certificates endorsed in blank recovered in MalacaÃ±ang which were considered <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> evidence to justify the exercise of PCGG's powers of sequestration, freeze order, and the like.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nowhere in <span style="font-style: italic;">BASECO </span>is any pronouncement that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> such kind of evidence suffices to prove Marcos ownership of corporations, to the exclusion of other evidence such as the deposition-sworn statements of the confessed Marcos cronies in the instant case.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">EPILOGUE</span><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">PCGG v.

No. 153459 to the extent that it prays for the reconveyance to the Republic of the Philippines of  111,415 shares of stock of the Philippine Telecommunication Investment Corp. (PTIC) registered in the name of Prime Holdings Inc. (PHI).<br><br>PTIC is the biggest stockholder of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT), owning 28% of its outstanding shares or totaling approximately 625 million PLDT shares valued at approximately 1.6 billion    pesos.<br><br>The shares of stock of PTIC are registered in the following names: 111,415 (46% of total shares) are held by PHI; 76,779 were held by Ramon Cojuangco during his lifetime; and 21,525 are held by Imelda Cojuangco (44% of total shares).<br><br>In its Amended Complaint for Reconveyance, Reversion, Accounting, Restitution and Damages, the Republic of the Philippines, through the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), alleges, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia,</span> that these PTIC shares of stock held by PHI and the Cojuangcos belong in truth and in fact to the Marcoses.  In other words, PHI and the Cojuangcos are mere    dummies/conduits/nominees of the Marcoses who effectively owned PTIC and, necessarily, the disputed shares of stock of PLDT.<br><br>Pursuant to its mandate, the PCGG filed the complaint for reversion of the Marcoses' ill-gotten wealth including these PLDT shares of stock to the Republic.<br><br>In their respective Answers, PHI and the Cojuangcos vehemently deny that the Marcos family owned the disputed shares of stock.  PHI, in particular, asserted that the members of the family of the late Ramon Cojuangco own <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> the outstanding shares in PHI.<br><br>Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, admitted in her Answer that they hold beneficial ownership over these shares of stock.  She maintained that their wealth was lawfully acquired.<br><br>Alfonso Yuchengco and Y Corp. filed a complaint in intervention seeking to recover from the Cojuangcos their shares of stock and asserting ownership thereof as against the Republic.  Yuchengco claims that the Marcos regime compelled him into giving up 6% of PTIC shares formerly owned by Gregorio Romulo and Leonides Virata and deprived him of exercising his option to buy General Telephone and Electronics, Inc.'s (GTE's) 25% equity in PTIC. This 25% equity in PTIC was subsequently acquired by PHI.<br><br>After protracted hearings, the Sandiganbayan rendered the assailed Partial Decision dated May 6, 2002 dismissing the Republic's complaint insofar as it seeks to recover the PLDT shares.<br><br>The petition in G.R. No. 153459 is filed by the Republic assailing the Partial Decision. Yuchengco and Y Corp. also assail the said Partial Decision in their petition in G.R. No. 153207.<br><br>The petition in G.R. No. 150367 is filed by the Republic assailing the Sandiganbayan's Order denying its Respectful Motion for Additional Time to Complete the Presentation of Evidence.  The petitions in G.R. Nos. 149802 and 150320 were filed by Yuchengco and Y Corp. assailing the Orders of the Sandiganbayan denying their motions to suspend trial pending discovery proceedings and cancellation of hearings.  The Sandiganbayan declared them to have waived their right to present evidence.<br><br>In the Partial Decision, the Sandiganbayan ruled that the Republic failed to prove that the PLDT shares are part of the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses.  Consequently, it affirmed the PHI's and the Cojuangco's ownership over the disputed shares.  The Sandiganbayan held that "almost all the documents offered by the Republic are photocopies;" thus, the latter failed to provide "such proof of authenticity or reliability:"<br><blockquote>We are therefore constrained to find that the Republic's documentary evidence, to the extent that they are mere photocopies, or are otherwise unidentified, unauthenticated, and constitutive of hearsay, may not be justifiably relied upon by this Court, nor may their integrity be assumed, for their purpose of establishing the facts, or for supporting the theory pursued by the Republic.<br><br>More particularly, there is no competent evidence to show that defendant Ferdinand Marcos had any hand in PTIC, or in the acquisition by the defendants Cojuangco in their own names of any of their shares therein.  There is no competent evidence to establish or even infer, the existence of a relationship of trust between the defendants Cojuangco and defendant Ferdinand Marcos with PTIC, or to establish that presidential concessions, benefits, or other incentives that could have improved the financial and operational situation of PTIC, PLDT, and PHI, were accorded said companies by defendant Ferdinand Marcos.  Accordingly, there is no competent evidence to prove the Republic's allegation that the PLDT shares herein were ill-gotten.<br><br>On the other hand, there is evidence for the defense which establishes the fact that all shares in PHI were vested upon defendant Ramon U. Cojuangco and his family.  Thus documents were offered in evidence plainly naming and identifying Ramon U. Cojuangco and members of his family as assignees of PHI shares, and in the absence of blank Deeds of Assignment and/or Deeds of trust executed by stockholders of PHI, said corporation may not be said to have been organized for defendant Marcos's benefit.  To reiterate, it is the existence of such blank Deeds of Assignment and/or Deeds of Trust that distinguishes corporations asserted to be owned by defendant Ferdinand Marcos from the others.<br><br>More importantly, with the assignment of PHI shares specifically to defendant Ramon U. Cojuangco and members of his family, defendant Ferdinand Marcos lost the essential legal instrumentation or mechanism upon which he could have claimed the shares in ownership or compel the reconveyance thereof to him.<br><br>Likewise, there is, by the evidence, sufficient basis to conclude that the defendants Cojuangco acquired the shares in their names in PTIC as the actual and beneficial owners thereof.  In fact, based on plaintiff's own offered document, it is clear and indubitable that defendants Cojuangco were original stockholders of PTIC, hence held some of their shares therein as early as 1967.  These shares have been claimed by them in actual and beneficial ownership.  When defendant Ramon U. Cojuangco died on May 6, 1984, the 76,779 PTIC shares registered in his name were declared as part of his estate. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan, in fine, ruled that the Republic failed to prove by preponderant evidence that PTIC as well as the disputed shares in PLDT belonged to the Marcoses.<br><br>The majority opinion further adds the following relevant facts:<br><br>PHI was incorporated in 1977 by Jose D. Campos (son of Jose Yao Campos), Gapud, Renato Lirio, Ernesto Abalos and Gervacio Gaviola, with 400 shares each in their names.  These incorporators were also the officers of PHI.<br><br>Meanwhile, in 1977, 54,349 shares of PTIC, originally owned by GTE, a US corporation, were acquired by Ramon Cojuangco, who was then PTIC President and member of its board of directors.<br><br>In 1978, together with Luis Revilla, another stockholder of PTIC, Ramon Cojuangco ceded a total of 111,415 PTIC shares to PHI through several deeds of assignment.<br><br>In 1981, Gapud and Jose D. Campos later assigned all their shares in PHI (400 shares each) to Cojuangco and Oscar Africa, respectively, through separate deeds of assignment.<br><br>On that same year, Cojuangco and Africa became directors of PHI and its President and Vice-President, respectively.<br><br>In 1983, Africa transferred his 400 PHI shares to Antonio Cojuangco and Trinidad Cojuangco Yulo.  Also, Lirio, Abalos and Gaviola, remaining incorporators of PHI, transferred their 1,200 shares in PHI to members of the Cojuangco family through deeds of assignment.  In effect, the Cojuangcos acquired full control of PHI.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Deposition of Campos</span><br><br>Campos was a Marcos crony.  He categorically stated that he organized corporations for and in behalf of Pres. Marcos. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He gave a list of these corporations which included PHI.</span>  It was his policy that "whenever such corporation is organized for and on behalf of the intended beneficiaries, I execute and require all my said business associates to execute a Deed of Trust or Deed of Assignment duly signed in favor of unnamed beneficiary and to deliver the original copy thereof to the former President."<br><br>In 1979, he suffered a severe heart attack; thus, he transferred to Gapud the management of these corporations.<br><br>When categorically asked during his deposition whether the policy of executing deeds of trust or assignment in favor of an "unnamed beneficiary" and delivering them to then Pres. Marcos was followed in the case of PHI, Campos replied that "all the corporations I organized " that was the standard policy " that we surrendered direct to President Marcos."<br><br>These statements were corroborated by the testimony of de Guzman on cross-examination to the effect that he received instructions from Campos to organize PHI and thereafter, he (Campos) told him that it was Gapud who would be giving instructions regarding PHI.<br><br>The foregoing statements clearly show that PHI was one of the corporations organized by Campos for and in behalf of Pres. Marcos and that in all the corporations he organized, it was the standard policy that they surrendered [a deed of trust or assignment] direct to the latter.  In other words, PHI was beneficially owned by Pres. Marcos.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Deposition of Gapud</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>Gapud was one of the incorporators of PHI and a close associate of Campos.  When asked whether he knew the beneficial owners of PHI, Gapud answered that what he knew was that "the shares of stock and/or assignments endorsed in blank were delivered to Pres. Marcos by Mr. Campos."  Also, that the deed of assignment in blank covering his (Gapud's) 400 shares in PHI was delivered by Campos to Pres. Marcos.  However, he affirmed that he subsequently transferred these shares to Ramon Cojuangco through a deed of assignment.<br><br>Gapud's testimony corroborates Campos' statement that PHI was organized for and in behalf of Pres. Marcos.  There is no contradiction between Gapud's claims that blank deed of assignment covering his shares in PHI was delivered to Pres. Marcos and, later, he executed a deed of assignment covering these same shares in favor of Cojuangco.<br><br>I agree with the disquisitions of the majority that Gapud's statement relating to the subsequent execution of deeds of assignment to Cojuangco and his kin does not detract from the prior delivery of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blank</span> deeds to the former President, especially so in this case where, by Gapud's own recounting, he and his co-incorporators executed the 1981 and 1983 deeds of assignment with the knowledge and authorization of the same person to whom the earlier deeds were delivered â€“ President Marcos.<br><blockquote>VICE CONSUL HERNANDEZ. â€“<br><br>So the aforesaid Deeds of Assignments obviously were with the knowledge and upon authorization and order of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, is this correct?<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">MR. GAPUD.  Considering that Prime Holdings, Inc. was incorporated upon the instructions of former President Marcos, obviously all the nominees would act only upon his authorization.  That's my answer.</span></blockquote>As gleaned from the deposition of Gapud, there is practically no consideration for the transfer by Gapud of his shares to Cojuangco:<br><blockquote>CONSUL AGUILUCHO.  How much did you receive as consideration for assigning your shares to him?<br><br>MR GAPUD. The consideration for the assignment was that upon my assignment, first, my fiduciary responsibilities as nominee were extinguished, and secondly, I had transferred and extinguished any and all liabilities under the subscription payable.</blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Deposition of de Guzman</span><br><br>De Guzman was the Corporate Secretary of PHI.  In his testimony, de Guzman identified the original incorporators of PHI, namely, Gapud, Lirio, Gaviola and Abalos, as close associates of Campos.  The other incorporator, Jose D. Campos, Jr., was the latter's son.  The office of PHI was within the premises of the United Laboratories, another corporation controlled by Campos.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, there is nary any evidence on Cojuangco's role in the organization of PHI to substantiate the thesis that the same was beneficially owned by Cojuangco.  On the other hand, the Republic's thesis that President Marcos is the beneficial owner of PHI "is deduced from established facts which, weighed by common experience, engender the inference as a very strong probability."  Preponderance of evidence lies with the Republic.<br><br>On the basis of the evidence on record, I am convinced that that President Marcos owned PHI and all the incorporators thereof acted under his direction and that once this is acknowledged, the following conclusions inevitably follow:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Cojuangco was elected President and took over the management of PHI on 1981 with the cooperation of the Marcos nominees who, it must be emphasized, still held the majority stockholding as of that date;<br><br></li><li> As the remaining incorporators on the Board divested their shares only in 1983, Cojuangco managed a Marcos-controlled corporation for at least two years;<br><br></li><li> The simultaneous divestment of shares by the three remaining incorporators on the Board to Cojuangco's close relatives in 1983 were with the knowledge and authorization of their Principal â€“ President Marcos.</li></ol></blockquote>The preponderance of evidence lies with the Republic with respect to the 111,415 shares of PTIC registered in the name of PHI.  Such evidence consists of the statement of Campos as corroborated by the statements of Gapud and De Guzman.<br><br>For clarity, the ownership of the outstanding PTIC shares are divided as follows:<br><ul><li>111,415 shares are held by the Prime Holdings Inc. (PHI);</li></ul><ul><li>76,779 were held by Ramon Cojuangco during his lifetime and;</li></ul><ul><li>21,525 are held by Imelda Cojuangco.</li></ul>Thus, 46% of the total shares are held by PHI while the other 44% are held by the Cojuangcos.  However, as shown earlier, the Cojuangco family eventually acquired control of PHI when, in 1983, its incorporators transferred their shares to the former.<br><br>With respect to the incorporation of PHI, the following allegations in the Sworn Statement dated March 21, 1986 of Campos are enlightening:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> My relationship with the then President Ferdinand E. Marcos dates back to the time when he was first elected as Congressman </span>of the then Philippine Congress.  The relationship continued when he was then elected President of the Republic of the Philippines.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thereafter I assisted in the organization and acquisition of some business ventures for the former President.  Following his directive I instructed my lawyers and requested the assistance of my other business associates and officers of the company to organize, establish and manage these business ventures for and on behalf of the President;</span><br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The companies that we have organized <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for and on behalf of former President Marcos are listed in Annex "A"</span> attached herewith;</span><br><br></li><li> In the organization, administration and management of the abovenamed corporations, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> my <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">policy</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that whenever such a corporation is organized for and on behalf of the intended beneficiaries, I execute and I require all my said business associates to execute a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Deed of Trust or Deed of Assignment</span> duly signed in favour of an unnamed beneficiary and to deliver the original copy thereof to the former President.  It is in fact my <span style="font-weight: bold;">policy</span> and procedure that we disclaim completely any interest in any of such businesses and make it clear to the former President that we hold such interests on his behalf;</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></li><li> In the latter part of 1979 suffered a severe heart attack and was confined in the intensive care unit of the Makati Medical Center. x x x<br><br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Occasioned by the withdrawal of my active participation in the management of the abovenamed corporations, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr. Rolando C. Gapud</span> who was my financial consultant took over the direct responsibility of directing, managing and administering all the activities of the said corporations.  However, since Mr. Gapud did not have the administrative staff to efficiently manage the businesses, he requested me that all the employees and officers involved in the organization should continue to remain in the companies even only in a nominal capacity</span> considering that they had previously disclaimed any interest therein.  It is for this reason that Rolando C. Gapud and my business associates, namely, Mariano K. Tan, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jose D. Campos, Jr.,</span> Luciano E.

In your Sworn Statement, page 2, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you stated that with respect to the corporations you held in trust for President Marcos, it was your "policy" that whenever such a corporation was organized, you executed, and you required all your business associates to execute, A Deed of Trust or Deed of Assignment in favor of an "unnamed beneficiary", and delivered the originals thereof to President Marcos.</span>  x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Was this "policy" followed in the case of [PHI]?</span> x x x<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">ANSWER:  All the corporations I organized " that was the standard policy " that we surrendered direct to President Marcos.</span><br><br>3.1  Was it also your policy to deliver to President Marcos the stock certificates that you and your business associates held in trust for him?<br><br>ANSWER:  Yes, Ma'm.<br><br>3.2 If stock certificates that you and your business associates held in trust for President Marcos were delivered to him was it also your policy to have the stock certificates indorsed in blank?

("Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">The admissions of Campos are judicial; hence, conclusive on him and his successors-in-interest.

For their part, the Cojuangcos failed to allege, much less show, that the admissions of Campos were made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.</b><br><br>It bears stressing that under Executive Order No. 14, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the quantum of evidence required in cases involving forfeiture proceedings is preponderance of evidence,<span style="font-style: italic;"> i.e.,</span> "evidence which is of greater weight, or more convincing than that which is offered in opposition to it.  The term "preponderance of evidence" means the weight, credit and value of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be synonymous with the terms "greater weight of evidence" or "greater weight of the credible evidence." Preponderance of the evidence means evidence which is offered in opposition thereto." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The testimony of Campos, as corroborated by Gapud and de Guzman, that he organized PHI for and in behalf of Pres. Marcos should be accorded great probative weight.  The incorporators of the said corporation were close associates of Campos and, in fact, Gapud admitted that he did not really own the shares registered in his name and that the deed of assignment covering these shares was delivered by Campos to Pres. Marcos.<br><br>Reliance by the dissenting opinion on the deeds of assignment purportedly executed by the PHI incorporators in favor of Cojuangco family members is misplaced. The fact that in these deeds of assignments the Cojuangcos were specifically named, does not constitute proof that the beneficial ownership of PHI belonged to the Cojuangcos although they (deeds of assignment with specific names) deviated from the "standard practice" mentioned by Campos of delivering invariably <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blank</span> deeds of assignment to Pres. Marcos.<br><br>To reiterate, there is no evidence at all that there was a consideration for the transfer by the incorporators of their shares in favor of the Cojuangcos.  As Gapud stated in his deposition:<br><blockquote>CONSUL AGUILUCHO: How much did you receive as consideration for assigning your shares to him [referring to Ramon Cojuangco]?<br><br>MR. GAPUD: The consideration for the assignment was that upon my assignment, first, my fiduciary responsibilities as nominee were extinguished, and secondly, I had transferred and extinguished any and all liabilities under the subscription payable.</blockquote>This lack of consideration renders the acquisition by the Cojuangcos of the said PHI shares of no juridical effect.<br><br>It also appears that the transfer by these incorporators of their shares in favor of Cojuangco was made with the knowledge and consent of then Pres. Marcos.  As Gapud further averred in his deposition:<br><blockquote>VICE CONSUL HERNANDEZ: Can we note your objection and let Mr. Gapud answer.<br><br>So the aforesaid Deeds of Assignments obviously will be with the knowledge and upon authorization and order of former Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos, is this correct?<br><br>MR. GAPUD: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Considering that Prime Holdings, Inc. was incorporated upon the instructions of former President Marcos, obviously all the nominees would act only upon his authorization.  That's my answer.</span><br><br>VICE CONSUL HERNANDEZ:  So the deposition ends.</blockquote>Given the lack of consideration and the authority given by Pres. Marcos therefor, it would thus appear that the deeds of assignment executed by the PHI incorporators in favor of Ramon Cojuangco and his family were forged for the purpose of conveying management and control of PHI to the latter who likewise acted for and in behalf of Pres. Marcos.<br><br>In fine, the preponderance of evidence lies with the Republic insofar as the 111,415 shares in PTIC held by PHI are concerned.  Again, the evidence shows that PHI was organized for and in behalf of Pres. Marcos.  Thus, the 111,415 shares in PTIC, and necessarily the corresponding shares in PLDT, held by PHI must be reconveyed to the Republic as part of the Marcoses' ill-gotten wealth.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCORDINGLY,</span> I vote to grant the petition in G.R.

Very much later, however, Mrs. Marcos, by motion dated January 22, 1999, sought leave to amend answer for the purpose of pursuing a cross-claim against  Cojuangcos/PHI.  The respondent court, however, denied her motion, holding that the proferred Amended Answer with Cross-Claim thus attached to her motion varied her theory of defense, in that, while she asserted in her original answer that the late Pres. Marcos had lawfully acquired and thus owned the PLDT shares in question, she, in the intended amended answer with cross-claim, traversed the allegations of the Republic's Amended Complaint by pleading lack of knowledge of facts sufficient to form a belief as to the truth thereof.  Nonetheless, the respondent court allowed Mrs. Marcos to file a pleading to contain her cross-claim against Cojuangcos/PHI.<br><br>Accordingly, Mrs. Marcos filed a Cross-Claim dated April 21, 1999 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> against  Cojuangcos/PHI, alleging, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia, </span>the following:<br><blockquote>2.

Sometime in 1977, defendants Ramon Cojuangco and Imelda Cojuangco likewise acquired for and in behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Marcos and their family approximately . . .

For this purpose, PHI was organized with the following as incorporators [Jose D. Campos, Rolando C. Gapud, Renato E. Lirio, Gervaso T. Gaviola and Ernesto S.

Owing to the voluminous records she had to identify and testify on, the respondent court  ordered  that Magno's  testimony be taken before the Executive Clerk of Court on three trial dates to end on  September  5, 2000.<br><br>On September 5, 2000, the respondent court scheduled four (4) hearings for the remaining days of the month of September 2000.<br><br>However, the first three (3) settings, i.e., September 13, 18 and 20, 2000, were, upon petitioner Republic's written motion dated September 11, 2000, and for reasons ranging from its inability to locate a misplaced deposition to affording  the new assigned Solicitor time to go over the case records, cancelled.<br><br>Despite the developments immediately adverted to above, the parties and their counsels nonetheless appeared for the September 18, 2000 hearing. There, Atty. Taningco of the  PCGG manifested that the Government panel is in the process of  compiling the records to support the Republic's motion for admission, which,  in turn,  would serve as his basis for  recommending the filing of a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the respondent court, in a bid to expedite an early case disposition, then blocked off the following  dates for the presentation of evidence: For petitioner <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Republic</span>,   December 5, 2000, January 29, 30 and 31, February 1 and 2, 2001; and for respondents <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Cojuangcos/PHI,</span> March 12, 13, 14, 15, 26, 27 and 28, 2001.<br><br>What transpired next were the following events:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> The scheduled hearing  on December 5, 2000 was cancelled because the Republic's witness was not available.<br><br></li><li> Petitioner Republic filed a motion to reset the January 29, 30 and 31, 2001 hearings,   its Special Counsel having just received his assignment order for Civil Case No. 0002.<br><br></li><li> On January 29, 2001, petitioner Republic manifested its intention to call Mrs.  Marcos on the witness stand,  but requested for additional hearing dates, pleading  that it will not be ready to present Mrs. Marcos  within its allotted time. Respondents Cojuangcos/ PHI offered to stipulate on the testimony of the Republic's intended witness, one Atty. Manuel G. Montecillo.<br><br></li><li> Respondent court cancelled the January 29, 2001 hearing and required the parties to make an appearance at the next scheduled hearing, January 30, 2001, as previously set.<br><br></li><li> The January 30, 2001 schedule was cancelled, as requested by petitioner Republic, owing to lack of witness. In addition, the same petitioner  also asked for the cancellation of the three (3) succeeding scheduled hearings, i.e., January 31, February 1 and   2, 2001, and instead requested for a February 9, 2001 setting, undertaking to present Mrs. Marcos on that date, then rest its case, with or without  her testimony.<br><br></li><li> The February 9, 2001 setting was  reset, owing  to the unavailability on that day of the Republic's intended witness, Mrs. Marcos,  who, Atty. Evangelista of PCGG explained, was physically indisposed. Acting on the Republic's  request for a month  to present Mrs. Marcos, the   respondent court  granted the desired resetting to March 12, 13, 14 and 15, 2001, on the condition that the  Republic will have to rest its case with or without her  testimony.<br><br></li><li> On  March 12, 2001,  the  Republic  requested to reset the  scheduled  hearing.  Respondent court gave the Republic another opportunity to present its evidence and  accordingly reset the hearings  to March 26, 27, and 28, 2001, as previously scheduled.<br><br></li><li> On March 26, 2001, the Republic presented Lourdes Magno, the PCGG record custodian. Her direct, cross and redirect examinations were done that day. Ms. Magno was followed on March 27, 2001, by Rosalie Sarthou of the BIR. Respondents Cojuangcos/PHI manifested that the Republic had until the next trial date to finish its presentation of evidence.<br><br></li><li> After the parties, in the March 28, 2001 hearing, were through with Ms. Sarthou,  the Republic requested and was granted five additional trial dates, i.e.,  May 7, 9, 16, 28, and 30, 2001,  for the presentation of further evidence.<br><br></li><li> The hearing on May 7, 2001 was cancelled and reset to May 9, 2001. On May 9, 2001,  Republic presented Mr. Danilo Daniel, a PCGG Director, after which the presentation of further evidence was continued to May 28, and 30, 2001.</li></ol></blockquote>It is upon the foregoing factual backdrop that the respondent court issued, in the  May 28, 2001 hearing, its Order of even date  directing petitioner Republic to terminate the presentation of its evidence on the hearing of May 30, 2001.  The May 28, 2000 Order is, as earlier stated, what moved petitioner Republic to file its <span style="font-style: italic;">"Respectful Motion for Additional Time To Complete Presentation Of Evidence".</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, pending resolution of G.R.

On May 15, 2001, however, they filed amended notices re-scheduling the deposition taking of Attys. De Guzman and Mercado-Ferrer for May 31, 2001 and  June 1, 2001, respectively. The Yuchengcos would later request another  rescheduling and issuance of the corresponding subpoenas for the June 11 and 12, 2001 deposition taking of both individuals. The deposition taking of Atty. De Guzman proceeded  as scheduled â€“ and was completed - on June 12, 2001.  The scheduled deposition taking of Atty.

Both motions were denied in open court.  The parties thereupon agreed on their trial dates.  The dispositive portion of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">July 12, 2001 Pre-Trial Order </span>reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, with this Pretrial Order, the pretrial stage of this case with respect to plaintiff-in-intervention Y Realty Corporation is hereby terminated.<br><br>As agreed upon by all the parties, let the trial on the merits be set on July 26 and 30, 2001 for the reception of evidence for said plaintiff-intervenor, and on August 7, 29, 2001 and September 5 and 12, 2001 for the turn of the defendants-intervenors to present their evidence.  <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote>At the initial scheduled hearing on July 26, 2001 for the presentation of their evidence as plaintiffs-in-intervention, the Yuchengcos were unable to present  any witness to testify on their behalf. Likewise, on July 30, 2001, the Yuchengcos manifested that the subpoenaed Atty. de Guzman and Atty. Mercado-Ferrer were not in court. This development prompted respondents Cojuangcos/PHI to counter-manifest that De Guzman's and Mercado-Ferrer's testimonies need not be taken anymore, both having already been deposed and subjected to cross-examination, for which reason  they (Cojuangcos/ PHI) have waived their right to cross-examine.<br><br>At the next hearing session  â€“ August 7, 2001 -  the Yuchengcos again moved for the cancellation and resetting of the hearing on the ground that the witness  they  intended to present  on that day â€“ one Nene Trajano -  was unavailable. The respondent court denied the motion to cancel, and, in an open court order, deemed the Yuchengcos as having waived their right to present evidence, rationalizing as follows:<br><blockquote>When this case was called for hearing today,  Atty. Laurence Arroyo appeared for the plaintiffs-in-intervention, . . ., and moved for the cancellation of today's hearing as his . . . witnesses are not present in Court.<br><br>The Court reminded the plaintiffs-in-intervention that precisely the parties agreed on the trial dates for them to present and terminate the presentation of their respective evidence, i.e., the hearings for plaintiffs-in-intervention were set on July 26, 30, and August 7, 2001 and for defendants-in-intervention on August 29, September 5 and 12.

THE  COURT'S  RULING</span><br></div><br>As a matter of sound and long appellate practice, the Court, before considering the merits of a petition before it, looks into the matter of timeliness  and accordingly would dismiss or otherwise deny further due course to petitions for non-compliance with the jurisdictional caveat on timeliness of filing.  The threshold question, therefore, is whether or not all the five (5) petitions at bar were timely filed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lateness and Mootness</span> of the Petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R.

No. 149802</span> was filed out of time.  As it were, there can hardly be any quibbling that the Resolution of May 24, 2001 assailed thereby is interlocutory in character. For, respondent court's refusal to suspend trial until the Yuchengcos shall have  completed  their  discovery  did not terminate the case.  Further proceedings were still required, such as the further reception of evidence for all parties, inclusive of the Yuchengcos. In his <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span>  in   <span style="font-style: italic;">Investments,  Inc.  vs.  Court of Appeals,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  then Justice and   later  Chief  Justice  Andres  Narvasa   explained the nature of an  interlocutory  order   and how it differs with one that is final:<br><blockquote>The concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">"final judgment"</span>, as distinguished from one which has "become final" (or "executory" as of right [final and executory]), is definite and settled.  A "final" judgment or order is one that finally disposes of a case, leaving nothing more to be done by the Court in respect thereto, e.g., an adjudication on the merits which, on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial, declares categorically what the rights and obligations of the parties are and which party is in the right; or a judgment or order that dismisses an action on the ground, for instance, of res judicata or prescription.  Once rendered, the task of the Court is ended, as far as deciding the controversy or determining the rights and liabilities of the litigants is concerned.  Nothing more remains to be done by the Court except to await the parties' next move . . . and ultimately, of course, to cause the execution of the judgment once it becomes <span style="font-style: italic;">"final"</span> or, to use the established and more distinctive term, <span style="font-style: italic;">"final and executory".</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx       xxx       xxx<br></div><br>Conversely, an order that does not finally dispose of the case, and does not end the Court's task of adjudicating the parties' contentions and determining their rights and liabilities as regards each other, but obviously indicates that other things remain to be done by the Court, is "interlocutory", e.g., an order denying a motion to dismiss under Rule 16 of the Rules, . . . .   Unlike a <span style="font-style: italic;">"final"</span> judgment or order, which is appealable, as above pointed out, an "interlocutory" order may not be questioned on appeal except only as part of an appeal that may eventually be taken from the final judgment rendered in the case. (at pp. 339-340)</blockquote>Following <span style="font-style: italic;">Investments, Inc.</span>,  the remedy of an appeal from the interlocutory May 24, 2001 Order was unavailing to  the Yuchengcos, thus the propriety of  their coming  to this Court, with respect to that order, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 149802</span> via a special action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the  Rules of the Court.<br><br>It may be recalled, however, that prior to the  filing of their petition in G.R. No. 149802, the Yuchengcos first urged the respondent court for a reconsideration of  its <span style="font-weight: bold;">May 24, 2001 Resolution,</span> a copy of which they received, by their own admission, on June 7, 2001. The corresponding motion filed on <span style="font-weight: bold;">August 15, 2001</span> also sought the reconsideration of the open-court <span style="font-weight: bold;">Order dated July 12, 2001</span>.  Given these defining dates, there is a need to look into the timeliness of the said motion as a preliminary step  to determine the timeliness of the Yuchengcos' petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 149802</span> itself.<br><br>The rule on the filing of petitions for certiorari is embodied in Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, partly reading -<br><blockquote>SEC. 4.  <span style="font-style: italic;">When and where petition filed</span>. â€“ The petition may be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution.  In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not, the sixty (60) day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of said motion.  <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote>As the rule now thus stands,  the 60-day reglementary period within which to file a petition for certiorari shall be reckoned from notice of the  resolution or order sought to be nullified, save when a motion for reconsideration is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">timely filed</span> in which case the 60-day period shall start from receipt of the denial of such motion.<br><br>A corollary rule,  subsumed in the same Section 4 of Rule 65, applies  in the event it is determined that a motion for reconsideration is not timely. In such a situation, a party seeking to avail himself of the remedy of certiorari under the same Rule 65, does not have a new 60-day period from receipt of the denial of the motion for reconsideration, within which to file the petition.  As such, the timeliness  of the petition must be reckoned from the date of notice or receipt of the  order or resolution assailed, as if no motion for reconsideration was filed.<br><br>Given the following sequence of events: a copy of the May 24, 2001 resolution was received on June 7; the motion for reconsideration thereof was filed on August 15, with a copy of the resolving issuance  dated September 5 received on September 18, the question that now  comes to fore is:  <span style="font-style: italic;">Vis-a-vis</span> the May 24, 2001 resolution, was the motion for its reconsideration filed on August 15, 2001 timely, so that the Yuchengcos can validly reckon, as they in fact did, the  60-day period from their receipt on September 18, 2001 of the September 5, 2001 Resolution denying  reconsideration of the Resolution of May 24, 2001 jointly with the Order of July 12, 2001?<br><br>To answer the poser, a determination  must first be made as to when should a motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order  be filed.  <span style="font-style: italic;">In Denso (Phils.), Inc. vs. The Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court ruled that a motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order is not subject to the usual limiting fifteen-day period of appeal prescribed for final judgments or orders. The Denso ruling, however, stopped short of directly addressing the issue of  precisely when should a party file a motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order. For, apart from saying that such motion  is not subject to the 15-day-appeal-period rule, it merely held  that moving for reconsideration after the  lapse of  a 38-day period after receipt of the assailed order is not unreasonable.<br><br>While the Rules of Court has no specific provision dealing directly with  the question,  Section 4 of Rule 65  provides a logical answer.<br><br>Taken in its proper perspective, the clause "not subject to the limiting 15-day period for appeal prescribed for final judgments or orders" cannot plausibly be stretched to mean that the period to ask for reconsideration of an interlocutory order can exceed the 60-day threshold prescribed under the Section 4 of Rule 65 for filing a petition for certiorari. Else, a legal aberration would ensue where a party who has merely 60 days from notice of an adverse interlocutory order to interpose a special action for certiorari would be allowed a longer period to move for reconsideration of such order.<br><br>Withal,  the filing of the Yuchengcos' motion for reconsideration of the Resolution of May 24, 2001 on August 15, 2001, which is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">69</span><sup style="font-weight: bold;">th</sup><span style="font-weight: bold;"> day</span> from notice of the said Resolution on June 7, 2001, is beyond the 60-day period prescribed under the present Section 4 of Rule 65, and is, therefore, late.  Perforce, and as discussed earlier, their petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 149802</span> itself was belatedly filed.  In fine, for lack of a timely motion for reconsideration of the May 24, 2001 Resolution, the same has, in a manner of speaking, thereby become final and executory. Certiorari, insofar as the said resolution is concerned, is no longer available.<br><br>Apropos the Order of July 12, 2001, this Court is of the view that the same petition in G.R. No. 149802  has, with respect to such order, become  moot and academic.  As we look back at the incidents subject of the stated order, the Yuchengcos had moved that the  trial  be suspended  to await the completion of their discovery procedure or, in the alternative, for respondents Cojuangcos/PHI to present their evidence, vis-Ã¡-vis the claim of petitioner Republic, ahead of them (Yuchengcos). By this desired variation of the order of trial, the Yuchengcos were, as we see it, actually hoping to be given additional trial dates for presentation of evidence on top of those  dates  allotted them but did not utilize.  Owing, however, to the promulgation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span> dated April 25, 2002, we can assume that during the pendency of the petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 149802,</span> petitioner Republic and respondent Cojuangcos/PHI had, in the separate trial on the PLDT shares, already finished with the presentation of their evidence and have rested their case, the latter in relation to both the Republic's Amended Complaint and the Yuchengcos' Complaint-in-Intervention.  In net effect, the change in the order of presentation of evidence veritably sought in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 149802</span> can no longer be granted, or, if granted, can no longer be implemented.  It is, therefore, futile to belabor, let alone rule, on the merits of this particular petition insofar as it relates to the Order of <span style="font-weight: bold;">July 12, 2001</span>.  Time and again, we have said that courts exist to decide actual controversies, and do not render opinions on moot cases.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Due Process Issue</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> in</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">G.R. NOS. 150320 and 150367</span><br><br>The Court shall first pass upon   the issue of due process, or lack of it, to be precise, uniformly invoked in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 150320</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">150367</span>.  If non-observance  of the requirements of due process indeed tainted the separate trial  below,   then the resolution on  the issue of the substantive correctness of the Partial Decision  raised in petitions for review in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 153459</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 153207</span> should be clear,  simple and unavoidable. For, a judgment arrived at after a trial marred by lack of due process deserves to be immediately struck down as a nullity.<br><br>It may be well to revisit  the various issuances sought to be annulled  under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court  on due procedural ground. Specifically, petitioner Republic assails, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No.150367</span>, the respondent court's <span style="font-weight: bold;">Order dated May 30, 2001</span>  denying its motion for additional time to present its evidence, as well as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Order dated September 5, 2001</span> requiring the same petitioner to file and terminate its formal offer of evidence within 30 days.  On the other hand, in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150320</span>, the Yuchengcos urge the annulment of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">August 7, 2001</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">September 28, 2001 Resolutions</span> in which they were deemed by the  respondent court to have waived their right to present further evidence.  At bottom, respondent court issued these assailed orders and/or resolutions owing to both petitioners' failure to complete the presentation of their respective evidence within the agreed trial dates, a failure which, if allowed to continue, would, in the eyes of that court, further derail the early disposition of Civil Case No. 0002.  It could have been that the respondent court was, in the end, actuated by the desire to resolve a case that has been pending for the last fourteen (14) years. And this, in hindsight, is not an idle speculation on our part as respondent court would later write in its <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> citing Republic vs. Sandiganbayan,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the following:<br><blockquote>We stress that the resolution of the complaint-in-intervention, along with the principal case, is long overdue. What the Supreme Court has said in this regard four years ago has acquired even greater urgency today â€“<br><blockquote>'xxx Eleven years have passed since the government started its search for and reversion of such alleged ill-gotten wealth. The definitive resolution of such cases on the merits is thus long overdue. If there is adequate proof of illegal acquisition, accumulation, misappropriation, fraud or illicit conduct, let it be brought now . . ."<br></blockquote></blockquote>It cannot be gainsaid that the respondent court merely exercised its discretion to order â€“ and to be guided by such order - the termination of the respective presentation of evidence by both  petitioners Yuchengcos and Republic  or to set a limiting timetable for such presentation. We are loathe to disturb such exercise of judicial discretion which has spawned the petitions for certiorari in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150320</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150367</span>. For, jurisprudence teaches that certiorari lies only when the tribunal acts without or oversteps its jurisdiction, or gravely abuses its discretion,  <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> as when  the power is exercised  in  an  arbitrary  or  despotic  manner by reason of passion, prejudice or personal hostility. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The abuse must, in fine, be of such degree  as to amount to an evasion of positive duty, or  a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined, or to act at all, in contemplation of law, as to be equivalent to having acted without jurisdiction. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>What we said in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee, et al. vs. People</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> is  also apropos, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.:</span><br><blockquote>xxx Certiorari may not be availed of where it is not shown that the respondent court lacked or exceeded its jurisdiction over the case even if its findings are not correct.<br><br>In other words, certiorari will issue only to correct errors or jurisdiction and not to correct errors of procedure or mistakes in the court's findings and conclusions.  An interlocutory order may be assailed by certiorari only when it is shown that the court acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.  However, this Court generally frowns upon this remedial measure as regards interlocutory orders.  To tolerate the practice of allowing interlocutory orders to be the subject of review by certiorari will not only delay the administration of justice but will also unduly burden the courts. (At pp. 402-03)</blockquote>Complementing <span style="font-style: italic;">Lee </span>is <span style="font-style: italic;">Ampeloquio, Sr.  vs. Court of Appeals</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> where we wrote:<br><blockquote>xxx  If every error committed by the trial court were to be a proper object of review by certiorari, the trial would never come to an end and the appellate courts' dockets would be clogged <span style="font-style: italic;">ad infinitum</span> with the aggrieved parties-litigants filing petitions against every interlocutory order of the trial court.  Such a situation could only undermine the proper conduct of litigation before the courts and ought not to be tolerated if we are to enhance the prompt administration of justice at every level of the judicial hierarchy.</blockquote>In the light of the foregoing doctrinal holdings, we can say without fear of contradiction that not every erroneous interlocutory order, if that be the case, is correctible by certiorari. We grant  certiorari only upon clear showing that the trial court issued its challenged  interlocutory order without or in excess of jurisdiction or in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. Conversely, absent the vitiating element of want or excess of jurisdiction, certiorari is unavailing as a remedy.<br><br>We thus sustain as defensible, nay correct, under the obtaining factual milieu and certainly within the jurisdiction of the respondent court, the issuance of the assailed orders and resolutions respecting the presentation of evidence.  As it were, petitioners Republic's and Yuchengcos' respective certiorari petitions basically rest on the postulate that the respondent court violated their right to due process of law when it refused to grant them what basically were requests for further postponements  to further receive their respective evidence.<br><br>Lest it be overlooked, the matter of granting or denying a plea for continuance or postponement is, as a rule, addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  In 1916, or some eighty nine (89) years ago, the landmark case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Lino- Luna vs. Arcenas, </span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  expounded on the juridical concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">"discretion"</span> in the following wise:<br><blockquote>In its very nature, the discretionary control conferred upon the trial judge over the proceedings had before him implies the absence of any hard-and-fast rule by which it is to be exercised, and in accordance with which it may be reviewed.  But the discretion conferred upon the courts is not a willful, arbitrary, capricious and uncontrolled discretion.  It is a sound, judicial discretion which should always be exercised with due regard to the rights of the parties and the demands of equity and justice.  As was said in the case of The Styria vs. Morgan (186 U.S., 1, 9): "The establishment of a clearly defined rule of action would be the end of discretion, and yet discretion should not be a word for arbitrary will or inconsiderate action."  So in the case of Goodwin vs. Prime (92 Me., 355), it was said that "discretion implies that in the absence of positive law or fixed rule the judge is to decide by his view of expediency or by the demands of equity and justice."<br><br>There being no "positive law or fixed rule" to guide the judge in the court below in such cases, there is no "positive law or fixed rule" to guide a court of appeal in reviewing his action in the premises, and such courts will not therefore attempt to control the exercise of discretion by the court below unless it plainly appears that there was "inconsiderate action" or the exercise of mere "arbitrary will," or in other words that his action in the premises amounted to "an abuse of discretion."  But the right of an appellate court to review judicial acts which lie in the discretion of inferior courts may properly be invoked upon a showing of a strong and clear case of abuse of power to the prejudice of the appellant, or that the ruling objected to rested on an erroneous principle of law not vested in discretion.<br><br>The doctrine, supported by numerous citations of authority, is thus stated in the Encyclopedia of Pleading and Practice (vol. 2, pp. 416, 418):<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Abuse of discretion</span>. -   Accordingly, where the power is so exercised as to deprive a party of a legal right, or unduly benefit one party at the expense of the other, or where, generally, the injustice or inexpediency of the act is so clear as to show beyond a reasonable doubt the violation of equitable considerations, the act of decision is always reviewable in some form on appeal, as an abuse of power.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Presumption.</span> -  The presumption on appeal that the exercise of discretionary powers was sound is very strong.  The appellant must rebut it by showing a strong and clear case of abuse of power to his prejudice, or that the decision below rested on an erroneous principle of law not vested in discretion.  A mere mistake of judgment, or a difference in opinion between the appellate and the trial court, is not sufficient."</blockquote>It cannot be stressed enough that postponements have a way of causing delays of the vexatious kind. With this in mind and with respect to the specific issue  before us,  we are now confronted with the  task of harmonizing two (2) basic, but not necessarily irreconcilable, rights etched no less in the Bill of Rights.  We refer to the right to due process, on one hand, and the right to speedy trial, on the other. This undertaking becomes all the more made difficult by the stark reality that these petitions involve <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth"</span> reputedly amassed by the Marcos family, their friends and former business associates where, as in several like cases, the Court itself dictated a resolution in <span style="font-style: italic;">"utmost dispatch"</span>, albeit acknowledging in the same breath that <span style="font-style: italic;">"over and above the exigencies of recovering ill-gotten wealth, we must carry out the more pressing constitutional task of seeing to it that all parties are afforded due processes and substantial justice"</span>, stressing that this burden extends <span style="font-style: italic;">"[E]ven to those suspected . . . of having acquired and/or accumulated ill-gotten wealth..."</span>  <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>It is, therefore, well-nigh apropos to hark on judicial precedents on the two constitutional rights adverted to above.<br><br>In the abstract <span style="font-style: italic;">"due process"</span> has been described as nothing more and nothing less than "the embodiment of the sporting idea of fair play." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Its irreducible minimum requirements are notice and hearing, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  the right to be heard being its most basic tenet. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  In <span style="font-style: italic;">PCIB  vs. Court of Appeals,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> we held that the essence of due process is that a party is afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard in support  of his case; what the law abhors and prohibits is the absolute absence of the opportunity to be heard.  Hence, a party cannot feign denial of due process when, having  been afforded the opportunity to present his side, chooses, for whatever reason, not to be heard. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the right to speedy trial, as an adjunct to the right of all persons to a speedy disposition of their cases before  judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies, requires that court proceedings should be conducted according to fixed rules and must be free from vexatious, capricious and oppressive delays. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  In the determination of whether or not the right to speedy trial  has been violated, the factors that may be considered and balanced are length of delay, reason for the delay, assertion of the right or failure to assert it, and prejudice to counsel by the delay. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing perspective, it was in keeping with the imperatives of speedy trial for the respondent court, in the exercise of its discretion, to issue the orders/resolutions assailed in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150320</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150367</span> as a necessary consequence to its denial of petitioners' innumerable motions for postponement.<br><br>An old but still good decisional law holds that the postponement of the hearing of a case, which had been previously set with due notice to the parties and their attorneys, is not an absolute right of the litigants nor of their counsel. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Owing, however, to the practice that persists to this day, we acknowledged the stubborn reality that continuances and postponements form part of the procedural system of dispensing justice. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  But even so, the Court has already taken measures to cleanse the system of this practice which, when abused, as it has often been abused, leads to <span style="font-style: italic;">"the wheels of justice grinding to a halt".</span>  One reformative step is the mandatory continuous trial scheme prescribed under Supreme Court (SC) Administrative Order No.4, series of 1988, in relation to SC Circular No. 1-89. Under this scheme, <span style="font-style: italic;">"trials are to be held on the scheduled dates without needless postponements, the factual issues for trial well defined at pre-trial and the whole proceedings terminated and ready for judgment within ninety (90) days  from the date  of the initial hearing, unless, for meritorious reasons, an extension is permitted"</span>. Following a trial period involving the participation of designated pilot courts, the Court issued Administrative Circular (AC)  No. 3-90, series of 1990, decreeing the adoption of the mandatory continuous trial system  starting February 15, 1990, in all trial courts.<br><br>Not to be overlooked as another measure towards a speedy disposition of cases is the issuance of SC Administrative Circular No. 3-99 prescribing  guidelines on effective management of cases to ensure their speedy disposition. Some highlights:<br><blockquote>B. <span style="font-style: italic;">Trial</span><br><br>(5) The judge shall conduct trial with utmost dispatch, with judicious exercise of the court's power to control trial proceedings to avoid delay.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx       xxx       xxx<br></div><br>(7) The trial shall be terminated within ninety (90) days from initial hearing.  Appropriate disciplinary sanctions may be imposed on the judge and the lawyers for failure to comply with this requirement due to causes attributable to them.<br><br>(8) Each party is bound to complete the presentation of his evidence within the trial dates assigned to him.  After the lapse of said dates, the party is deemed to have completed the presentation of evidence.  However, upon verified motion based on compelling reasons, the judge may allow a party additional trial dates in the afternoon; provided that said extension will not go beyond the three-month limit computed from the first trial date except when authorized in writing by the Court Administrator, Supreme Court.</blockquote>It is thus abundantly clear that the mandatory continuous trial scheme, the guidelines on trial, and, to a significant level, the ideal articulated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic (PCGG) vs. Sandiganbayan</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>  to resolve <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth cases"</span> with utmost dispatch, circumscribed, in a way,  the respondent court's otherwise  wide latitude in the conduct of its proceedings. At bottom, then, respondent court acted with some degree of circumspection and, doubtless, well within its authority when, in its assailed issuances in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 150367</span>, it refused to accommodate petitioner Republic with additional trial dates  and ordered it to file its formal offer of exhibits and rest its case. The same conclusion applies to petitioner Yuchengcos in<span style="font-weight: bold;"> G.R. No. 150320</span>. Grave abuse of discretion cannot be ascribed on the respondent court in (i) proceeding to hear the evidence of  the Yuchengcos on the agreed trial dates of July 26 and 30 and August 7, 2001, (ii) refusing to reset the hearings to later dates, and (iii) declaring them to have effectively waived their right to present further evidence when they were still without evidence or witness on the last trial date.  There is hardly any dispute that these were trial dates previously agreed upon and to which the Yuchengcos committed to abide. And under the cited Guidelines on Trial, petitioner Yuchengcos were bound to complete the presentation of their evidence within the trial dates assigned to them.  Likewise, at the end of the trial dates, they were deemed to have completed with the presentation of their evidence.  It would be an aberration for the Court to fault and reverse the graft court for following what it has enjoined the latter to observe in the first place.<br><br>As to petitioner Republic, it was given, per our own count, no less than  twenty (20) trial dates. There were, in fact, more trial settings than those agreed upon and directed in the pre-trial of May 25, 2000. The accommodating attitude of the graft court towards petitioner Republic did not escape petitioner Yuchengcos' notice. While perhaps a bit exaggerated, petitioner Yuchengcos statement in page 88 of their <span style="font-style: italic;">"Consolidated Memorandum" </span> that <span style="font-style: italic;">"not once did [the Sandiganbayan]  deny their (Republic's) requests to cancel scheduled hearings"</span> belies the Republic's lament that the respondent court did not accord  it <span style="font-style: italic;">"fair, adequate and reasonable opportunity to present all evidence they consider vital".</span><br><br>The problem lies not in the alleged unreasonable refusal of the respondent court to grant the  Republic more trial dates, but, as the respondent court aptly suggested, in the  Republic's innumerable requests for cancellation and resetting of hearings, on one pretext after another, which, at the end of the day,  reflected on the unpreparedness of its  set of counsels and the seeming  unavailability of admissible material evidence. With the view we take of the case, petitioner Republic sought, but in vain, to present respondent Mrs. Marcos, it being its posture that her testimony - after she had  announced to the four winds that the  Marcos family  owns the disputed PLDT shares in the name of respondent Cojuangcos/PHI - would have been vital to its case. Ironical as it may sound, petitioner Republic seems to imply by its consuming bid to have Mrs. Marcos on the witness stand that it cannot adequately prove its case without her testimony. For, how else explain the fact that it footnoted its Formal Offer of Evidence with the reservation to have her testify, if  so allowed by this Court?<br><br>To be sure, we have taken note of petitioner Republic's assertion that respondent court  gave its  word during the March 26, 2001 hearing that it can present Mrs. Marcos  after all of its intended witnesses shall have testified.  This assurance, if indeed given, cannot be taken to mean, however, that the court has to forever await her testimony. The refusal to grant petitioner Republic additional trial dates just to have the unwilling Mrs. Marcos testify is understandable, when taken in the perspective of vexatious delays juxtaposed with the Republic's counsel's commitment given in one of the hearings to finish with the presentation of evidence with or without her testimony.  As we refer to the records, we see that the first time petitioner Republic manifested its intention to present Mrs. Marcos as its hostile witness was during the hearing of January 29, 2001. But the succeeding scheduled hearing dates, i.e,  January 30 and 31, 2001,  February 1, 2, and  9, March 12, 13, 14, 15, 26, 27, and 28, May 7, 9, 16 and 28, 2001 came and went without Mrs. Marcos testifying as a witness of petitioner Republic.  It is in fact not amiss to say that all these scheduled hearings were, at the instance of petitioner Republic, cancelled or reset to other dates, either because of the unavailability of the intended witness or the government handling counsel was ill prepared for  trial.<br><br>The Yuchengcos were no better. They agreed to present their evidence on certain trial dates, but were unable to do so in any of those trial dates, inclusive of the last scheduled hearing.  In any event, the depositions of Attys. de Guzman and Mercado-Ferrer, together with that of Gregorio Romulo, were received in evidence for said petitioners over the objections of the adverse parties.  Moreover, petitioner Yuchengcos wasted their trial dates by their unyielding insistence on presenting witnesses who have already been deposed, and even after respondents Cojuangcos/PHI anticipatorily manifested their intention to waive their right to further cross-examine the deponents. While perhaps a bit anti-climactic to state at this juncture,  there was no attempt to present petitioner Yuchengco himself, when it would seem that he was in the best of position to testify on his and/or Y Realty Corporation's claim over the PTIC and PLDT shares or on the alleged duress exerted on him by the Marcoses or the Cojuangco group.<br><br>Neither do we find persuasive cogency in the Yuchengcos' posture that the separate trial should have been suspended to await the completion of their discovery  efforts.  For, such arrangement, if allowed and put in motion, would have veritably provided said petitioners with tools to cause the indefinite suspension of the separate trial by the convenient plea of inadequate availment of discovery.  Besides, we are at loss to understand the Yuchengcos' contention about their inability to undertake  discovery procedure until this Court reinstated their Amended Complaint-in-Intervention heretofore dismissed by the respondent court.  There is no rule, and the Yuchengcos have cited none â€“ precluding them from  undertaking such discovery procedure prior to the reinstatement action of this Court.  Neither is there any rule requiring the suspension of trial just to allow a party-litigant to complete  discovery procedure.<br><br>And, when we take into stock   of respondent court's constant  reminders  to  the contending parties to observe the trial schedule in view of the length of time that Civil Case No. 0002 has been pending, petitioners Republic and Yuchengcos have, in the final reckoning,  only themselves to point at for their present plight.  The recorded facts indicate that they were not denied the opportunity to be heard.<br><br>Finally, we cannot write <span style="font-style: italic;">finis</span> to the due process issue without resolving the  question of whether the respondent court, through the use of its coercive powers, could have had compelled Mrs. Marcos to be petitioner Republic's  hostile witness and testify on the circumstances surrounding their  (the Marcos family) claimed acquisition and ownership of the disputed PLDT and PTIC shares.<br><br>The Court only has to recall that when Mrs. Marcos refused to make a court appearance for petitioner Republic, she invoked  her right against self-incrimination under Article III, Section 17 of the Constitution. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>   She was correct.  She cannot be compelled to testify without violating her constitutional right against self-incrimination. As she aptly observed, Civil Case No. 0002, while basically a civil suit, is penal in nature, since it is, for all intents and purposes, a forfeiture proceeding, taken under and pursuant to EO Nos. 1 and 2, series of 1986. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>   These twin issuances indeed seek, as ultimate objective, the <span style="font-style: italic;">"recovery of all ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates",</span>  and the properties being contemplated to be recovered being those<span style="font-style: italic;"> "funds, moneys, assets and properties illegally acquired or misappropriated"</span> by said persons â€“ thus, stamping upon the civil suit the characteristics of a forfeiture proceedings.<br><br>The suggestion that the right against compulsory self-incrimination may be invoked only in criminal proceedings is valid to a certain extent, but not enough justification to compel Mrs. Marcos to testify  against her volition, given the penal characteristics of Civil Case No. 0002.  This is because Rule 115, Section 1(e) of the Rules of Court accords the accused at a trial  the right <span style="font-style: italic;">"to be exempt from being compelled to be witness against himself "</span>. The kernel of this privilege is testimonial compulsion, or simply a prohibition against legal process to extract from a person's own lips an admission of guilt  against his will. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>   As  this Court has further explained in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Ayson</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> -<br><blockquote>The right of a defendant in a criminal case (to be exempt from being a witness against himself) signifies that he cannot be compelled to testify or produce evidence in the criminal cases in which he is the accused, or one of the accused.  He cannot be compelled to do <span style="font-style: italic;">so even by subpoena</span> or other process or order of the Court.  He cannot be required to be a witness either for the prosecution, or for a co-accused, or even for himself.  In other words â€“ unlike an ordinary witness (or a party in a civil action) who may be compelled to testify by subpoena, having only the right to refuse to answer a particular incriminatory question at the time it is put to him â€“ <span style="font-style: italic;">the defendant in a criminal action can refuse to testify altogether.  He can refuse to take the witness stand, be sworn, answer any question. </span> And, as the law categorically states, his neglect or refusal to be a witness shall not in any manner prejudice or be used against him. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Lest we be misunderstood, this  Court's  concurrence with Mrs. Marcos is really nothing more than being faithful with what was taught in the oft-cited case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cabal vs. Kapunan</span>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>In a strict signification, a forfeiture is a divestiture of property without compensation, in consequence of a default or an offense, and the term is used in such a sense in this article.  A forfeiture, as thus defined, is imposed by way of <span style="font-style: italic;">punishment</span> not by the mere convention of the parties, but by the lawmaking power, to insure a prescribed course of conduct.  It is a method deemed necessary by the legislature to restrain <span style="font-style: italic;">the commission of an offense and to aid in the prevention of such an offense</span>.  The effect of such a forfeiture is to transfer the title to the specific thing from the owner to the sovereign power. (23 Am. Jur. 599, italics in the original)<br><br>In Black's Law Dictionary a "forfeiture" is defined to be "the incurring of a liability to pay a definite sum of money as the consequence of violating the provisions of some statute or refusal to comply with some requirement of law".  It may be said to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">penalty</span> imposed for misconduct or breach of duty. (Com. vs. French, 114 S.W. 255)<br><br>As a consequence, proceedings for forfeiture of property are deemed criminal or penal, and, hence, the exemption of defendants in criminal cases from the obligation to be witnesses against themselves is applicable thereto.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx       xxx       xxx<br></div><br>The rule protecting a person from being compelled to furnish evidence which would incriminate him exists <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not only</span> when he is liable criminally to prosecution and punishment, but also when his answer would tend to expose him to a xxx forfeiture xxx."  (Am. Jur. Sec. 43, p. 48)  (Italics in the original)</blockquote>Assayed against the cited jurisprudence, respondent Mrs. Marcos can, as was her bent,  refuse to testify altogether, notwithstanding the express allegations she made in the pleadings adverted to by petitioner Republic.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The  Propriety of  <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY JUDGMENT</span> as</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Against the Yuchengcos' Second Amended Complaint-in-Intervention</span><br><br>Under Section 3, Rule 35, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment may be allowed where, save for the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  Summary or accelerated judgment is a procedural technique aimed at weeding out sham claims or defenses at an early stage of the litigation, thereby avoiding the expense and loss of time involved in a trial.  Even if the pleadings appear, on their face, to raise issues, summary judgment may still ensue as a matter of law if the affidavits, depositions and admissions show that such issues are not genuine. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>  The presence or absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact determines, at bottom,  the propriety of summary judgment.  A "genuine issue", as differentiated from a fictitious or contrived one,  is an issue of fact that requires the presentation of evidence.  To the  party who moves for summary judgment rests the onus  of demonstrating clearly the absence of any genuine issue of fact, or that the issue posed in the complaint is patently unsubstantial so as not to constitute a genuine issue for trial. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Guided by the principles above indicated, we hold that, under the circumstances obtaining, summary judgment is proper and  the respondent court did not commit a reversible error in granting the corresponding motion for summary judgment filed by respondents Cojuangcos/PHI on the Second Amended Complaint-in-Intervention.<br><br>As may be observed, petitioner Yuchengco anchored his claim  over the disputed PLDT shares on the proposition that the  Marcos regime coerced him into giving up 6% of PTIC shares formerly owned by Gregorio Romulo and Leonides Virata which he paid for. Apart from this 6% PTIC-share transaction,  he alleged having entered into a <span style="font-style: italic;">"put and call" </span>agreement with GTE for the purchase of the latter's 25% equity in PTIC, but that he was again coerced into not exercising his option to purchase, only to be apprised  later that PHI acquired the same 25% stockholdings.<br><br>It cannot be overemphasized, <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-Ã¡-vis</span> the Yuchengcos' claim that, when respondents Cojuangcos/PHI moved for summary judgment, the Yuchengcos, consequent to their having been deemed to have waived their right to present their evidence, were effectively precluded from pursuing discovery procedure. In net effect, the only facts before the respondent court at the time of the filing of the motion for summary judgment were those to be gathered from the pleadings and the depositions of Mr. Romulo and Attys. de Guzman and Mercado-Ferrer.<br><br>No substantial proof of coercion or duress, however, appears from the depositions on file.  On the other hand, the only relevant facts deducible from the deposition of Atty. Mercado-Ferrer on the <span style="font-style: italic;">"put and call"</span> option, are: (1) the  put option of petitioner Alfonso T. Yuchengco expired in 1972; and (2) petitioner Y Realty Corporation  executed a waiver of its pre-emptive right on the transfer of the PTIC shares held by GTE to Mr. Ramon U. Cojuangco in 1978.  Thus, if, by its own terms, the <span style="font-style: italic;">"put and call" </span>option expired in 1972,  Yuchengco's right had long lapsed when the assignment of the PTIC shares were made in favor of the late Ramon U. Cojuangco.  Moreover, the waiver Y Realty Corporation executed may be seen to confirm petitioner Yuchengco's assent to the aforesaid assignment of PTIC shares in favor of Ramon Cojuangco.<br><br>As to Mr. Gregorio D. Romulo, his deposition taken on August 3, 1987 yields the following:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"ATTY.

Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be based on personal knowledge of the declarant, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Therefore, in determining whether summary judgment is proper, statements contained in affidavits, which would be inadmissible in evidence (such as statements of opinion, belief and hearsay) must be disregarded. So it must be with the Romulo deposition.<br><br>One minor point. Petitioner Yuchengcos drew attention to  the pendency of their petitions in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. Nos. 149802</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">150320 </span>when the  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span> was rendered, suggesting doubtless that it was error on the part of the respondent court to proceed with the  separate trial below without awaiting the outcome of said petitions.<br><br>We are not persuaded. The pendency of the petitions in G.R. Nos. 149802 and 150320 did not, without more, dilute the validity of the assailed <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span> or diminish the authority of the respondent court to render the same. Section 7, Rule 65 of   the Rules of Court says as much:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Expediting proceedings; injunctive relief.</span> - The court in which the petition [for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus] is filed may issue orders expediting the proceedings, and it may also grant a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction for the preservation of the rights of the parties pending such proceedings. The petition shall not interrupt the course of the principal case unless a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction has been issued against the public respondent from further proceedings in the case.</blockquote>The governing rule, in fine,  is that to arrest the course of the principal action during the pendency of certiorari proceedings, there must be an interrupting restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction from the appellate court directed to the lower court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> There was none in the instant case. Accordingly, it was in order for the respondent court to proceed with the separate trial in Civil Case No. 0002 and necessarily in rendering a judgment, in this instance, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span>, which, in its estimation, is called for by the facts and law of the case.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSAL OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AGAINST COJUANGCOS/PHI</span><br><br>We now come what, to us, is the center of the controversy. We refer to the question of  whether or not  the disputed PLDT shares, which are covered by the equally disputed PTIC shares of respondents Cojuangcos/PHI, are indeed part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth"</span> of the Marcos family - <span style="font-style: italic;">ergo</span> to be  forfeited in favor of the State - using the evidentiary standards and determinative indicia set out in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bataan Shipyard &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. (Baseco) vs. PCGG,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and applied analogously in subsequent cases, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> whence the conclusion that the wealth is <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten"</span> may be reasonably deduced. Respondent court cited the benchmark outlined in Baseco in support of its <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>One, evidence indicating manifest partiality and favorable treatment by the former President towards the alleged trustees, as demonstrated by active interplay between him and such trustees and/or presidential interventions which have resulted in inexplicable benefits to the trustees or to the corporations held by him through such trustees; and<br><br>Two, the existence of documents and records in the possession of the former President which, through indorsements and/or assignment made thereon in blank by his trustees, provide the legal instrumentation for him to assert, now or in the future, ownership or control over the properties held by his trustees and/or to recover such properties from them. (At p. 23)</blockquote>The respondent court dismissed the Republic's Amended Complaint  as  against  the  Cojuangcos/ PHI  on  the  finding that the  former  has  not  adequately discharged its burden of proving, by the threshold preponderance of evidence required in "ill-gotten wealth" cases, that the subject PLDT shares are ill-gotten. Wrote the  respondent court:<br><blockquote>xxx the Republic has failed to provide such "proof of authenticity or reliability" of the documents offered by it in evidence. Thus almost all  the documents offered by the Republic are photocopies, and no effort was undertaken . . . to submit the originals of said documents, or to have them properly identified, or to otherwise justify the admission of mere photocopies. Not surprisingly, defendants . . . objected to the admission of the Republic's documentary exhibits, citing violation of the Best Evidence Rule (Section 3, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure ["Rules"], the Rules on Presentation of Documentary Evidence (Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules), the Hearsay Evidence Rule, and the rule as to Purpose/s of Documentary Evidence (Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules)." (at p. 31)</blockquote>Excepting, petitioner Republic tags the respondent court's  determinative finding  as a <span style="font-style: italic;">"sweeping conclusion" </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">"bare generalization"</span>. Pressing the point, petitioner Republic argues that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span> did not identify with particular specificity which evidence failed to hurdle the bar of admissibility for being <span style="font-style: italic;">"mere photocopies"</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">"are otherwise unidentified, unauthenticated, and constitutive of hearsay".</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Republic's lament is, to a point, well taken. Indeed, not all documents  the Republic offered in evidence in the separate trial on the PLDT shares suffer from the infirmity imputed on them by the graft court.  For, as argued with some measure of merit, most of these documentary  evidence have been identified and authenticated during the deposition taking of the deponents whose depositions were entered into evidence after  the usual procedure of comparing the originals with the faithful reproductions thereof which were those marked in evidence.  And certainly not lost on this Court is the fact that some documents are common exhibits, thus, there exists no tenable reason for any of the parties offering them as common exhibits  to object to their admissibility.<br><br>Were want of proof of authenticity and reliability of the offered documentary evidence was, with respect to the Republic's Amended Complaint, the rationale behind the adverse <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span>, as it strikes this Court to be, we can only say that such disposition is not in accordance with Section 3 of EO No. 14 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> which enjoins courts, in  resolving  suits filed in the recovery efforts,  not to  strictly apply technical rules of evidence. Be that as it may,  we instead take the course of delving into the substance of the evidence on record which petitioner Republic asserts to be <span style="font-style: italic;">"vital facts and material evidence"</span>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and thereby determine whether or not  the respondent court  indeed justifiably  ignored them in arriving at the disputed holding dismissing the Amended Complaint as against the Cojuangcos/PHI. Towards this end, the Court shall  first  ascertain what could be those asserted <span style="font-style: italic;">"vital facts and material evidence"</span>  be  by looking at  the allegations of the Republic in its Petition.  Thus, according to the Republic's petition in <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R. No. 153459</span>, to cite pertinently:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> PHI was registered by Jose Y. Campos on November 8, 1977 with  a  paid-up capital of a measly Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) and utilizing as place of business the address of UNILAB, a corporation owned and controlled by Jose Y. Campos, and with UNILAB's officers and directors, namely Rolando Gapud, Renato Lirio, [etc.] . . . and Gervacio Gaviola managing PHI xxx albeit, said managing officers and directors had no financial interest whatsoever in PHI.<br><br></li><li> On May 2, 1978, Ramon U. Cojuangco, ceded and conveyed in favor of PHI by way of Deed of Assignment dated May 2, 1978, some 44,023 shares of stock of PTIC . . . .  On that same date, also by way of Deed of Assignment . . . Ramon U. Cojuangco ceded and conveyed in favor of PHI another 33,696 shares of stock of PTIC . . . .  Also on the same date, Luis Tirso Rivilla ceded and conveyed in favor of PHI another 33,696 shares . . . .  Ramon U. Cojuangco and Luis Tirso Rivilla were compensated by PHI for said PTIC shares of stock which all in all sum up to 111,415 shareholdings in the name of PHI. xxx<br><br></li><li> From the foregoing evidence, there is no doubt that respondent PHI is a corporation which was formed and organized and maintained by the former dictator, President Ferdinand E. Marcos through confessed dummies, Jose Yao Campos and Rolando C. Gapud, who, in conspiracy with Ramon U. Cojuangco and Luis Tirso Rivilla, sought to acquire for the Marcoses the single biggest majority shareholdings in PLDT.<br><br></li><li> The foregoing is confirmed by the declarations of confessed nominees/cronies of former President Ferdinand E.

Francisco de Guzman (Campos, Gapud and de Guzman, respectively, hereafter)  as alleged proof of its theory of the case, i.e., that the disputed PLDT shares are in fact owned by the Marcos family and that respondents Cojuangcos/PHI are but dummies/nominees/conduit  for the Marcos family to control PLDT.  It  is,  hence,  our task to scrutinize the sworn declarations of Campos et al.,  to  ascertain if they indeed prove the facts adverted to by petitioner Republic, failing which would naturally impel this Court to affirm the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial Decision</span> insofar as it dismissed the Republic's Amended Complaint against the respondents Cojuangcos/PHI.<br><br>Following are excerpts of the Sworn Statement of Mr. Campos, dated March 21, 1986 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>:<br><blockquote>"xxx a discussion between me and Mr. Ramon Diaz, a member of the Commission [PCGG} who inquired about certain assets and properties that I might be holding in favour (sic) of certain beneficiaries and which . . . are now about to be claimed by the Philippine Government.</blockquote><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> My relationship with the then President Ferdinand E.

However, since Mr. Gapud did not have the administrative staff to efficiently manage the businesses, he requested me that all the employees and officers involved in the organization should continue to remain in the companies even only in a nominal capacity considering that they had previously disclaimed any interest therein.  It is for this reason that Roland C. Gapud and my business associates, namely, . . . Francisco G. de Guzman, . . . Ernesto Abalos,  Gervasio T. Gaviola, . . ., Renato E.

Gapud regarding the beneficial ownership by President Marcos or any member of his family, directly or indirectly, of shares of stock in PLDT, PTIC, or Prime Holdings, Inc.?<br><br>ANSWER:   No, Ma'am.<br><br>xxx       xxx       xxx<br><br>11.   In your Sworn Statement, pages 2-3, you stated that because of a heart attack in the latter part of 1979, you requested President Marcos to relieve you or your responsibilities regarding the businesses entrusted to you, and that Rolando C. Gapud took over the direct responsibility of directing, managing and administering all the activities of the said corporations. xxx<br><br>ANSWER:   Yes, Ma'm.<br><br>11.1   Please describe in detail the circumstances surrounding the transfer, if any, of the direct responsibility of directing, managing and administering all the activities of PHI] to Mr. Gapud?<br><br>ANSWER:   As I stated Ma'am, Prime Holdings has been a holding company.  The only assets are the stock certificates and there is nothing.  I think â€“ at that time I transferred â€“ there is nothing Mr. Gapud has to manage to do because it's a shared corporation. (Words in bracket added)</blockquote>Contextually, the only conclusion the Court can plausibly attach to the above response of Mr. Campos is that he had no knowledge about PHI's shareholdings in PTIC. His answers, such as <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ma'm,  as I said I don't know that Prime Holdings has such holdings of the PTIC shares that you referred to"</span>, and "Any matters that pertain to PTIC I don't have any knowledge' say as much.   It is also a fact deducible from Mr. Campos' sworn declarations that he adhered to a set of pattern or practice when he organized corporations for then Pres. Marcos.  Thus, he declared that he, his family and his associates  executed deeds of trust or assignment in favor of an unnamed beneficiary, and there disclaim any interest in the  corporations that he (Mr. Campos) organized for Pres. Marcos.  Or, they indorsed the stock certificates in blank.  And, all of such deeds or certificates were delivered to the late President.  Yet, Mr. Campos was unable to declare with certitude if these patterns and practices were followed vis-Ã -vis PHI.  Accordingly,  the  question begging an answer is whether there truly exists, in respect to PHI shares, certificates indorsed in blank or deeds of trust or assignment in favor of an unnamed beneficiary delivered to the late President. If there is one person who can provide a satisfactory answer to this question, it is Mr. Campos. But he is not saying anything.   Under this scenario, we cannot see our way clear on how the sworn declarations of Mr. Campos could have, as asserted by petitioner Republic, proved that respondent PHI was merely incorporated to hold the PTIC shares, that in turn would have proved that PHI together with respondents Cojuangcos were mere dummies of the Marcos family to hold the controlling share of PLDT.<br><br>On the other hand, Mr. Gapud's deposition - taken on October 19, October 20 and December 11, 1995 at the Hong Kong Philippine Consulate Office -  materially reads:<br><blockquote>"CONSUL AGUILUCHO:<br><br>On paragraph 4 of Exhibit "E", Mr. Gaviola stated:<br><blockquote>"That I have no personal knowledge of the operation of Prime Holdings, Inc. as Mr. Rolando C.

We are objecting to the question on the ground that Mr. Gapud would be incompetent to testify with respect to Mr. Africa, considering that Mr. Africa is not among the stockholders-nominees mentioned by Mr. Campos or Mr. Gapud as far as Prime Holdings is concerned and Mr. Africa is not among the incorporators of Prime Holdings, Inc.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx       xxx       xxx<br></div><br>VICE CONSUL HERNANDEZ:  Can we note your objection and let Mr. Gapud answer?<br><br>So the aforesaid Deeds of Assignments obviously will be with the knowledge and upon authorization and order of former President Ferdinand E.

GAPUD:  Considering that [PHI] was incorporated upon the instructions of former President Marcos, obviously all the nominees would act only upon his authorization.  That's my answer.  <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></blockquote>Like Mr. Campos before him, Mr. Gapud also seems to be without personal knowledge of whether or not  PHI owned shares in PTIC. He admits that whatever he knows about PHI's holding in PTIC, if there be any, is based only on what he has read from the newspapers.  True it is that he acknowledged not actually owning the 400 PHI shares in his name.  But when asked for whom he held such shares, he hedged on his answer, saying: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Well, as I said earlier the shares and/or assignment indorsed in blank were delivered by Mr. Campos to President Marcos".</span>  Mr. Gapud, however, would later contradict himself with  respect to the disposition of the said 400 PHI shares  with his statement that he assigned what on paper  was his PHI shares to the late Ramon U. Cojuangco.  Clearly, it  would have been implausible  for him to  make the  assignment to Mr. Cojuangco if  the covering certificates had  previously been delivered to Pres. Marcos.  He  also  affirmed  that  his  assignment of PHI shares to Mr. Cojuangco was for a consideration, albeit this consisted of being freed from his fiduciary responsibilities as nominee and of the extinguishment of his liabilities on his subscription.<br><br>Taken as a package, Mr. Gapud's sworn statements do not sufficiently prove petitioner Republic's theory of the case.<br><br>The  sworn statement of Atty.

Guzman merely reiterated facts deducible from the sworn declarations of Mr. Campos and Mr. Gapud, foremost of which is that PHI was among the corporations organized upon Mr. Campos' instructions and that for all the corporations of Mr. Campos, deeds of trust or assignment were executed. Atty. De Guzman's statements are also affirmatory of the fact  that Mr. Gapud assigned PHI shares in his name to Mr. Cojuangco.  Interestingly,  however, Atty. De Guzman disclosed a detail about the formation and the running  of PHI  not heretofore known, i.e.,  that there were two copies of the deeds of trust or assignment, one a machine copy, and the other, the original,  that was kept in the records of the company.  But of particular significance from this disclosure is the actuality that until the time that Mr. Cojuangco assumed the chairmanship and presidency of PHI and the records were delivered to him (Cojuangco), the deeds of trust or assignment were on file with the records,<span style="font-style: italic;"> "except two (2) Deeds of Assignment which were xxx made directly afterward when Mr. Gapud and Mr. Jose Campos, Jr. made the direct assignments to persons actually designated in the Deeds of Assignments".</span><br><br>Given the above, it would appear  that the execution of the Deeds of Assignment to Ramon Cojuangco markedly departs from the set pattern usually followed in the organization of corporations on behalf of the late President Marcos, respondent PHI included.  The pattern, to repeat, consisted of: the execution of deeds of trust or assignment to an unnamed beneficiary, or to indorse in blank the stock certificates, and deliver the corresponding deeds to the late President.  In the case of what for the nonce may be referred to as the "Cojuangco assignment", the beneficiary portion of the deeds was not in blank. Instead, the name of Mr. Ramon Cojuangco specifically appeared therein. Possession of the deeds were with the respondents Cojuangcos, not the Marcoses, necessarily implying that nothing was delivered to the late President Marcos in regards to the covered PHI shares.  And there can be no serious argument that petitioner Republic has not produced any deed of assignment or trust executed to an unnamed beneficiary or certificates indorsed in blank which would have otherwise corresponded to the disputed shareholdings of the Cojuangcos in PLDT by virtue of the PHI shares assigned to them.<br><br>Upon the above observations and absent any positive testimony, even from persons already extended  by the PCGG state immunity from criminal prosecution and like privileges,  notably Messrs. Campos, Gapud and De Guzman,  provided  they disclose, among other things, relevant information respecting  the alleged accumulated "ill-gotten wealth" of the Marcoses, that respondents Cojuangcos held their assigned shares on behalf of the late Pres. Marcos, we also hold as untenable petitioner Republic's unyielding posture that the aforementioned deeds of assignment to respondents Cojuangcos are sham and fictitious.<br><br>In all, this Court is unable to accord concurrence to petitioner Republic's theory that the disputed PLDT shares, covered by the necessary PTIC stock certificates in the name of respondents Cojuangcos/PHI, are part of the Marcoses' <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth"</span>, for lack of direct and substantial proof thereof.  Petitioner Republic's recovery efforts cannot be predicated on speculations, surmises or vague inferences, as here.  In this sense,  the respondent court stood on solid legal ground when it held that <span style="font-style: italic;">"a claim or recovery of properties alleged by the Republic to have been ill-gotten cannot proceed under the mere presumption that said properties are indeed ill-gotten"</span>.<br><br>On another point, petitioner Republic has made much of respondent court's failure to appreciate in its favor the allegations, partaking of judicial admissions, made by respondent Mrs. Marcos in her Answer to its Amended Complaint, Cross-claim and other pleadings, bearing on the Marcoses' ownership of the disputed PLDT shares. In this regard, suffice it to state that these admissions are evidence against the party who made them or, in appropriate case, their privies. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> In the concrete, the admissions adverted to made by Mrs. Marcos, even if they partake of judicial admissions, are binding and conclusive only as to her. They cannot bind or prejudice respondents Cojuangcos/PHI who have taken issue against Mrs. Marcos on her ownership claim over the PLDT shares in question.<br><br>This brings us to what are known as the "General Telephone &amp; Electronics [GTE]  Documents", which to petitioner Republic are likewise material evidentiary link to  prove that the disputed PLDT shares form part of the Marcoses' <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth"</span>, but which merited scant consideration from, if not altogether ignored by, the respondent court.<br><br>Two (2) letters comprise the GTE Documents: one, purportedly from Leslie H. Warker of GTE to Mr. Ramon Cojuangco confirming an appointment with the latter's <span style="font-style: italic;">"principal"</span>;  and the other, from Theodore F. Brophy of GTE to US Assistant Secretary of State Eugene H. Braderman naming then Pres. Marcos as the "Principal". Per petitioner Republic's account, photo-copies of the GTE Documents were among the papers and materials seized by the US Customs Service  from the   Marcos family in February 26, 1986 in  Hawaii and subsequently turned over to  PCGG.<br><br>The Warker letter under date of  June 18, 1967 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>  reads in full, as follows:<br><blockquote>Mr. Ramon Cojuangco<br>Manila<br>Philippine Islands<br><br>Dear Mr. Cojuangco:<br><br>We have received your cable on July 18, 1967 to Mr. Douglas in which you confirmed that an appointment had been secured for Mr. Brophy to meet with your principal during the week of August 13, 1967, the date and hour to be finalized upon Mr. Brophy's arrival.<br><br>Based on this assurance, the "Proposal with Respect to the Sale of General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corporation's Stockholdings in [PLDT] to a Philippine Group" dated June 6, 1967 will remain open until 4:30 p.m. New York time on August 31, 1967, and unless accepted by that time (or further extended) will expire.<br><br>Article VIII.

Theodore F. Brophy'<br></div><br>Petitioner Republic contends that the said GTE Documents  are <span style="font-style: italic;">"authorized public records of a private document".</span> As such, it argues, citing Section 27 of Rule 132, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> that there would be no need to present the original copies thereof, as they may be proved by a mere copy thereof, provided such copy  is attested  by the legal custodian of the records, with an appropriate certificate that such officer has the custody. According to said petitioner, the attestation of Ms. Lourdes Magno, PCGG Record Officer, with the certification that she has such custody would suffice for the purpose of authenticating and proving their genuineness so as to have the GTE documents  received in evidence.<br><br>We disagree.  Not every single paper or document in the custody of PCGG in relation to its quest to recover the<span style="font-style: italic;"> "ill-gotten wealth" </span>of the Marcos family has the character and probative value of an<span style="font-style: italic;"> "authorized public record".</span>  Even the official seal of the PCGG on the two (2) GTE Documents does not suffice to make them "authorized public records" of a private document and thus enhance their admissibility.  The GTE Documents are still private writings.  The GTE Documents turned over by the US Government in the hands of the PCGG are not self-authenticating, for what is contextually considered a public document is not the private writing, but the public record thereof. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>  Their authenticity and due execution, as condition <span style="font-style: italic;">sine qua non </span> for their reception  in evidence, with the evidentiary weight they might otherwise be entitled to, must  first be  proved  under Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules  Court, which reads:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 20.   Proof of private document. â€“ Before any private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved either:<br><br>(a) By anyone who saw the document executed or written, or<br><br>(b) By evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker.<br><br>Any other private document need only be identified as that which it is claimed to be."</blockquote>A contrary ruling would otherwise put the recovery suits beyond the pale of the law on admissibility of evidence. This could not have been the intention of then President Corazon C. Aquino when she issued EO No. 14, series of 1986, supra,  providing that<span style="font-style: italic;"> "technical rules of procedure and evidence shall not be applied strictly  to [said ill-gotten wealth cases]."</span><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic vs. Sandiganbayan (Third Division),</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> the Court wrote:<br><blockquote>xxx   Eleven  years  have  passed  since  the government initiated its search for and reversion of such ill-gotten wealth.  The definitive resolution  of  such  cases  on  the  merits  is  thus  long overdue.  If there is proof of illegal acquisition, accumulation, misappropriation, fraud of illicit  conduct,  let it be brought out now.  Let the ownership of these funds and other assets be finally determined and resolved with dispatch, free from all the delaying technicalities and annoying procedural sidetracks.</blockquote>A little over six years (6) later, in July 2003, the Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic vs. Sandiganbayan </span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>  repeated the same message imparted in the  earlier Republic case, although the  clause <span style="font-style: italic;">"[A]lmost two decades have passed"</span> was used, and aptly so,  in lieu of <span style="font-style: italic;">"[E]leven years have passed".</span><br><br>What we said in both Republic cases is as sound and compelling as it is today. It should not, however, be given a slant to mean that the Court has laid down a  policy that each and every recovery suit brought by the PCGG shall be governed by different norms of justice or fair play.  Far from it.   If the required quantum of proof obtains to establish illegal acquisition, accumulation, misappropriation, fraud or illicit conduct, ours is the duty to affirm the recovery efforts of the Republic.  On the other hand, should  such  proof  be wanting, we have the equally exacting obligation to declare that it is so.  Simple justice demands such attitude from this Court. So does the guarantee against deprivation of property without due process,  which,  like other basic constitutional guarantees, applies to all individuals, including tyrants, charlatans and scoundrels of every stripe, to borrow from  Justice Isagani A. Cruz in his dissent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Marcos vs. Manglapus.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>It has been said that each case, and each litigious situation, must stand on its own peculiar set of facts, just as every case disposition must stand on the basis  of such facts established by relevant and competent evidence in the light of applicable statutory and decisional law. Other decided cases may be appropriate as points of reference , but, in the ultimate analysis, one's cause of action shall succeed or fail on the basis of the superiority of his evidence, taking into account the burden of proof assigned on each party and the <span style="font-style: italic;">quantum</span> of evidence required by the circumstances. So it must be with ill-gotten wealth recovery cases,<br><br>Insofar as the disputed PLDT shares in underlying <span style="font-weight: bold;">Civil Case No. 0002</span> are concerned, we agree with the holding of the respondent court  that there is no satisfactory proof that they are indeed  part  of  the <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth"</span>  being recovered by the State.  The case for petitioner Republic falls short to satisfy the standards set mainly in BASECO <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> to establish a finding of <span style="font-style: italic;">"ill-gotten wealth"</span>. We thus lend concurrence to respondent court's conclusion, that:<br><blockquote>"Hence, a claim for recovery of properties alleged by the Republic to have been ill-gotten cannot proceed under the mere presumption that said properties are indeed ill-gotten.  Before that characterization can be appended to the properties sought to (be) recovered, there must be proof of such claim.  The characterization cannot arise on the basis of public notoriety.  In the case at bar, the Republic failed to present the proof required to characterize the PLDT shares as ill-gotten.  As a necessary consequence of this failure, its claim for recovery thereof cannot succeed."

Garcia in his well-crafted Dissent in G.R. No. 153459 denying the Republic's petition and affirming respondent Sandiganbayan's Decision.<br><br>In civil suits for forfeiture before the Sandiganbayan, like the instant case, the Republic must meet the burden of proof and establish <span style="font-weight: bold;">with a preponderance of evidence </span>that the property in question â€”<blockquote>". . . are assets and properties purportedly pertaining to former President Ferdinand E. Marcos and/or his wife Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos, their close relatives, subordinates, business associates, dummies, agents or nominees which had been or were acquired by them directly or indirectly, through or as a result of the improper or illegal use of funds or properties owned by the Government of the Philippines or any of its branches, instrumentalities, enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking advantage of their office, authority, influence, connections or relationships, resulting in their unjust enrichment, and causing damage and prejudice to the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>The alleged ill-gotten assets in this case are shares of stock in Prime Holdings Inc. (PHI) which, in turn, holds shares in Philippine Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC), a shareholder in the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT).  The Republic's case is premised on the theory that PHI is a "dummy corporation," not owned by private respondent Cojuangco family, but merely held in beneficial trust for former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.<br><br>I have closely reviewed the records and revisited both factual and legal bases of the Sandiganbayan Decision, and found that the Republic failed to prove its case by preponderance of evidence.<br><br>The Republic's case is anchored almost entirely upon the testimonies of Messrs. Jose Y. Campos, Rolando Gapud and Francisco de Guzman.  They attempted to prove that PHI was a corporate vehicle "organized for" Marcos.  As "beneficial owner" of PHI, Marcos used Ramon U. Cojuangco as a "dummy" controlling PHI and its assets.<br><br>The same witnesses identified the <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi </span>employed by Marcos to hide his ill-gotten wealth.  Unfortunately, the evidence for the Republic fails to show that PHI is Marcos' "dummy corporation."<br><br>Witness Campos, in describing the <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi </span>behind dummy corporations "organized for" Marcos, stated:<br><blockquote>"In the organization, administration and management of the above-named corporations, as it was my policy that whenever such a corporation is organized for and on behalf of the intended beneficiaries, <span style="font-weight: bold;">I execute and I require all my said associates to execute a Deed of Trust or Deed of Assignment duly signed in favor of an unnamed beneficiary and to deliver the original copy thereof to the former President. </span> It is in fact my policy and procedure that we disclaim completely any interest in any such business and make it clear to the former President that we hold such interests on his behalf."</blockquote>In his affidavit, Campos named PHI as one of the companies he organized for President Marcos.  Yet, when asked if the <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi</span> was applied to PHI as it was with the other Marcos dummy corporations, he vacillated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>"3.  In your Sworn Statement, page 2, you stated that with respect to the corporations you held in trust for President Marcos, it was your "policy" that whenever such a corporation was organized, you executed, and you required all your business associates to execute, a Deed of Trust or Deed of Assignment in favor of an "unnamed beneficiary," and delivered the originals thereof to President Marcos. xxx Was this "policy" FOLLOWED IN THE CASE OF [PHI]" xxx<br><br>ANSWER: "All the corporations I organized â€“ that was the standard policy â€“ that we surrendered direct to President Marcos.Ã¯Â¿Â½"</blockquote>Campos also testified that he had <span style="font-weight: bold;">never communicated in any manner whatsoever with President Marcos, his alleged principal, nor with Ramon Cojuangco regarding MarcosÃ¯Â¿Â½ beneficial ownership of shares of stock in PHI or PTIC or Prime Holdings, Inc.,</span> thus:<br><blockquote>"7. Did you ever have any discussions or correspondences with President Marcos regarding his beneficial ownership or the beneficial ownership by any member of his family, directly or indirectly, of shares of stock in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Philippine Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC) or Prime Holdings, Inc."<br><br>Answer:  <span style="font-weight: bold;">No, Ma'am.</span><br><br>xxx<br><br>Did you ever have any discussions or correspondences with Ramon U. Cojuangco regarding the beneficial ownership by President Marcos or any member of his family, directly or indirectly, of shares of stock in PLDT, PTIC or Prime Holdings, Inc.?<br><br>Answer: <span style="font-weight: bold;"> No, Ma'am.Ã¯Â¿Â½</span></blockquote>Considering the fact that Campos " by his own admission Ã¯Â¿Â½ was the organizer of dummy corporations for Marcos, it is contrary to human experience that he never had any discussion with the former President about PHI, if indeed it was such a dummy corporation.<br><br>Obviously, there was nothing to discuss with President Marcos about PHI because it was not one of his dummy corporations.  In fact, the Republic's other witness, Atty. Francisco de Guzman, admitted that PHI did not meet the description of a Marcos dummy corporation, thus, to quote the very same passage cited in the Dissent:<br><blockquote>"Q: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Was it the standard operating procedure in Jose Yao Campos holdings companies that the stock certificates of the stockholders would be endorsed in blank?</span><br><br>A: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes, sir.</span><br><br>Q: And who would hold custody or possession of those/ bank endorsed stock certificates?<br><br>A:   In the case of many of the corporations I think including Prime Holdings, Inc. these are not fully paid shares and therefore, I knew that no stock certificates have been issued, sir.<br><br>Q: <span style="font-weight: bold;">So, specifically in the case of Prime Holdings, Inc. there were no stock certificates issued because the subscriptions were not fully paid?</span><br><br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you know if the stockholders of Prime Holdings, Inc., this is prior to 1981, had executed Deed of Assignment in blank for their subscription to PHI shares?</span><br><br>A: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes, sir, the standard operating procedure in the companies of Mr. Campos is that all the subscribers would have either a Deed of Assignment signed or a Deed of Trust, sir.</span><br><br>Q: And you are referring to these holding companies that Mr. Campos, a number of holding companies that Mr. Campos have caused to be incorporated, these are the companies?<br><br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: You said Deed of Trust, would there be a designated trustee?<br><br>A: No, sir.<br><br>Q: So, these are Deeds of Assignment or Deeds of Trust, the beneficiary of which would be left blank?<br><br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: But the assignors or the trustees or grantors would all sign, would all execute these Deeds?<br><br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: Who would have possession, you mentioned standard operating procedure or SOP, under the SOP who would hold the blank deeds?<br><br>A: A copy of which usually two (2) copies are made, sir.<br><br>Q: Two (2) originals?<br><br>A: No.<br><br>Q: Xerox copies?<br><br>A: No. One original and one Xerox copy and the original will be included in the records, sir.<br><br>Q: The records of that particular company?<br><br>A: Yes, sir, and the other one we give it to the Treasurer.<br><br>Q: Of that particular company?<br><br>A: No, to Mr. Gaviola, sir.<br><br>Q: Mr. Gaviola was the Treasurer of Prime Holdings, Inc. wasn't he?<br><br>A: I think he is because he is always, was the Treasurer of many of the companies of Mr. Campos, sir.<br><br>Q: So, there is the SOP also, MR.

De GuzmanÃ¯Â¿Â½s above admissions are fatal to the RepublicÃ¯Â¿Â½s case.  His categorical declaration is that the blank Deeds of Assignment and Deeds of Trust covering PHI shares were not delivered to Marcos, but to Ramon U. Cojuangco.<br><br>Now, delivery of the blank deeds of Assignment and Deeds of Trust was a crucial element of the <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi. </span> Considering that Marcos was not in possession of the Deeds over PHI shares, he could not have controlled or managed PHI.  To be sure, there was no point organizing PHI as a dummy corporation for Marcos since he could not perform these functions.<br><blockquote>Witness Gapud testified that he assigned his PHI shares to Ramon U. Cojuangco Ã¯Â¿Â½ not Marcos, thus:<br><br>Ã¯Â¿Â½CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Is it really true that you assigned your 400 shares [in Prime Holdings] to Ramon U. Cojuangco?</span><br><br>MR. GAPUD: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes.</span><br><br>CONSUL AGUILUCHO: How much did you receive as consideration for assigning your shares to him?<br><br>MR. GAPUD: The consideration for this assignment was that upon my assignment, first, my fiduciary responsibilities as nominee were extinguished, and secondly, I had transferred and extinguished any and all liabilities under the subscription payable.<br><br>CONSUL AGUILUCHO: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you know if Ramon Cojuangco received the said shares for himself or for anybody else?</span><br><br>MR. GAPUD: <span style="font-weight: bold;">I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t know.Ã¯Â¿Â½</span></blockquote>In fact, while he could have easily identified Marcos as the beneficial owner of PHI, witness Gapud Ã¯Â¿Â½ who succeeded Campos as President of PHI Ã¯Â¿Â½ refused under oath to do so.  Instead:<br><blockquote>Ã¯Â¿Â½CONSUL AGUILUCHO:  The heirs of Ramon U. Cojuango, namely Imelda O. Cojuangco and her childrenÃ¯Â¿Â½ claim that they own eighty (80) percent of the outstanding capital stock of Prime Holding, while the Estate of Ramon U. Cojuangco allegedly owns the remaining twenty (20) percent?  Question:  Based on your personal knowledge, do you affirm or deny the said allegation?<br>MR. GAPUD:  <span style="font-weight: bold;">I do not know.  I can neither affirm nor deny.Ã¯Â¿Â½</span></blockquote>The majority of my colleagues hold that Ã¯Â¿Â½GapudÃ¯Â¿Â½s statement relating to subsequent execution of deeds of assignment to Cojuangco and his kin does not detract from the prior delivery of blank deeds to the former President, especially so in this case where, by GapudÃ¯Â¿Â½s own recounting, he and his co-incorporators executed the 1981 and 1983 Deeds of Assignment with the knowledge and authorization of the same person to whom the earlier deeds were delivered Ã¯Â¿Â½ President Marcos.Ã¯Â¿Â½<br><br>But the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> conveniently sidesteps the reality that there is no evidence of such prior delivery to Marcos.  Witness de Guzman declared that the blank Deeds of Assignment over PHI shares were placed in the custody of the Legal Department, and thereafter delivered to Ramon Cojuangco, together with all the records of PHI.<br><br>The majority also hold that the alleged execution by the incorporators, as Ã¯Â¿Â½nomineesÃ¯Â¿Â½ of Marcos, of the Deeds of Assignment/Deeds of Trust is consistent with GapudÃ¯Â¿Â½s statement that he received virtually nothing in return for PHI shares.  But to my mind, this is fallacious Ã¯Â¿Â½ a conjecture made to fit an insignificant fact.  A straightforward explanation is simply that when the PHI shares were assigned to Ramon U. Cojuangco Ã¯Â¿Â½ the true beneficial owner -GapudÃ¯Â¿Â½s role as a nominee became untenable.   Obviously, a nominee's role ends when the principalÃ¯Â¿Â½s exercise of his right begins.<br><br>Nor is it accurate to say that there was an absence of consideration for the transfer of the PHI shares.   Gapud himself admitted that the consideration for the assignment of his shares to Cojuangco was the termination of his fiduciary responsibilities as nominee and the extinguishment of his liabilities under the subscription.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia </span>does not explain why Marcos allowed the execution of the Deeds of Assignment in favor of respondent Cojuangcos.  If PHI was indeed a dummy corporation, then it would be contrary to human experience for President Marcos to deprive himself of the legal mechanism to assert his alleged beneficial ownership.<br><br>Indeed, if the transfer of PHI shares to the Cojuangco family was with the "blessings" of President Marcos, then it can only mean the he was never interested in those shares Ã¯Â¿Â½ a fact consistent with CamposÃ¯Â¿Â½ statement that he "never discussed" the PHI shares with Marcos.  Therefore, the plausible reason for this is that Marcos never owned the shares in the first place.<br><br>The realistic scenario, therefore, is that these shares actually pertained to Ramon U. Cojuangco from the beginning and the assignments to him and members of his family merely confirmed what already existed in fact.   In other words, Cojuangco Ã¯Â¿Â½ not Marcos Ã¯Â¿Â½ has been the beneficial owner of the shares <span style="font-style: italic;">from the start</span>.  This explains why no blank Deeds of Trust or Assignment were executed and delivered by the stockholders of PHI, and the reason why they executed and delivered Deeds of Assignment specifically naming Ramon U. Cojuangco and the members of his family as the assignees of the PHI shares.  This also explains why PHIÃ¯Â¿Â½s capitalization was not increased despite its acquisition of PTIC shares.  An increase was unnecessary because Ramon U. Cojuangco actually did not part with the ownership of the PTIC shares transferred to PHI, since after all, he, not Marcos, owned the PHI.  That he is the owner thereof is shown by the following circumstances:<br><br>(a)  respondent Cojuangco took over as Chairman and President of PHI after the assignment; and (b)  the books and records of PHI were turned over to him, as testified to by de Guzman, the Republic's witness.   Certainly, these assignments are effective:<br><blockquote>Ã¯Â¿Â½When a formal deed of assignment is executed by the transferor in favor of a transferee, for the purpose of assigning shares of stock, endorsement and delivery requirements stated in Section 63 of the Corporation Code are deemed substantially complied with.  This mode of transfer covers a situation where no certificate of stock has been issued or where the stock certificate is not in the possession of the transferor-stockholder so that the shares of stock may be transferred by means of a deed of assignment.Ã¯Â¿Â½<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Additionally, the Republic failed to prove that Marcos had a subsisting interest in PHI.  There had been no intervention on his part in the affairs of PLDT, PTIC, or PHI.  Nor did he issue instructions that "hugely and inexplicably benefited" these companies indicating he had any actual interest therein.<br><br>Another source of debate in this case has been the evidentiary standard applicable to this and other ill-gotten wealth cases, given the Sandiganbayan's reliance on <span style="font-style: italic;">Baseco vs. PCGG</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and related jurisprudence.  The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span> stresses that this Court never intended to lay down evidentiary standards in <span style="font-style: italic;">Baseco</span> and, therefore, the Sandiganbayan's reference to such standards is nothing more than its "inference from its reading of the Decision."<br><br>I disagree.  To my mind, <span style="font-style: italic;">Baseco</span> is applicable.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Baseco</span> is a landmark ruling that confirms the <span style="font-style: italic;">modus operandi</span> described by the Republic's witnesses here.  In that case, "street certificates" (i.e. stock certificates endorsed in blank) and Deeds of Assignment to various corporations including <span style="font-style: italic;">Baseco,</span> also assigned in blank, were among the documents found to have been in Marcos' possession in MalacaÃ±ang.  We were convinced that based on such proof, Marcos 'actually owns well nigh one hundred percent of its outstanding stock."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>But unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Baseco,</span> here there is no such documentary evidence.   Neither PHI stock certificates nor PHI Deeds of Assignment have turned up in Marcos' hands.  Witness de Guzman testified that assignments of PHI shares were delivered to Cojuangco, not Marcos.   Documentary evidence (Exhibits"1" to "5", for instance) clearly identify Ramon U. Cojuangco and the members of his family as the assignees of PHI shares â€“ certainly removing any idea that these were assigned in blank to an "unnamed beneficiary."<br><br>Because this is a civil forfeiture case, then the Republic must establish, by a "preponderance of evidence," that the PHI shares were "ill-gotten wealth."   Its burden is explained by this Court, thus:<br><br>"Equiponderance of evidence rule states:<br><blockquote>When the scales shall stand upon an equipoise and there is nothing in the evidence which shall incline it to one side or the other, the court will find for the defendant.<br><br>Under said principle, the plaintiff must rely on the strength of his evidence and not on the weaknesses of defendant's claim.  Even if the evidence of the plaintiff may be stronger than that of the defendant, <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is no preponderance of evidence on his side if such evidence is insufficient in itself to establish his cause of action."</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Similarly:<br><br>"We are at a loss to determine which position is correct.  Under the circumstances, we are constrained to decide the issues under the rule of burden of proof.<br><br>Where the evidence on an issue of fact is in equipoise or there is any doubt on which the evidence preponderates the party having the burden of proof falls upon that issue, that is to say, if the evidence touching on disputed facts is equally balanced, or if it does not produce a just, rational belief of its existence, or it leaves the mind in a state of perplexity the party holding the affirmative as to such fact must fail. (23 C.J. 11-12)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>So must it be in this case.   On the assumption that the Republic has presented a persuasive case, it may not be said that the defendants do not have in their favor an equally persuasive one.   Even were we to find the balance of evidence to be just about at equipoise, the Republic's instant claim â€“ as a matter of law â€“ must fall.<br><br>Some might argue that the evidentiary requirement in civil forfeiture cases has an even higher standard, that is, proof beyond reasonable doubt.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Cabal vs. Kapunan,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> we ruled that proceedings for forfeiture of property in favor of the State (under the Anti-Graft Law) is criminal and penal in nature because such actions are primarily to punish for violation of a duty or a public wrong and to deter others from offending in the like manner.   Forfeiture of property is in substance a criminal proceeding, and such forfeiture has been held to partake of the nature of a penalty.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> I vote to <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENY</span> the petition in G.
