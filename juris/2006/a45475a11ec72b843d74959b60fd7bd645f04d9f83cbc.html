font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Rate and Rate-Fixing Defined</span><br><br>The crux of the controversy is whether the penalty charges imposed by the NPC are included in the term "<span style="font-style: italic;">rates.</span>"  Unfortunately, the pertinent laws stated above do not define rates and what is involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">rate-fixing.</span>  The Court, however, is not precluded from using other means to define these terms.<br><br>In the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, the general rule is that words and phrases are to be given their plain, ordinary and common-usage meaning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  It is presumed that the lawmakers employed the words in this sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Rate </span>is defined as "a charge, payment, or price fixed according to a ratio, scale, or standard;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  or "an amount paid or charged for a good or service."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Rates are <span style="font-style: italic;">fixed</span> on the basis of the investment amount or property value that the public utility is allowed to earn -- an amount value otherwise called "rate base."<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</span></span></sup>  Property valuation is dependent on the particular circumstances and relevant facts affecting each utility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  After all, rate-fixing calls for a technical examination and a specialized review of specific details primarily entrusted to the administrative or regulating authority -- in the present case, the ERB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>There are many factors considered in ascertaining this value, such as the original cost of construction; the amount expended in permanent improvements; the amount and market value of the bonds and stock of the public utility; the present cost compared with the original cost of construction; the probable earning capacity of the property under the particular rates prescribed; and the sum required to meet operating expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  It must be noted that the government is not bound to apply any particular method or formula for determining rates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>A just rate is founded on conditions that are fair and reasonable to both the public utility and the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>  This stipulation means that the public utility must have, as profit, a fair return on the reasonable value of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  The imposition of the maximum rates it charges cannot be confiscatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  As to the public, reasonableness requires entitlement to the service at an affordable cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Penalties as Rates</span><br><br>The penalties imposed by the NPC in its "Rules on the Sale of Electricity" are covered by the definition of <span style="font-style: italic;">rate</span>. "Minimum Charges" and "Penalties for Consumption in Excess of Allowable Limit" are exacted from customers in relation to the sale of energy.  These charges cannot be imposed without the sale of energy.  Indeed, a consideration in fixing rates is the purpose for which the penalties are constituted: the regulation of the system loads of transmission lines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">so as to ensure the continuous operation of the public utility or to cover part of its operating expenses.</span><br><br>The power to determine, fix and prescribe rates being charged customers is vested in the ERB.  Therefore, unless it gives prior approval, the penalties cannot be imposed by the NPC.  Without that authority, the challenged provisions in the "Rules on the Sale of Electricity" cannot be imposed on the electric plant operators that PEPOA represents.  While petitioner may issue rules and regulations consistent with its corporate objectives, provisions that have a bearing on the impositions of rates must be approved by the ERB.<br><br>In determining whether penalties are included in the term rates, this Court upholds the principle that the authority of a board or commission is construed in the light of the purposes for which it was created; and that whatever is incidentally necessary to a full implementation of the legislative intent should be upheld as germane to the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>  Jurisdiction over penalties is necessarily part of the ERB's regulatory functions; and is in line with the intent of achieving a coherent and effective policy formulation, coordination, implementation and monitoring within the energy sector.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Discounts, Not Rates</span><br><br>Petitioner contends that if the penalties are subject to ERB approval, so too must be the discounts in the latter's "Rules on the Sale of Electricity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  The discounts allegedly affect rates and benefit electric plant operators, who must then reimburse the NPC accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>  We do not agree.<br><br>Indeed, petitioner correctly points out that because the discounts affect rates, they should thus be a consideration in rate-fixing.  They are, however, not amounts paid or charged for the sale of electricity, but are <span style="font-style: italic;">reductions in rates.</span><br><br>Republic Act No. 7638 transferred the NPC's power to determine, fix and prescribe the rates <span style="font-style: italic;">being charged customers.</span>  They are charged nothing, though, when they are given discounts.  Evidently, the ERB's approval of the discounts is not necessary.<br><br><div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second Issue:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Provisional Relief</span><br></div><br>Petitioner further challenges the ERB's December 20, 1995 Order, which directed it to cease and desist from collecting the penalties, pending resolution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>  The NPC contends that the provisional relief required notice and hearing prior to being granted, similar to the requirement of the rule on preliminary injunction under Rule 58<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  Petitioner adds that PEPOA did not submit any supporting documents or affidavits to show the great or irreparable injury that would justify the provisional relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Authority to Grant</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Provisional Relief</span><br><br>The authority to grant provisional relief was conferred on the ERB, not under the Rules of Court but under Executive Order 172, whose pertinent provision reads:<br><blockquote>"Section 8. <span style="font-style: italic;">Authority to Grant Provisional Relief.</span> - The Board may, upon the filing of an application, petition or complaint or at any stage thereafter and without prior hearing, on the basis of supporting papers duly verified or authenticated, grant provisional relief on motion of a party in the case or on its own initiative, without prejudice to a final    decision after hearing, should the Board find that the pleadings, together with such affidavits, documents and other evidence which may be submitted in support of the motion, substantially support the provisional order: Provided, That the Board shall immediately schedule and conduct a hearing thereon within thirty (30) days thereafter, upon publication and notice to all affected parties."<br></blockquote>This Court explained the cited provision in C<span style="font-style: italic;">itizens' Alliance for Consumer Protection v.

The standard for granting provisional relief may be found in the laws creating or relating to the ERB.
