				<BR><BR>This case involves two consolidated petitions for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, seeking the nullification of Executive Order No. 420 (EO 420) on the ground that it is unconstitutional.<br><div align="justify"><br>EO 420, issued by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on 13 April 2005, reads:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">REQUIRING ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT-OWNED AND CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS TO STREAMLINE AND HARMONIZE THEIR IDENTIFICATION (ID) SYSTEMS, AND AUTHORIZING FOR SUCH PURPOSE THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL, NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THE SAME, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS</span>, good governance is a major thrust of this Administration;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span> the existing multiple identification systems in government have created unnecessary and costly redundancies and higher costs to government, while making it inconvenient for individuals to be holding several identification cards;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS</span>, there is urgent need to streamline and integrate the processes and issuance of identification cards in    government to reduce costs and to provide greater convenience for those    transacting business with government;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREAS,</span> a unified identification system will facilitate private businesses, enhance the integrity and reliability of government-issued identification cards in private transactions, and prevent violations of laws involving false names and identities.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO,</span> President of the Republic of the Philippines by virtue of the powers vested in me by law, do hereby direct the following:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 1.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;

No. 167798 allege that EO 420 is unconstitutional because it constitutes usurpation of legislative functions by the executive branch of the government. Furthermore, they allege that EO 420 infringes on the citizen's right to privacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioners in G.R. No. 167930 allege that EO 420 is void based on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><ol><li>EO 420 is contrary to law.  It completely disregards and violates the decision of this Honorable Court in Ople v. Torres et al., G.R. No. 127685, July 23, 1998.  It also violates RA 8282 otherwise known as the Social Security Act of 1997.<br><br></li><li>The Executive has usurped the legislative power of Congress as she has no power to issue EO 420.  Furthermore, the implementation of the EO will use public funds not appropriated by Congress for that purpose.<br><br></li><li>EO 420 violates the constitutional provisions on the right to privacy<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(i) It allows access to personal confidential data without the owner's consent.<br><br>(ii) EO 420 is vague and without adequate safeguards or penalties for any violation of its provisions.<br><br>(iii) There are no compelling reasons that will legitimize the necessity of EO 420.<br></div><ol start="4"><li>Granting without conceding that the President may issue EO 420, the Executive Order was issued without public hearing.         <br><br></li><li>EO 420 violates the Constitutional provision on equal protection of laws and results in the discriminatory treatment of and penalizes those without ID.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br style="font-weight: bold;"></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issues</span><br></div><br>Essentially, the petitions raise two issues.  <span style="font-style: italic;">First,</span> petitioners claim that EO 420 is a usurpation of legislative power by the President.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Second,</span> petitioners claim that EO 420 infringes on the citizen's right to privacy. <br><br>Respondents question the legal standing of petitioners and the ripeness of the petitions. Even assuming that petitioners are bereft of legal standing, the Court considers the issues raised under the circumstances of paramount public concern or of transcendental significance to the people.  The petitions also present a justiciable controversy ripe for judicial determination because all government entities currently issuing identification cards are mandated to implement EO 420, which    petitioners claim is patently unconstitutional. Hence, the Court takes cognizance of the petitions.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>  The petitions are without merit. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">On the Alleged Usurpation of Legislative Power</span><br><br>  Section 2 of EO 420 provides, "Coverage. - All government agencies and government-owned and controlled corporations issuing ID cards to their members or constituents shall be covered by this executive order." <span style="font-weight: bold;">EO 420 applies only to government entities that issue ID cards as part of their functions under existing laws</span>. These government entities have already been issuing ID cards even prior to EO 420. Examples of these government entities are the GSIS,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> SSS,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Philhealth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Mayor's Office,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> LTO,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> PRC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and similar government entities.   <br><br>Section 1 of EO 420 directs these government entities to "adopt a unified multi-purpose ID system."  Thus, all government entities that issue IDs as part of their functions under existing laws are required to adopt a <span style="font-weight: bold;">uniform data collection and format f</span>or their IDs.  Section 1 of EO 420 enumerates the <span style="font-weight: bold;">purposes</span> of the uniform data collection and format, namely:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>To reduce costs and thereby lessen the financial burden on both the government and the public brought about by the use of multiple ID cards and the maintenance of redundant database containing the same or related information;<br><br></li><li>To ensure greater convenience for those transacting business with the government and those availing of government services;<br><br></li><li>To facilitate private businesses and promote the wider use of the unified ID card as provided under this executive order;<br><br></li><li>To enhance the integrity and reliability of government-issued ID cards; and<br><br></li><li>To facilitate access to and delivery of quality and effective government service.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In short, the purposes of the uniform ID data collection and ID format are to reduce costs, achieve efficiency and reliability, insure compatibility, and provide convenience to the people served by government entities.<br><br>Section 3 of EO 420 <span style="font-weight: bold;">limits the data</span> to be collected and recorded under the uniform ID system to only 14 specific items, namely: (1) Name; (2) Home Address; (3)  Sex; (4) Picture; (5) Signature; (6) Date of Birth; (7) Place of Birth; (8)  Marital Status; (9) Name of Parents; (10) Height; (11) Weight; (12) Two index fingers and two thumbmarks; (13) Any prominent distinguishing features like moles or others; and (14) Tax Identification Number.<br><br>These limited and specific data are the <span style="font-weight: bold;">usual data</span> required for personal identification by government entities, and even by the private sector.  Any one who applies for or renews a driver's license provides to the LTO all these 14 specific data. <br><br>At present, government entities like LTO require considerably more data from applicants for identification purposes. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> EO 420 will reduce the data required to be collected and recorded in the ID databases of the government entities</span>.  Government entities cannot collect or record data, for identification purposes, other than the 14 specific data.<br><br>Various laws allow several government entities to collect and record data for their ID systems, either expressly or impliedly by the nature of the functions of these government entities.  Under their existing ID systems, some government entities collect and record more data than what EO 420 allows. At present, the data collected and recorded by government entities are disparate, and the IDs they issue are dissimilar.<br><br>In the case of the Supreme Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the IDs that the Court issues to all its employees, including the Justices, contain 15 specific data, namely: (1) Name; (2) Picture; (3) Position; (4) Office Code Number; (5) ID Number; (6) Height; (7) Weight; (8) Complexion; (9) Color of Hair;  (10) Blood Type; (11) Right Thumbmark; (12) Tax Identification Number; (13) GSIS Policy Number; (14) Name and Address of Person to be Notified in Case of Emergency; and (15) Signature. If we consider that the picture in the ID can generally also show the sex of the employee, the Court's ID actually contains 16 data. <br><br>In contrast, the uniform ID format    under Section 3 of EO 420 requires only "the first five items listed" in Section 3, plus the fingerprint, agency number and the common reference number, or only eight specific data.  Thus, at present, the Supreme Court's ID contains far more data than the proposed uniform ID for government entities under EO 420. The nature of the data contained in the Supreme Court ID is also far more financially sensitive, specifically the Tax Identification Number. <br><br>Making the data collection and recording of government entities unified, and making their ID formats uniform, will admittedly achieve substantial benefits. These benefits are savings in terms of procurement of equipment and supplies, compatibility in systems as to hardware and software, ease of verification and thus increased reliability of data, and the user-friendliness of a single ID format for all government entities. <br><br>There is no dispute that government entities can individually limit the collection and recording of their data to the 14 specific items in Section 3 of EO 420.  There is also no dispute that these government entities can individually adopt the ID format as specified in Section 3 of EO 420.  Such an act is certainly within the authority of the heads or governing boards of the government entities that are already authorized under existing laws to issue IDs. <br><br>A unified ID system for all these government entities can be achieved in either of two ways. First, the heads of these existing government entities can enter into a memorandum of agreement making their systems uniform. If the government entities can individually adopt a format for their own ID pursuant to their regular functions under existing laws, they can also adopt by mutual agreement a uniform ID format, especially if the uniform format will result in substantial savings, greater efficiency, and optimum compatibility. This is purely an administrative matter, and does not involve the exercise of legislative power.<br><br>Second, the President may by executive or administrative order direct the government entities under the Executive department to adopt a uniform ID data collection and format.  Section 17, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution provides that the "President shall have control of all executive departments, bureaus and offices."  The same Section also mandates the President to "ensure that the laws be faithfully executed."   <br><br>Certainly, under this constitutional power of control the President can direct all government entities, <span style="font-weight: bold;">in the exercise of their functions under existing laws</span>, to adopt a uniform ID data collection and ID format to achieve savings, efficiency, reliability, compatibility, and convenience to the public. The President's constitutional power of control is self-executing and does not need any implementing legislation.  <br><br>Of course, the President's power of control is limited to the Executive branch of government and does not extend to the Judiciary or to the independent constitutional commissions. Thus, EO 420 does not apply to the Judiciary, or to the COMELEC which under existing laws is also authorized to issue voter's ID cards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This only shows that EO 420 does not establish a national ID system because legislation is needed to establish a single ID system that is compulsory for all branches of government. <br><br>The Constitution also mandates the President to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. There are several laws mandating government entities to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and in general, improve public services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The adoption of a uniform ID data collection and format under EO 420 is designed to reduce costs, increase efficiency, and in general, improve public services. Thus, in issuing EO 420, the President is simply performing the constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.  <br><br>Clearly, EO 420 is well within the constitutional power of the President to promulgate. The President has not usurped legislative power in issuing EO 420. EO 420 is an exercise of Executive power - the President's constitutional power of control over the Executive department.  EO 420 is also compliance by the President of the constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. <br><br>Legislative power is the authority to make laws and to alter or repeal them. In issuing EO 420, the President did not make, alter or repeal any law but merely implemented and executed existing laws.  EO 420 reduces costs, as well as insures efficiency, reliability, compatibility and user-friendliness in the implementation of current ID systems of government entities under existing laws. Thus, EO 420 is simply an executive issuance and not an act of legislation. <br><br>The act of issuing ID cards and collecting the necessary personal data for imprinting on the ID card does not require legislation.  Private employers routinely issue ID cards to their employees. Private and public schools also routinely issue ID cards to their students. Even private clubs and associations issue ID cards to their members. The purpose of all these ID cards is simply to insure the proper identification of a person as an employee, student, or member of a club.  These ID cards, although imposed as a condition for exercising a privilege, are voluntary because a person is not compelled to be an employee, student or member of a club. <br><br>What require legislation are three aspects of a government maintained ID card system.  <span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, when the implementation of an ID card system requires a special appropriation because there is no existing appropriation for such purpose.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, when the ID card system is compulsory on all branches of government, including the independent constitutional commissions, as well as compulsory on all citizens whether they have a use for the ID card or not. <span style="font-style: italic;">Third,</span> when the ID card system requires the collection and recording of personal data beyond what is routinely or usually required for such purpose, such that the citizen's right to privacy is infringed. <br><br>In the present case, EO 420 does not require any special appropriation because the existing ID card systems of government entities covered by EO 420 have the proper appropriation or funding.  EO 420 is not compulsory on all branches of government and is not compulsory on all citizens.  EO 420 requires a very narrow and focused collection and recording of personal data while safeguarding the confidentiality of such data. In fact, the data collected and recorded under EO 420 are far less than the data collected and recorded under the ID systems existing prior to EO 420.  <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">EO 420 does not establish a national ID card system.</span>  EO 420 does not compel all citizens to have an ID card.  EO 420 applies only to government entities that under existing laws are already collecting data and issuing ID cards as part of their governmental functions.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every government entity that presently issues an ID card will still issue its own ID card under its own name</span>. The only difference is that the ID card will contain only the five data specified in Section 3 of EO 420, plus the fingerprint, the agency ID number, and the common reference number which is needed for cross-verification to ensure integrity and reliability of identification.         <br><br>This Court should not interfere how government entities under the Executive department should undertake cost savings, achieve efficiency in operations, insure compatibility of equipment and systems, and provide user-friendly service to the public.  The collection of ID data and issuance of ID cards are day-to-day functions of many government entities <span style="font-weight: bold;">under existing laws.</span>  Even the Supreme Court has its own ID system for employees of the Court and all first and second level courts.  The Court is even trying to unify its ID system with those of the appellate courts, namely the Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan and Court of Tax Appeals. <br><br>There is nothing legislative about unifying existing ID systems of all courts within the Judiciary.  The same is true for government entities under the Executive department.  If government entities under the Executive department decide to unify their existing ID data collection and ID card issuance systems to achieve savings, efficiency, compatibility and convenience, such act does not involve the exercise of any legislative power.  Thus, the issuance of EO 420 does not constitute usurpation of legislative power.<br><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">On the Alleged Infringement of the Right to Privacy</span>         <br><br>All these years, the GSIS, SSS, LTO, Philhealth and other government entities have been issuing ID cards in the performance of their governmental functions. There have been no complaints from citizens that the ID cards of these government entities violate their right to privacy. There have also been no complaints of abuse by these government entities in the collection and recording of personal identification data.<br><br>  In fact, petitioners in the present cases do not claim that the ID systems of government entities prior to EO 420 violate their right to privacy.  Since petitioners do not make such claim, they even have less basis to complain against the unified ID system under EO 420.  The data collected and stored for the unified ID system under EO 420 will be limited to only 14 specific data, and the ID card itself will show only eight specific data. The data collection, recording and ID card system under EO 420 will even require less data collected, stored and revealed than under the disparate systems prior to EO 420. <br><br>Prior to EO 420, government entities had a free hand in determining the kind, nature and extent of data to be collected and stored for their ID systems. Under EO 420, government entities can collect and record only the 14 specific data mentioned in Section 3 of EO 420.  In addition, government entities can show in their ID cards only eight of these specific data, seven less data than what the Supreme Court's ID shows.<br><br>Also, prior to EO 420, there was no executive issuance to government entities prescribing safeguards on the collection, recording, and disclosure of personal identification data to protect the right to privacy. Now, under Section 5 of EO 420, the following safeguards are instituted:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>The data to be recorded and stored, which shall be used only for purposes of establishing the identity of a person, shall be limited to those specified in Section 3 of this executive order;<br><br></li><li>In no case shall the collection or compilation of other data in violation of a person's right to privacy be allowed or tolerated under this order;<br><br></li><li>Stringent systems of access control to data in the identification system shall be instituted;<br><br></li><li>Data collected and stored for this purpose shall be kept and treated as strictly confidential and a personal or written authorization of the Owner shall be required for access and disclosure of data;<br><br></li><li>The identification card to be issued shall be protected by advanced security features and cryptographic technology;<br><br></li><li>A written request by the Owner of the identification card shall be required for any correction or revision of relevant data, or under such conditions as the participating agency issuing the identification card shall prescribe.<br></li></ol></blockquote>On its face, EO 420 shows no constitutional infirmity because it even narrowly limits the data that can be collected, recorded and shown compared to the existing ID systems of government entities. EO 420 further provides strict safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the data collected, in contrast to the prior ID systems which are bereft of strict administrative safeguards.  <br><br>The right to privacy does not bar the adoption of reasonable ID systems by government entities.  Some one hundred countries have compulsory national ID systems, including democracies such as Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg, and Portugal.  Other countries which do not have national ID systems, like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the Nordic Countries and Sweden, have sectoral cards for health, social or other public services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Even with EO 420, the Philippines will still fall under the countries that do not have compulsory national ID systems but allow only sectoral cards for social security, health services, and other specific purposes.<br><br>Without a reliable ID system, government entities like GSIS, SSS, Philhealth, and LTO cannot perform effectively and efficiently their mandated functions under existing laws.  Without a reliable ID system, GSIS, SSS, Philhealth and similar government entities stand to suffer substantial losses arising from false names and identities. The integrity of the LTO's licensing system will suffer in the absence of a reliable ID system.   <br><br>The dissenting opinion cites three American decisions on the right to privacy, namely, <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold v. Connecticut</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> U.S. Justice Department v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen v. Roe</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The last two decisions actually support the validity of EO 420, while the first is inapplicable to the present case. <br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a state law that prohibited the use and distribution of contraceptives because enforcement of the law would allow the police entry into the bedrooms of married couples.  Declared the U.S. Supreme Court: "Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of the marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives?  The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship."  Because the facts and the issue involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold</span> are materially different from the present case, <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold</span> has no persuasive bearing on the present case.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. Justice Department</span>, the issue was not whether the State could collect and store information on individuals from public records nationwide but whether the State could withhold such information from the press<span style="font-weight: bold;">.  The premise of the issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. Justice Department </span>is that the State can collect and store in a central database information on citizens gathered from public records across the country. </span> In fact, the law authorized the Department of Justice to collect and preserve fingerprints and other criminal identification records nationwide. The law also authorized the Department of Justice to exchange such information with "officials of States, cities and other institutions." The Department of Justice treated such information as confidential. A CBS news correspondent and the Reporters Committee demanded the criminal records of four members of a family pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Freedom of Information Act expressly exempts release of information that would "constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy," and the information demanded falls under that category of exempt information.  <br><br> With the exception of the 8 specific data shown on the ID card, the personal data collected and recorded under EO 420 are treated as "strictly confidential" under Section 6(d) of EO 420. These data are not only strictly confidential but also <span style="font-weight: bold;">personal matters.</span>  Section 7, Article III of the 1987 Constitution grants the "right of the people to information on matters of public concern." Personal matters are exempt or outside the coverage of the people's right to information on matters of public concern.  The data treated as "strictly confidential" under EO 420 being private matters and not matters of public concern, these data cannot be released to the public or the press. Thus, the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. Justice Department </span>does not collide with EO 420 but actually supports the validity EO  420. <br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen v. Roe</span> is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">leading American case on the constitutional protection for control over information.  </span>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the validity of a New York law that required doctors to furnish the government reports identifying patients who received prescription drugs that have a potential for abuse.  The government maintained a <span style="font-weight: bold;">central computerized database</span> containing the names and addresses of the patients, as well as the identity of the prescribing doctors.  The law was assailed because the database allegedly infringed the right to privacy of individuals who want to keep their personal matters confidential.  The U.S. Supreme Court <span style="font-weight: bold;">rejected </span>the privacy claim, and declared:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disclosures of private medical information</span> to doctors, to hospital personnel, to insurance companies, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">to public health</span> agencies are often an essential part of modern medical practice even when the disclosure may reflect unfavorably on the character of the patient. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Requiring such disclosures to representatives of the State having responsibility for the health of the community does not automatically amount to an impermissible invasion of privacy.</span> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Compared to the personal medical data required for disclosure to the New York State in <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen,</span> the 14 specific data required for disclosure to the Philippine government under EO 420 are far less sensitive and far less personal.  In fact, the 14 specific data required under EO 420 are routine data for ID systems, unlike the sensitive and potentially embarrassing medical records of patients taking prescription drugs.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen,</span> therefore, carries persuasive force for upholding the constitutionality of EO 420 as non-violative of the right to privacy.  <br><br>Subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions have reiterated <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen.</span>  In Pl<span style="font-style: italic;">anned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the U.S. Supreme Court<span style="font-weight: bold;"> upheld</span> the validity of a law that required doctors performing abortions to fill up forms, maintain records for seven years, and allow the inspection of such records by public health officials.  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that "recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible."  <br><br>Again, in P<span style="font-style: italic;">lanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the U.S. Supreme Court <span style="font-weight: bold;">upheld</span> a law that required doctors performing an abortion to file a report to the government that included the doctor's name, the woman's age, the number of prior pregnancies and abortions that the woman had, the medical complications from the abortion, the weight of the fetus, and the marital status of the woman.  In case of state-funded institutions, the law made such information publicly available. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Casey,</span> the U.S. Supreme Court stated: "The collection of information with respect to actual patients is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortion more difficult."<br><br>Compared to the disclosure requirements of personal data that the U.S. Supreme Court have upheld in <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen, Danforth</span> and Casey as not violative of the right to privacy,  the disclosure requirements under EO 420 are far benign and cannot therefore constitute violation of the right to privacy.  EO 420 requires disclosure of 14 personal data that are routine for ID purposes, data that cannot possibly embarrass or humiliate anyone.   <br><br>Petitioners have not shown how EO 420 will violate their right to privacy.  Petitioners cannot show such violation by a mere facial examination of EO 420 because EO 420 narrowly draws the data collection, recording and exhibition while prescribing comprehensive safeguards. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v. Torres</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is not authority to hold that EO 420 violates the right to privacy because in that case the assailed executive issuance, broadly drawn and devoid of safeguards, was annulled solely on the ground that the subject matter required legislation.  As then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice Artemio V. Panganiban noted in his concurring opinion in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v. Torres,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"The voting is decisive only on the need for appropriate legislation, and it is only on this ground that the petition is granted by this Court."</span><br><br>EO 420 applies only to government entities that already maintain ID systems and issue ID cards pursuant to their regular functions under existing laws.  EO 420 does not grant such government entities any power that they do not already possess under existing laws. In contrast, the assailed executive issuance in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v. Torres </span>sought to establish a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">National </span>Computerized <span style="font-weight: bold;">Identification </span>Reference <span style="font-weight: bold;">System,</span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> a national ID system that did not exist prior to the assailed executive issuance.  Obviously, a national ID card system requires legislation because it creates a new national data collection and card issuance system where none existed before.<br><br>In the present case, EO 420 does not establish a national ID system but makes the existing sectoral card systems of government entities like GSIS, SSS, Philhealth and LTO less costly, more efficient, reliable and user-friendly to the public.

Thus, the Constitution explicitly provides that the legislature shall be vested in the Congress, the executive power shall be vested in the President, and judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>The doctrine of separation of powers does not however, absolutely prohibit delegation of legislative authority.  The Constitution itself makes the delegation of legislative powers to the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Sections 23(2) and 28(2) of Article VI provide thus:<br> <blockquote>Sec. 23(2):  In times of war or other national emergency, the Congress may, by law, authorize the President, for a limited period and subject to such restrictions as it may prescribe, to exercise powers necessary and proper to carry out a declared national policy.

No. 420.  The contention is untenable.  Said provision merely declares that "the executive power shall be vested in the President of the Philippines."  It is generally defined as the power to enforce and administer laws.  It is the power of carrying the laws into practical operation and enforcing their due observance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  It does not in any way permit a delegation of legislative power.  Likewise, respondents    cannot validly cite Sections 23(2) and 28(2) of Article VI as above quoted since they refer to a delegation of certain powers which may be exercised only in times of war or other national emergency or the imposition of certain taxes or duties within the framework of the national development program of the government.  Certainly, E.O. No. 420 does not fall in either category.<br><br>Respondents also claim that the    Administrative Code of 1987 also empowers the President to issue executive orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and vests upon her residual powers;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> that the President has the inherent right to formulate rules which officials of the executive branch of government shall abide.<br><br>Indeed, the Administrative Code of 1987 delegates to the President certain ordinance powers in the form of presidential issuances, which include executive orders, administrative orders, proclamations, memorandum orders, memorandum circulars, and general and special orders. These issuances have the force and effect of laws.  Executive Orders are acts of the President providing for rules of a general or permanent character in implementation or execution of constitutional or statutory powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Among the rules and regulations that may be issued by the President are those intended for the guidance of subordinate executive officials to promote a more efficient and cost effective administration of government department and agencies. To this genre of regulations E.O. No. 420 allegedly belongs.<br><br>The case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Walter E. Olsen &amp; Co. v. Herstein</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> discusses at length executive orders, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x Executive Order No. 41 is nothing more or less than a command from a superior to an inferior. It creates no relation except between the official who issues it and the official who receives it. Such orders, whether executive or departmental, have for their object simply the efficient and economical administration of the affairs of the department to which or in which they are issued <span style="font-weight: bold;">in accordance with the law governing the subject matter. They are administrative in their nature and do not pass beyond the limits of the department to which they are directed or in which they are published, and, therefore, create no rights in third persons. They are based on, and are the product of, a relationship in which power is their source and obedience their object.</span> (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote>To be valid, an administrative issuance, such as an executive order, must comply with the following requisites:<br><blockquote>(1) Its promulgation must be authorized by the legislature;<br><br>(2) It must be promulgated in accordance with the prescribed procedure;<br><br>(3) It must be within the scope of the authority given by the legislature; and<br><br>(4) It must be reasonable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>It cannot be argued that E.O. No. 420 is nothing more than the President's exercise of the power of control over the executive branch of the government. While it is true that the President wields executive and administrative powers and participate in rule making through delegated legislative authority, however, Congress cannot abdicate its legislative powers and delegate them, <span style="font-weight: bold;">unless the Constitution and the law so grant.</span>  Notwithstanding, the avowal by the respondents that E.O. No. 420 is merely an internal regulation to promote efficiency in government operations and greater convenience for those transacting business with the government, the unrestricted and unrestrained impact of a unified multi-purpose ID system divests itself of the pretensions of an internal management issuance. As the term denotes, the multipurpose ID card system can be utilized in any and all conceivable situations involving government or even private transactions as the whereas clause so states.  Unlike existing government ID cards which are designed for <span style="font-weight: bold;">specific and official </span>transactions, the multipurpose ID is devoid of such specificity.  The scope of its usage is staggering and all encompassing.  With its ubiquitous application, its legal and practical repercussions will not be confined solely to the corridors of the executive departments but will overflow even beyond. Thus, E.O. No. 420, while ostensibly an internal regulation, runs counter to the letter and spirit of the doctrine that an    executive order is nothing more or less than a command from a superior to an    inferior; that it creates no relation except between the official who issues it and the official who receives it.<br><br>Another statutory basis invoked by respondents to justify E.O. No. 420 is Sec. 20, Chapter 7, Title I, Book III of the Administrative Code of 1987 which states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 20.  Residual Powers. - Unless Congress provides otherwise, the President shall exercise such other powers and functions vested in the President which are provided for under the laws and which are not specifically enumerated above or which are not delegated by the President in accordance with law.<br></blockquote>However, the residual power contemplated above can operate only within the context of a pre-existing law. It cannot stand independent of a valid legislative act. Thus, the legal character of E.O. No. 420 is much unlike that of E.O. No. 132 as illustrated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Larin v. Executive Secretary</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> where the Court upheld the challenged order since there exists statutory basis that the President is authorized to effect organizational changes including the creation of offices in the department or agency concerned.  Further ratiocinating on the legality of E.O. 132, the Court held:<br><blockquote>Another legal basis of E.O. No. 132 is Section 20, Book III of E.O. No. 292 which states:<br><br>"Sec. 20. <span style="font-style: italic;">Residual Powers.</span> - Unless Congress provides otherwise, the President shall exercise s<span style="font-style: italic;">uch other powers and functions vested in the President which are provided for under the laws</span> and which are not specifically enumerated above or which are not delegated by the President in accordance with law." (italic ours)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">This provision speaks of such other powers vested in the President under the law.  What law then gives him the power to reorganize?  It is Presidential Decree No. 1772 which amended Presidential Decree No. 1416.  These decrees expressly grant the President of the Philippines the continuing authority to reorganize the national government, which includes the power to group, consolidate bureaus and agencies, to abolish offices, to transfer functions, to create and classify functions, services and activities and to standardize salaries and materials.</span>  The validity of these two decrees are unquestionable.  The 1987 Constitution clearly provides that "all laws, decrees, executive orders, proclamations, letters of instructions and other executive issuances not inconsistent with this Constitution shall remain operative until amended, repealed or revoked.

No. 308 requires a concerted and collaborative effort among the various basic services and social security providing agencies and other government instrumentalities to achieve the national ID system, while E.O. No. 420 requires all government agencies and instrumentalities to institute a unified multipurpose ID system.<br><br>At the forefront of the implementation of both ID systems is the entire government machinery. The government as an institution is the most dominant fixture in any civilized society. Its decisions virtually affect every facet in the life of every citizen. With all government instrumentalities required to adopt the proposed ID system, its reach and extent becomes practically inescapable since, as in the words of Ople v. Torres, "no citizen will refuse to get this identification card for no one can avoid dealing with government. It is thus clear as daylight that without the ID, a citizen will have difficulty exercising his rights and enjoying his privileges."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The proposed ID systems incorporate a reference number, denominated as the Population Reference Number in A.O. No. 308 and as a "common reference number" in E.O. No. 420. This reference number, together with other data requirements and information, shall then be collected and stored in a centralized computer database, which is sought to establish a government-wide linkage among concerned agencies, or to reduce the cost for the maintenance of redundant database containing the same or related information.  Like A.O. No. 308, the collated and stored data under E.O. No. 420 will be made readily accessible to any government agency or instrumentality which makes a request. The State is afforded an unbridled authority to retrieve or utilize stored data for whatever purpose it deems necessary. Although E.O. No. 420 spells out the general intent of the proposed ID system, which is to establish the identity of the person, it is difficult to decipher a more specific reason for its adoption. After all, an ID card, whatever form or design it takes, is essentially a tool for identification. The equivocal and vague objective of the proposed ID system is an invitation not only to its proper use but also to its misuse and abuse.<br><br>Even the safeguards delineated in E.O. No. 420 will not cure its fatal infirmities. Other than the motherhood assurances of confidentiality, or that the data stored will be used solely for establishing the identity of a person, or the proscription against violation of the right to privacy, there are no clear, specific and categorical guarantees that would dispel trepidations and suspicions of mistreatment and abuse.  We can only repeat the apprehensions resoundingly expressed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v. Torres:</span><br><blockquote>We can even grant, arguendo, that the computer data file will be limited to the name, address and other basic personal information about the individual. Even that hospitable assumption will not save A.O. No. 308 from constitutional infirmity <span style="font-style: italic;">for again said order does not tell us in clear and categorical terms how these information gathered shall be handled. It does not provide who shall control and access the data, under what circumstances and for what purpose.</span> These factors are essential to safeguard the privacy and guaranty the integrity of the information. Well to note, the computer linkage gives other government agencies access to the information. <span style="font-style: italic;"> Yet, there are no controls to guard against leakage of information.</span> When the access code of the control programs of the particular computer system is broken, an intruder, without fear of sanction or penalty, can make use of the data for whatever purpose, or worse, manipulate the data stored within the system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Prescinding from the above reasoning, the identification of the 14 items to be collected under E.O. No. 420 does not divest it of its illegality.  It does not narrow down its application in the absence of well-defined parameters for its application.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Right to Privacy:</span><br><br>The right to privacy is the inalienable right of an individual to be let alone.  As a legal precept, the privacy of an individual takes its bearing from common law which recognized a man's house as his castle, impregnable, often, even to its own officers engaged in the execution of its commands. Although the great preponderance of American judicial authority have recognized the existence of the right of privacy, it was the publication in 1890 of Harvard Law Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> article entitled "The Right to Privacy" by Warren and Brandeis (later Justice Brandeis) which crystallized the right as an independent legal right and opened the doors for a more systematic formulation of the distinctive principles upon which it is based.  That article synthesized at one stroke a whole new category of legal rights and initiated a new field of jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The U.S. Constitution does not explicitly express the right to privacy, yet the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, albeit implicitly, such a right in its efforts to preserve the individual's control over his personal image. The U.S. Supreme Court, in 1965, recognized that privacy is within the legal penumbra of the Bill of Rights, particularly in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold v. Connecticut</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the U.S. Supreme Court laid down the constitutional foundations of the right to privacy. The Court recognized the need to protect basic constitutional rights and applied the same against the states under the Due Process Clause, mandating a stricter scrutiny for laws that interfere with "fundamental personal rights" than for those regulating economic relations. One such fundamental personal right, the right to privacy, was deemed to have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give life and substance reasoning that the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments of the American Constitution imply "zones of privacy" that form the basis for the general privacy right affirmed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold v. Connecticut.</span><br><br>The U.S. Supreme Court is yet to fully expand the right to privacy to the level of an independent doctrine covering personal information, although the Federal High Court implicitly acknowledged the existence of the right to information in <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen v. Roe.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In that case, the State of New York passed a law requiring physicians to identify patients obtaining prescription drugs enumerated in the Controlled Substance Act of 1972, drugs with medical application but with potential for abuse. The names and addresses of the patients were required to be recorded in a centralized computer file of New York State's Department of Health. The issue presented before the U.S. Supreme Court was whether the State of New York could keep a centralized computer record of the names and addresses of all persons who obtained certain drugs pursuant to a doctor's prescription.<br><br>The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the above statute since it complied with certain safeguards to the right to privacy, namely: 1) while a person's interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters is an aspect of the right to privacy, the law did not give a grievous threat to establish a constitutional violation; 2) the statute was necessary to assist in the enforcement of the law designed to minimize the misuse of dangerous drugs; 3) the patient-identification requirement was a product of an orderly and rational legislative decision made upon recommendation by a commission, which held hearings on this matter; 4) the law was narrowly drawn and contained several safeguards against indiscriminate disclosure; 5) the law laid down the procedure for the gathering, storage, and retrieval of the information; 6) it enumerated who were authorized to access the data; and 7) it prohibited public disclosure of the data by imposing penalties for its violation.<br><br>In a related case, <span style="font-style: italic;">Justice Department v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dealt with a request for "rap sheets" compiled by the FBI. The information was gathered from public records across the country and stored in a computer database.  In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld withholding the information and articulated a "practical obscurity" doctrine (a judicial acceptance of "forgive and forget") in which the Court assumed that computers exacerbate the threat to personal privacy by eliminating the natural elements of time and distance among "scattered bits of information" that once afforded individuals the ability to distance themselves from past mistakes and start their lives anew. It further concluded that compilations of personal information taken from generally accessible public records enjoyed a rejuvenated privacy interest when stored in government computers and that disclosure of certain categories of public information held in computers always constituted an undue privacy threat and could routinely be deemed an unwarranted privacy threat and be withheld without a case-by-case analysis.  Exemptions 6 &amp; 7 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) had been interpreted by courts as requiring a balancing of competing interests, whereby the courts considered the privacy interests at stake against the public benefit from disclosure. The Court held a seemingly narrow view of the public interest served by disclosure, focusing only on information that had an obvious bearing on the agency's performance of its statutory duties. In other words, although the government collects vast amounts of information on virtually every facet of society, the public is entitled to have access only to information pertaining to governmental functions.<br><br>Philippine jurisprudence on the right to privacy, not to mention informational privacy, is at its infancy. There are very few occasions that Philippine courts are given the opportunity to resolve and expound on issues relating to the right to privacy as a constitutional guarantee. One reason given by Justice Jorge R. Coquia, in his treatise<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> on the matter is that the Philippine Constitution expressly guarantees only the privacy of communication and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>With the exception of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Ople v. Torres</span>, the more notable case is <span style="font-style: italic;">Morfe v. Mutuc</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> where the Court first recognized the constitutional right to privacy as laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">Griswold v. Connecticut.</span>  The case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ramirez v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> arose from petitioner's act of secretly tape recording an event in direct violation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4200 or the Anti-Wiretapping Act.  Therein, the court clarified that even a person privy to a communication who records his private conversation with another without the knowledge of the latter will qualify as a violator under Section 1 of R.A. No. 4200.<br><br>The basic attribute of an effective right to informational privacy is the individual's ability to <span style="font-weight: bold;">control</span> the flow of information concerning or describing him, which however must be overbalanced by legitimate public concerns.  To deprive an individual of his power to control or determine whom to share information of his personal details would deny him of his right to his own personhood. For the essence of the constitutional right to informational privacy goes to the very heart of a person's individuality, a sphere as exclusive and as personal to an individual which the state has no right to intrude without any legitimate public concern.<br><br>As the erosion of personal privacy by computer technology and advanced information systems accelerate, the individual's ability to control its use has diminished. Sharing of data among government agencies and private and public organizations are not uncommon. Aside from the chilling prospect that one's profile is being formed from the gathering of data from various sources, there is also the unsettling thought that these data may be inaccurate, outdated or worse, misused. There is therefore a pressing need to define the parameters on the use of electronic files or information, to be properly initiated by a legislative act and not formulated in a mere executive order masquerading as an internal regulation, as in the case of E.O. No. 420.<br><br>Even granting that E.O. No. 420 constitutes a valid exercise of executive power, it must still be struck down because it falls short of the guarantees laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">Whalen v. Roe</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v. Torres</span>.  There is no specific and foolproof provision against the invasion of the right to privacy, particularly, those dealing with indiscriminate disclosure, the procedure for the gathering, storage, and retrieval of the information, an enumeration of the persons who may be authorized to access the data; and the sanctions to be imposed against unauthorized use and disclosure.  Although it was mentioned in Section 3 of E.O. No. 420 that the data to be collected will be limited to the enumeration therein, yet it failed to provide the yardstick on how to handle the subsequent and additional data that will be accumulated when the ID is used for future governmental and private transactions.<br><br>Thus, we reiterate the caveat enunciated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v. Torres </span>that "the right to privacy does not bar all incursions into individual privacy.  The right is not intended to stifle scientific and technological advancements that enhance public service and the common good. It merely requires that the law be narrowly focused and a compelling interest justifies such intrusions. Intrusions into the right must be accompanied by proper safeguards and well-defined standards to prevent unconstitutional invasions. We reiterate that any law or order that invades individual privacy will be subjected by this Court to strict scrutiny."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In fine, E.O. No. 420 is unconstitutional for lack of constitutional and statutory basis; its subject matter is not appropriate subject of an executive order; and it violates the constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCORDINGLY</span>, I vote to <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANT</span> the petitions.<br><div style="text-align: right;">          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></div><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</span></sup> 354 Phil. 948 (1998).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Agpalo, Ruben E., Philippine Administrative Law, 2004 Edition, p. 149.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ople v.
