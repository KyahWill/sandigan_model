Club Filipino, Inc.</span>"<br><div align="justify"><br>Romeo Araullo (respondent) was the Maintenance Supervisor of Club Filipino (petitioner). On September 30, 2000, during a routine inspection of employees who were leaving the premises of petitioner's Club House, two brand new faucets were found inside respondent's traveling bag which he claimed to be his personal property. He was to present two days later OCG Trading Original Sales Invoice No. 379612 dated September 28, 2000 in the amount of P490 purportedly covering the sale to him of the faucets.<br><br>On the same day, September 30, 2000, Ricardo Sesmar, the security-in-charge, by an Information Report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> brought to the attention of the management the incident.<br><br>Acting on the Report, Salvador Arinto, the Personnel Supervisor of the Club, required respondent to explain why no disciplinary action should be taken against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Respondent maintained, however, that the faucets were his.<br><br>An investigation of the incident was thus held on October 18, 2000 during which respondent presented evidence. Another was scheduled on December 8, 2000 during which respondent was given opportunity to present additional evidence but respondent failed to appear.<br><br>By Report of December 11, 2000, the Investigating Committee recommended respondent's dismissal for loss of trust and confidence. A December 23, 2000 notice of termination was thus served upon him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Subsequently or on January 24, 2001, respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> By Decision of November 15, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Labor Arbiter, finding that respondent could no longer be trusted by petitioner, dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.<br><br>Respondent filed an appeal to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which, by Decision of July 30, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dismissed the same for lack of merit.

The Decisions of the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter are vacated and set aside. Petitioner Araullo's dismissal is hereby declared illegal. Accordingly, the respondent Club Filipino is hereby ordered to reinstate Araullo to his former position without loss of seniority rights and to pay petitioner full back wages, inclusive of allowances, including 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, as well as other monetary benefits, computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him to the time of his reinstatement. Should reinstatement be no longer possible the respondent Club Filipino should instead pay Araullo separation pay equivalent to one month a day for every year of service, with the fraction of at least six (6) months be considered as one whole year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Finding that the period of appeal had expired, respondent filed before the appellate court a Motion for Entry of Judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Before the appellate court could resolve the motion, it received a copy of a Petition for Review filed by petitioner before this Court, drawing the appellate court to deny respondent's motion on May 20, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In its Petition for Review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> petitioner faults the appellate court for: <br><blockquote><ol><li>HOLDING AND TREATING THE ORIGINAL PETITION OF THE RESPONDENT AS A PETITION FOR CERTIORARI DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE ALLOWABLE LEGAL GROUNDS AS WELL AS THE REQUIRED FORMALITIES;</li><br><li>DECID[ING] IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH ARTICLE 282 par.(A), (C) AND (D) OF THE LABOR CODE AND EXTANT JURISPRUDENCE IN DECLARING THE DISMISSAL OF HEREIN RESPONDENT TO BE ILLEGAL.</li><br><li>DECIDING THAT THE COPY OF THE RESPONDENT'S RECEIPT BEARING SERIAL NO. 379612 CANNOT BE CONCLUDED AS TAMPERED DESPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE LABOR ARBITER AND THE NLRC MADE A CONCLUSIVE FINDINGS OF FACT ESTABLISHING THEREIN THAT THE RECEIPT IN POSSESSION OF THE RESPONDENT HAS BEEN TAMPERED AND FORGED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>For his part, respondent in his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> argues that the Petition, apart from being fatally defective for lack of certification against forum-shopping, was filed beyond the reglementary period since it received the February 28, 2005 Decision of the appellate court on March 3, 2005 and, therefore, had up to March 18, 2005 to file the petition, but it filed the same only on April 27, 2005.<br><br>To prove that petitioner received a copy of the Decision on March 3, 2005, respondent attached a certified photocopy of Registry Return Receipt No. 2706<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> covering the envelope containing the copy of said decision sent to petitioner's counsel, and a Certification of Proof of Service of registered letter No. 2706 dated April 25, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the San Juan Central Post Office which reads:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>In connection with your inquiry, I hereby certify that Registered Letter No. 2706 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">addressed</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[petitioner's</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">counsel]</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atty.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ernesto</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tabao</span>, Room 1004, 10<sup>th</sup> Floor Atlanta Center, 31 Annapolis Street, Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">delivered</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">received</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">MELANIE</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">P.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ABEJERO</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> â€” <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MARCH</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">3,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">2005</span>.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Respondent also submitted another Certification of Proof of Service dated May 12, 2005, which was notarized by Notary Public Romualdo C.

And it submitted a May 6, 2005<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Affidavit of Melanie A. Intia (Melanie). Melanie, acknowledging that her maiden name is Abejero, the family name of the one who acknowledged receipt on March 3, 2005 of copy of the appellate court's decision addressed to petitioner's counsel, claimed that she had stopped using her maiden name after her marriage in December 2004 and had since been using the surname of her husband. And she denied having received a copy of the decision of the Court of Appeals, adding that:<br><blockquote>[the signature appearing on Registry Receipt No. 2706] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">although</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">resembling</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">my</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">former</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">signature</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">when</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">single,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suffers</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">very</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">basic</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inconsistencies</span>. In the first place [t]he M in my former signature is very prominent and enlarged as can be seen in my signature in my marriage contract (Annex "B"). Secondly, my B in my signature is not that prominent as that in the subject return card. More importantly, the "J" and the "R["] as appeared [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] on the signature card is different from my former signature as appeared [sic] on the same marriage contract;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The present petition must fail.<br><br>While the petition contains a verification and a Secretary's Certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> it lacks a certification against forum-shopping which is generally not curable by the submission thereof after the filing of the petition, albeit the rule thereon may be relaxed on grounds of "substantial compliance" or "special circumstance or compelling reasons."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Even if the rule on certification against forum shopping were to be relaxed, however, the petition would still fail, the assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals having become final and executory.<br><br>As earlier stated, Registry Return Card No. 2706 shows that a copy of the appellate court's decision addressed to petitioner's counsel was received on March 3, 2005 by his secretary Melanie. <span style="font-style: italic;">Genuino Ice Company, Inc. v. Magpantay</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> teaches:<br><blockquote>The presumption is that the decision was delivered to a person in his office, [received by a person] who was duly authorized to receive papers for him, in the absence of proof to the contrary.

Thus, it was necessary for respondent (in this case, the petitioner) to rebut that legal presumption with competent and proper evidence. (Italics in the original, underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Melanie's above-stated affidavit does not suffice to overcome the presumption of regularity of the performance of the postmaster's official duty. The record is replete with documentary proof that, contrary to Melanie's claim, she continued using her maiden name Abejero even after her marriage in December 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Melanie's claim that there are "very basic inconsistencies" between the signature appearing on the Registry Return Receipt and her signatures before her marriage, thereby implying that the signature attributed to her in the said receipt was forged, does not persuade.<br><blockquote>The volume of work to be done and the numerous documents to be filled up and signed must likewise be considered.
