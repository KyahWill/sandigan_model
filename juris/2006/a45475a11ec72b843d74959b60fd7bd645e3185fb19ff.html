Manuel Reyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Molina was hired as Assistant Vice-President and Marketing Head of Area 10.&nbsp; His wife, Fe Molina, was the head of a sales agency of Caritas.<br><br>In the meantime, from February 2000, there was a considerable decrease in the sales output production of PPI's Metro Manila Region VI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On March 21, 2000, Molina received a Memorandum from PPI, through its Senior Assistant Vice-President for Human Relations, Patricio A. Picazo, informing him that, based on written reports, he committed the following: 1) recruiting and pirating activities in favor of Caritas, in particular, initiating talks and enticing associates to join Caritas, and a number of associates have already signed up; 2) he called for a meeting with his associates sometime in November 1999, and solicited contributions from them for the bill but later asked for reimbursement from the company; and 3) acts of misdemeanor on several occasions, such as coming to the office under the influence of liquor, initiating a smear campaign against PPI, and other acts inimical to the company's interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Molina was also required to submit, on March 23, 2000, a written explanation why he should not be held administratively liable for said acts which, it opined, might constitute conduct unbecoming of an officer, conflict of interest, and breach of trust and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;confidence.

Thereafter, it filed a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>before the CA, assailing the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC and its order denying the motion to dismiss the complaint.&nbsp; On July 16, 2001, the CA rendered judgment in favor of PPI and nullified the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the RTC as well as the order denying the motion of PPI for the dismissal of the complaint. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On July 30, 2001, PPI resolved to dismiss Molina from employment on its finding that the latter violated its standard operating procedure. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Molina forthwith filed a complaint with the NLRC against PPI and Alfredo C. Antonio, Patricio A. Picazo, and Certerio B. Uy, in their capacity as President, Senior Assistant Vice-President of Human Resources Development, and Division Head, respectively, for illegal dismissal and illegal suspension with claim for monetary benefits.<br><br>In his Position Paper, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Molina principally argued that he was denied the right to due process due to the failure of PPI to furnish him a copy of the written reports of the sales associates and co-employees, the basis of the accusations against him.&nbsp; Since an OIC for his position was already appointed even before all his pending motions were resolved, he surmised that there were really no such reports, and that the alleged accusations were merely concocted in order to replace him with someone close to Picazo.&nbsp; Molina maintained that since he was denied the opportunity to dispute the authenticity and substantive contents of the reports, his alleged violations of company rules and policies were hearsay and, therefore, lacked probative value.&nbsp; Besides, the termination of his employment was made without the 30-day prior notice; his dismissal from employment took effect immediately, only six days after PPI received the CA decision decreeing that the NLRC has the rightful jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Thus, he prayed for the following relief:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Total Money Claims<br>a)&nbsp; Salary with (overriding) commission from March 21 to April 24, 2000 â€” suspended w/o pay â€” P45,000.00 (P25,000[.00] mo. salary &amp; P20,000[.00] [overriding])<br>b)&nbsp; Unpaid (overriding) commission from April 25, 2000 to present â€” P400,000[.00]<br>c)&nbsp; Unpaid salary from August 1, 2001 to present â€” P125,000[.00]<br>d)&nbsp; One mo. salary for every yr. of service in lieu of reinstatement â€” 7 years = P175,000.00<br></li><li>Leave Credits â€” P100,000.00 for 7 years<br></li><li> Profit Bonus for Year 2000 &amp; 2001 â€” P400,000.00<br></li><li>Moral Damages â€” P300,000.00<br></li><li>Exemplary Damages â€” P500,000.00<br></li><li>Actual Damages â€” for lifetime medical attendance and medicines at 16 more years life expectancy â€” P1,249,384.00<br></li><li>Attorney's Fees â€” P300,000.00<br></li><li>Amount debited from complainant's ATM [as partial payment for hospitalization expenses incurred by him which PPI had advanced] â€” P12,000.00<br></li><li>Retention of complainant's car, as additional penalty for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>For its part, PPI stressed that Caritas was its competitor in the pre-need plans business, and that Molina and his wife recruited and enticed some of the sales associates of PPI to work for Caritas, in violation of its policy against conflict of interest.&nbsp; Some of these sales associates were the spouses Eppie and Restie Acosta, Lenita Gatmaitan, Lolita Casaje, Lydia Magalso, Lydia San Miguel, and Alice Halili, and including Vilma del Rosario, the secretary of Roy Padiernos.&nbsp; PPI, likewise, averred that Molina had the habit of coming to the office under the influence of liquor; he constantly shouted to lady employees and solicited money from his sales associates in&nbsp; connection with an official company function without returning the same after PPI reimbursed him for the expenses incurred; disseminated intrigues and created divisiveness among the employees and PPI's senior officers; and disrespected Padiernos, his superior, by shouting at him during one of the meetings with other senior officers, and walked out of the meeting afterwards.&nbsp; Supporting its claims that Molina committed breach of trust, serious misconduct, fraud, and gross neglect of duty by reason thereof, PPI appended to its position paper the statements/affidavits of Marivic Uy, Ruth and Roy Padiernos, Eppie and Restie Acosta, Celeste Villena, and Vilma del Rosario. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On the claim of Molina that he was denied due process, PPI averred that he was given sufficient opportunity to present his personal submissions before finally issuing the notice of dismissal but Molina persistently refused to submit his explanation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> PPI further argued that he was not entitled to the payment of 13th and 14th month salaries, overriding commission, profit bonus, actual, moral or exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. PPI maintained that, under Article 217(a) of the Labor Code, as amended, and the ruling of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">BaÃ±ez v. Valdevilla,</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Molina should be held liable for P1,000,000 as moral damages and an amount not less than P428,400.00 for the salary he received during the time when the restraining order/ writ of injunction was erroneously enforced. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In his Reply, Molina averred that the affidavits submitted by PPI were antedated since he was never furnished copies of said reports/affidavits despite demands. PPI even failed to present the reports/affidavits before the RTC where his complaint for damages against PPI and its officers was pending. He and Roy Padiernos had been at odds because the latter appointed his brother and wife as agency manager and group manager of PPI to which he objected.&nbsp; Molina averred that the P200.00 collected from each of the employees of PPI during their luncheon meeting was a voluntary contribution, and that they spent P4,000.00, more than the amount collected from the employees. He contended that he had no motive to recruit sales associates or employees of PPI to be employed by Caritas because the depletion of sales associates would diminish his effectiveness as an area manager, including his overriding commission, profit bonus and fringe benefits.&nbsp; He admitted that he may have raised his voice in the heat of arguing a point during meetings, but averred that it should not be considered as disrespect or misdemeanor.<br><br>Molina further emphasized that Caritas was not a competitor of PPI, as the former was engaged in selling health care and is supervised by the Department of Health (DOH), while the latter is into the business of selling pre-need plans and supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Finally, he averred that the so-called "associates" of PPI were not actually employees but "independent journeymen" who derived income on commission basis, free to engage in any kind of selling activities not in direct competition with PPI.<br><br>Molina admitted having had drinking sessions with Certerio Uy, Ilustre Acosta and Reynaldo Villena, who provided the hard liquor and <span style="font-style: italic;">pulutan</span>, but only after office hours. He claimed that his officemates mistook him for being drunk when he went to his office even after office hours because of his "<span style="font-style: italic;">mestizo complexion.</span>"<br><br>In its response, PPI averred that, based on the sales data, the acts of Molina caused demoralization of the sales associates, resulting in a sudden decrease of the region's output from P343,009,643.00 in 1998 to P263,099,773.00 in 1999, and P228,752,090.00 in 2000. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; PPI insisted that he should be held liable for not less than P507,348.00, P2,000,000, and P1,000,000 as actual, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, respectively, and P273,600.00 which was the balance on his car plan agreement with PPI. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In his Rejoinder <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and Sur-Rejoinder <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Molina submitted the affidavit of Geoffrey Martinez, who belied the reports of Uy, Villena, Del Rosario, and the spouses Padiernos and Acosta. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; He also appended the affidavits of Natividad Gatchalian, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> San Miguel, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Gatmaitan, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and Magalso, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> who all disputed, in one way or another, Molina's alleged violations.&nbsp; To counter the imputations of conflict of interest, Molina also alleged that Abia and Atty.&nbsp; Reyes were incorporators of Caritas, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and that Villena had in her possession a license to sell Caritas products. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; With regard to the declining sales output of his region, Molina attributed the same to the Asian regional crisis that hit the Philippines sometime in 1997.&nbsp; He noted, however, that the same records revealed that despite the financial bane, Metro VI still managed to be on top from 1998 up to 2000 in terms of its sales relative to the other regions.<br><br>Molina denied any liability for the car plan, claiming that he already settled the obligation when PPI demanded full payment as, in fact, all the papers related thereto, including the Release of Mortgage, were already in his possession.<br><br>In its Sur-Rejoinder, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> PPI stressed its claim that Caritas was a business competitor, as may be inferred from the benefits available under its health care agreement and the pre-need contract of PPI.&nbsp; Particularly with regard to the pension plan contract, it noted the following similarities:&nbsp; (a) Caritas also provides Term Life Insurance, Accidental Death Insurance, Credit Life Insurance, and Waiver of Installment Due to Disability;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) there are similarities in the provisions on contract price, grace period, cancellation, reinstatement, and transfer and termination; and (c) unlike other health care programs that provide a one-year coverage, renewable every year thereafter, Caritas offers a continuous five year coverage and sells the same in units payable in five-year installment basis, with maturity period and guaranteed return of investment in the form of Full-Term Medical Expense Fund computed at P10,000.00 for every unit purchased with increment of 10% yearly after the maturity period, which may be withdrawn in cash by its member.&nbsp; It stressed that this was similar to the pension program offered by PPI which was also sold in per unit basis, payable by installment in certain number of years or lump sum payment, and upon maturity also gives P10,000.00 pension benefit per unit purchased by the plan holder. With respect to the alleged interest of Atty. Reyes with Caritas, PPI adduced in evidence a Deed of Sale to prove that as early as February 1999 he had already divested his stockholdings in Caritas. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>On November 18, 2002, Labor Arbiter Roma C. Asinas rendered a Decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dismissing the complaint and the counterclaims for lack of merit.&nbsp; The labor arbiter ruled that Molina was lawfully dismissed from his employment for serious misconduct in office and fraud or willful breach of trust and confidence. It declared that Molina's mere denial of the charges against him did not overthrow the overwhelming evidence against him tending to show that he committed the allegations against him. Moreover, his wife was then an agency manager of Caritas, and some PPI sales associates were with Caritas because they were recruited by Molina. The labor arbiter also ruled that other employees of respondent attested to the fact that they were being recruited and enticed by the complainant to join Caritas. This act of pirating constituted serious misconduct in office, fraud or willful breach of trust and confidence, which are just causes for termination of employment under Article 282 of the Labor Code, as amended. As such, PPI could not legally be compelled to continue Molina's employment due to breach of trust.<br><br>The labor arbiter likewise held that Molina was afforded his right to due process, but that he refused to give an answer to the charges leveled against him, and instead insisted that he be furnished a copy of the alleged reports against him.&nbsp; Since he was given ample opportunity to answer the charges and explain his side during the investigation, and a formal or trial-type hearing is not at all times essential, Molina's right to due process was not violated. The labor arbiter stressed that the requirements of due process are satisfied where the parties are afforded fair and reasonable opportunity to explain their side of the controversy at hand. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Molina appealed the decision to the NLRC, which rendered judgment in his favor.&nbsp; The NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and ordered Molina's immediate reinstatement to his former position as Assistant Vice President without demotion in rank and salary; and the payment of his backwages from August 1, 2001 up to his actual reinstatement, and other accrued monetary benefits.

The Head of the Legal Division of the respondent, Atty. Reyes, was also an incorporator of Caritas and a member of its Board of Directors, and although he appears to have sold his shares to Herminigildo C.

The so-called sales associates of the respondent are non-salaried employees and are paid on commission basis only.&nbsp; Their commissions are based on their individual initiative and industry. That the contracts executed by the beneficiaries of both corporations have similar provisions regarding contract price, grace period, cancellation, reinstatement, transfer and termination, do not constitute proof that Caritas and respondent are business competitors.&nbsp; There is also no proof that the two corporations compete with each other in the same or similar business; in fact, the business of Caritas and that of the respondent complement each other.<br><br>Respondent relied on the declarations of Ruth Padiernos, Spouses Eppie and Ilustre Acosta, Celeste Villena, and Marivic Uy to prove its charge that Fe Molina pirated sales associates working for respondent and that petitioner tolerated the actuations of his wife and even connived with her.<br><br>The Court finds, however, that the evidence adduced by respondent insufficient to warrant the petitioner's dismissal from employment.<br><br>Ruth Padiernos, wife of Roy Padiernos, averred in her written statement dated March 8, 2000, that as far back as July 1999, she had a conference with her husband and Abia where she reported that petitioner connived with his wife in pirating sales associates.
