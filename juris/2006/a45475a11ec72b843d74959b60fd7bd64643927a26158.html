				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For stock corporations, the "quorum" referred to in Section 52 of the Corporation Code is based on the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">outstanding voting</span> stocks.

The first assailed Resolution dismissed the appeal filed by petitioners with the CA.  Allegedly, without the proper authorization of the other petitioners, the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping were signed by only one of them -- Atty.

Out of the eleven, seven (7)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> attended the meeting through their respective proxies.  The meeting was convened and chaired by Atty. Sabino Padilla Jr. over the objection of Atty. Antonio C. Pacis, who argued that there was no quorum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  In the meeting, Petitioners Ernesto Tanchi, Edwin Ngo, Virginia Khoo, and Judith Tan were voted to replace the four deceased member-trustees.<br><br>When the controversy reached the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), petitioners maintained that the deceased member-trustees should not be counted in the computation of the quorum because, upon their death, members automatically lost all their rights (including the right to vote) and interests in the corporation.<br><br>SEC Hearing Officer Malthie G. Militar declared the April 6, 1998 meeting null and void for lack of quorum.  She held that the basis for determining the quorum in a meeting of members should be their number as specified in the articles of incorporation, not simply the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">living </span>members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She explained that the qualifying phrase "entitled to vote" in Section 24<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the Corporation Code, which provided the basis for determining a quorum for the election of directors or trustees, should be read together with Section 89.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The hearing officer also opined that Article III (2)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the By-Laws of GCHS, insofar as it prescribed the mode of filling vacancies in the board of trustees, must be interpreted in conjunction with Section 29<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the Corporation Code.  The SEC en banc denied the appeal of petitioners and affirmed the Decision of the hearing officer in toto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It found to be untenable their contention that the word "members," as used in Section 52<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the Corporation Code, referred only to the <span style="font-style: italic;">living </span>members of a nonstock corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>As earlier stated, the CA dismissed the appeal of petitioners, because the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping had been signed only by Atty.

Subsequently, however, petitioners submitted a Special Power of Attorney, attesting that Atty.

As owners, though, the stockholders or members have residual powers over fundamental and major corporate changes. <br><br>While stockholders and members (in some instances) are entitled to receive profits, the management and direction of the corporation are lodged with their representatives and agents -- the board of directors or trustees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In other words, acts of management pertain to the board; and those of ownership, to the stockholders or members.  In the latter case, the board cannot act alone, but must seek approval of the stockholders or members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Conformably with the foregoing principles, one of the most important rights of a qualified shareholder or member is the right to vote -- either personally or by proxy -- for the directors or trustees who are to manage the corporate affairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  The right to choose the persons who will direct, manage and operate the corporation is significant, because it is the main way in which a stockholder can have a voice in the management of corporate affairs, or in which a member in a nonstock corporation can have a say on how the purposes and goals of the corporation may be achieved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Once the directors or trustees are elected, the stockholders or members relinquish corporate powers to the board in accordance with law.<br><br>In the absence of an express charter or statutory provision to the contrary, the general rule is that every member of a nonstock corporation, and every legal owner of shares in a stock corporation, has a right to be present and to vote in all corporate meetings. Conversely, those who are not stockholders or members have no right to vote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  Voting may be expressed personally, or through proxies who vote in their representative capacities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Generally, the right to be present and to vote in a meeting is determined by the time in which the meeting is held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Section 52 of the Corporation Code states:<br><blockquote>"Section 52. Quorum in Meetings. – Unless otherwise provided for in this Code or in the by-laws, a quorum shall consist of the stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding capital stock or a majority of the members in the case of non-stock corporations."<br></blockquote>In stock corporations, the presence of a quorum is ascertained and counted on the basis of the <span style="font-style: italic;">outstanding capital stock</span>, as defined by the Code thus:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 137. <span style="font-style: italic;">Outstanding capital stock defined.</span> – The term "outstanding capital stock" as used in this Code, means the total shares of stock <span style="text-decoration: underline;">issued</span> under binding subscription agreements to subscribers or stockholders, whether or not fully or partially paid, except treasury shares."

Only stock <span style="font-style: italic;">actually</span> issued and outstanding may be voted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Under Section 6 of the Corporation Code, each share of stock is entitled to vote, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or declared delinquent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> under Section 67 of the Code. <br><br>Neither the stockholders nor the corporation can vote or represent shares that have never passed to the ownership of stockholders; or, having so passed, have again been purchased by the corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> These shares are not to be taken into consideration in determining majorities.  When the law speaks of a given proportion of the stock, it must be construed to mean the <span style="font-style: italic;">shares that have passed</span> from the corporation, and that may be voted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Section 6 of the Corporation Code, in part, provides:<br><blockquote>"Section 6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Classification of shares.</span> – The shares of stock of stock corporations may be divided into classes or series of shares, or both, any of which classes or series of shares may have such rights, privileges or restrictions as may be stated in the articles of incorporation: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided</span>, That no share may be deprived of voting rights except those classified and issued as "preferred" or "redeemable" shares, unless otherwise provided in this Code:  <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, further</span>, that there shall always be a class or series of shares which have complete voting rights.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x                            x x x                            x x x<br></div><br>"Where the articles of incorporation provide for non-voting shares in the cases allowed by this Code, the holders of such shares shall nevertheless be entitled to vote on the following matters:<br><ol><li>Amendment of the articles of incorporation;<br></li><li>Adoption and amendment of by-laws;<br></li><li>Sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of all or substantially all of the corporation property;<br></li><li>Incurring, creating or increasing bonded indebtedness;<br></li><li>Increase or decrease of capital stock;<br></li><li>Merger or consolidation of the corporation with another corporation or other corporations;<br></li><li>Investment of corporate funds in another corporation or business in accordance with this Code; and<br></li><li>Dissolution of the corporation.<br></li></ol>"Except as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, the vote necessary to approve a particular corporate act as provided in this Code shall be deemed to refer only to stocks with voting rights."<br></blockquote>Taken in conjunction with Section 137, the last paragraph of Section 6 shows that the intention of the lawmakers was to base the quorum mentioned in Section 52 on the number of outstanding voting stocks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">The Right to Vote in</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Nonstock Corporations</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><br>In nonstock corporations, the voting rights attach to membership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Members vote as persons, in accordance with the law and the bylaws of the corporation.  Each member shall be entitled to one vote unless so limited, broadened, or denied in the articles of incorporation or bylaws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> We hold that when the principle for determining the quorum for stock corporations is applied by analogy to nonstock corporations, only those who are <span style="font-style: italic;">actual</span> members with voting rights should be counted.<br><br>Under Section 52 of the Corporation Code, the majority of the members representing the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual</span> number of voting rights, not the number or numerical constant that may originally be specified in the articles of incorporation, constitutes the quorum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The March 3, 1986 SEC Opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> cited by the hearing officer uses the phrase "majority vote of the members"; likewise Section 48 of the Corporation Code refers to 50 percent of 94 (the <span style="font-style: italic;">number of registered</span> members of the association mentioned therein) plus one.  The best evidence of who are the <span style="font-style: italic;">present</span> members of the corporation is the "membership book"; in the case of stock corporations, it is the stock and transfer book.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Section 25 of the Code specifically provides that a majority of the <span style="font-style: italic;">directors or trustees, as fixed in the articles of incorporation,</span> shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of corporate business (unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws provide for a greater majority).  If the intention of the lawmakers was to base the quorum in the meetings of stockholders or members on their absolute <span style="font-style: italic;">number as fixed in the articles of incorporation</span>, it would have expressly specified so.  Otherwise, the only logical conclusion is that the legislature did not have that intention.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Effect of the Death</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">of a Member or Shareholder</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><br>Having thus determined that the quorum in a members' meeting is to be reckoned as the <span style="font-style: italic;">actual</span> number of members of the corporation, the next question to resolve is what happens in the event of the death of one of them.<br><br>In stock corporations, shareholders may generally transfer their shares. Thus, on the death of a shareholder, the executor or administrator duly appointed by the Court is vested with the legal title to the stock and entitled to vote it.  Until a settlement and division of the estate is effected, the stocks of the decedent are held by the administrator or executor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, membership in and all rights arising from a nonstock corporation are personal and non-transferable, unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation provide otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In other words, the determination of whether or not "dead members" are entitled to exercise their voting rights (through their executor or administrator), depends on those articles of incorporation or bylaws. <br><br>Under the By-Laws of GCHS, membership in the corporation shall, among others, be terminated by the death of the member.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Section 91 of the Corporation Code further provides that termination extinguishes all the rights of a member of the corporation, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws. <br><br>Applying Section 91 to the present case, we hold that dead members who are dropped from the membership roster in the manner and for the cause provided for in the By-Laws of GCHS are not to be counted in determining the requisite vote in corporate matters or the requisite quorum for the annual members' meeting.  With 11 remaining members, the quorum in the present case should be 6. Therefore, there being a quorum, the annual members' meeting, conducted with six<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> members present, was valid. <br><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Vacancy in the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Board of Trustees</span><br><br>As regards the filling of vacancies in the board of trustees, Section 29 of the Corporation Code provides:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 29. <span style="font-style: italic;">Vacancies in the office of director or trustee</span>. — Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors or trustees other than by removal by the stockholders or members or by expiration of term, may be filled by the vote of at least a majority of the remaining directors or trustees, if still constituting a <span style="font-style: italic;">quorum</span>; otherwise, said vacancies must be filled by the stockholders in a regular or special meeting called for that purpose.  A director or trustee so elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected only for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office."<br></blockquote>Undoubtedly, trustees may fill vacancies in the board, provided that those remaining still constitute a quorum.  The phrase "may be filled" in Section 29 shows that the filling of vacancies in the board by the remaining directors or trustees constituting a quorum is merely permissive, not mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Corporations, therefore, may choose how vacancies in their respective boards may be filled up -- either by the remaining directors constituting a quorum, or by the stockholders or members in a regular or special meeting called for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The By-Laws of GCHS prescribed the <span style="font-style: italic;">specific </span>mode of filling up existing vacancies in its board of directors; that is, by a majority vote of the remaining members of the board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>While a majority of the remaining corporate members were present, however, the "election" of the four trustees cannot be legally upheld for the obvious reason that it was held in an annual meeting of the members, not of the board of trustees.  We are not unmindful of the fact that the members of GCHS themselves also constitute the trustees, but we cannot ignore the GCHS bylaw provision, which specifically prescribes that vacancies in the board must be filled up by the remaining trustees.  In other words, these remaining member-trustees <span style="font-style: italic;">must sit as a board</span> in order to validly elect the new ones.<br><br>Indeed, there is a well-defined distinction between a corporate act to be done by the board and that by the constituent members of the corporation.  The board of trustees must act, not individually or separately, but as a body in a lawful meeting.  On the other hand, in their annual meeting, the members may be represented by their respective proxies, as in the contested annual members' meeting of GCHS.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is partly <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">GRANTED</span>.
