				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review assails the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated October 25, 2004 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 67640 which set aside the October 25, 1999 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 19, in Civil Case No. 431-M-97, as well as the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 27, 2005 denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>Emerenciana and Doroteo Espino, the parents of herein petitioner, Marcelina V. Espino, were the owners of two untitled parcels of land denominated as Lots 1475 and 1476, situated in Bambang, Bulacan and covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 96-05003-00447 and 96-05003-00449, respectively, with a total area of 134 square meters.&nbsp; On March 31, 1995, Emerenciana sold to Marissa Delos Santos a 20-square meter undivided portion of Lot 1475 for P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The crux of the controversy in this case arose from the execution by Emerenciana and Marcelina on January 9, 1997 of a document, denominated as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Pagkakaloob</span>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> purportedly donating Lots 1475 and 1476 to respondent Emma Vicente, the wife of Ricardo Vicente, nephew of Emerenciana.<br><br>It appears that sometime in December 1996, Emma convinced Marcelina and Emerenciana that she could facilitate the registration and titling in their name of the house and lot where they are staying. &nbsp;Emma allegedly asked Emerenciana and Marcelina who are both illliterate to sign a document to be used in titling the property in their name.<br><br>Subsequently, Emerenciana and Marcelina learned that the document they signed was a Deed of Donation or a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Pagkakaloob</span>," of the house and lot in favor of Emma, including the 20 square-meter portion that was earlier sold to Marissa. As a consequence, when Emma filed an application for free patent with the DENR-PENRO Office of Malolos, Bulacan on January 13, 1997, Marissa filed an opposition with the DENR-PENRO and the Register of Deeds. On the other hand, Emerenciana and Marcelina executed a Deed of Revocation of Donation or "<span style="font-style: italic;">Kasulatan ng Pagpapawalang Bisa sa Kasulatan ng Pagkakaloob</span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated April 14, 1997.<br><br>Petitioners then filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for annulment of patent/title and reconveyance of real property with damages with the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan which was docketed as Civil Case No. 431-M-97 and raffled to Branch 19.<br><br>After due proceedings, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which provides:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants as follows:<br><ol><li>The "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pagkakaloob</span>" Exhibit "E" of plaintiffs and Exhibit "1" of defendants is ordered ANNULLED and VOIDED by reason of fraud;<br><br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free Patent No. 031405-97-10063</span> issued by the DENR-PENRO of Malolos, Bulacan is declared by VOID AB INITIO;<br><br></li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax Declarations Nos. 96-05003-03502 &amp; 03503</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">96-05003-03506</span> dated January 15, 1997 and January 21, 1997, respectively, are declared VOID AB INITIO;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants TO PAY PLAINTIFFS the sum of TEN THOUSAND (P10,000.00) PESOS as and by way of attorney's fees; and<br><br></li><li> Costs of suit.<br></li></ol>All other claims of plaintiffs and defendants' counterclaim are DENIED for lack of legal and factual basis.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals which reversed the decision of the trial court and resolved the appeal as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and the complaint is DISMISSED. The Register of Deeds for the Province of Bulacan is directed to proceed with the registration of the property in the names of Marissa Delos Santos, as to an undivided 20 square-meter portion of lot 1475, and of the Spouses Emma and Ricardo Vicente, as to the remainder of lots 1475 and 1476.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence the present petition<br><br>The sole issue for resolution is whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the lower court's decision and concluding that the assailed deed of donation enjoys the legal presumption of due execution and validity.<br><br>Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals overlooked or disregarded certain factual findings of the trial court and that it failed to accord due evidentiary weight upon certain undisputed facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioners would want us to rule on questions of fact in resolving the issue they raised before us, contrary to the settled rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review. <br><br>Prefatorily, we restate the time honored principle that in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised. &nbsp;It is not our function to analyze or weigh all over again evidence already considered in the proceedings below, our jurisdiction being limited to reviewing only errors of law that may have been committed by the lower court. &nbsp;The resolution of factual issues is the function of the lower courts, whose findings on these matters are received with respect. &nbsp;A question of law which we may pass upon must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>However, this rule is not iron-clad. We have consistently recognized several exceptional circumstances where we disregarded the aforesaid&nbsp; tenet and proceeded to review the findings of facts of the lower court such as: (1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference is manifestly absurd, mistaken or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion&nbsp; in the appreciation of facts; (4) when the judgment is premised on a misapprehension of facts;&nbsp; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked&nbsp; certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties and which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; and (8) when the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court or are mere conclusions&nbsp; without citation of specific evidence, or where the facts set forth&nbsp; by the petitioner are not disputed&nbsp; by the respondent, or where the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on absence of evidence but are contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Considering the conflict in the factual findings of the Regional Trial Court and of the Court of Appeals, we rule on the factual issues as an exception to the general rule.<br><br>The petition is impressed with merit.<br><br>A donation is an act of liberality whereby a person disposes gratuitously a thing or right in favor of another, who accepts it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Like any other contract, an agreement of the parties is essential.&nbsp; Consent in contracts presupposes the following requisites: (1) it should be intelligent or with an exact notion of the matter to which it refers; (2) it should be free, and (3) it should be spontaneous.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; The parties' intention must be clear and the attendance of a vice of consent, like any contract, renders the donation voidable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>For the petitioners, the vice of consent which attended the execution of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Pagkakaloob</span> or the deed of donation came in the form of the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Emma in securing the signatures of Emerenciana and Marcelina.&nbsp; During her direct examination, Marcelina categorically testified that her signature and that of her deceased mother, Emerenciana, were procured by Emma through fraud and misrepresentation, thus:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Atty.

"A" of the plaintiffs. The central figure of the controversy Emma Vicente deliberately chose to waive her presence much less did she testify in Court to rebut the testimony of Marcelina. Her failure to testify is evidence against the defendants. Neither did the defendants present the witnesses to the "Pagkakaloob" nor the Notary Public, Atty. Cresenciano Santiago, so they could have controverted and refuted the repudiation made by Marcelina Espino. This failure is evidence against the defendants. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals anchored its assailed pronouncements on the fact that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Pagkakaloob</span> was notarized.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is true that deeds which have been notarized are presumed to have been duly executed, this presumption of regularity can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence as in this case.&nbsp; As earlier stated, the due execution of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Pagkakaloob</span> suffered from infirmities which derogate from the presumption of regularity that notarization attaches to it. &nbsp;Further, Marcelina testified that she never appeared before Cresenciano C. Santiago who allegedly notarized the <span style="font-style: italic;">Pagkakaloob</span>.<br><br>Anent the weight accorded by the Court of Appeals to the tax declarations in the names of the respondents and the realty tax receipts, we hold that while it is true that tax declarations and tax receipts are good indicia of possession in the concept of an owner, the same must be accompanied by possession for a period sufficient for prescription. By themselves, tax declarations and tax receipts do not conclusively prove ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; We have reviewed the records of this case and we find that even at the time of the filing of the application by respondent Emma Vicente for the issuance of a free patent over the subject property, the person occupying the same was Emerenciana Espino. Ireneo Guballa, a Public Land Inspector/Investigator of the CENRO, and a disinterested third party, testified that Emerenciana and Marcelina were the occupants of the property prior to and at the time that he conducted the ocular inspection on the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>. &nbsp;The assailed Decision dated October 25, 2004 and the May 27, 2005 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
