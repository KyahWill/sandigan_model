				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Accused-appellant Eduardo Taan @ Bebot was found guilty of murder aggravated by the use of an unlicensed firearm and sentenced to death in Criminal Case No. U-10383 in the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 19 July 2000 rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City, Branch 46.

Surprised, Taan told his godfather, Tacadena, "this is the one we are looking for, he was the one who robbed the school." Taan continued to say, "Take him, Ninong, Danny because I have been looking for that guy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Tacadena and Marquez took  hold  of  Ladaga  and carried him towards a mango tree. To force Ladaga  to  confess  to  the  crime of stealing, which he later did,<br><br>Marquez tied Ladaga's hands with a palm leaf while Taan held the latter's legs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Marquez then struck Ladaga's forehead with a big stone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Taan removed Ladaga's shirt to wipe the blood off the latter's face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> At around 8:00 p.m., Ladaga was brought inside Taan's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Afterwards, Taan asked Tacadena and Ruar to go home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Between midnight to 1:00 a.m.,  Marquez, who had with him a shovel, and Taan, armed with a gun, brought Ladaga to a two (2) foot-deep irrigation canal at Barangay Canarvacanan. Thereat, Ladaga was made to lie down and Taan poked a gun in his mouth and fired it four (4) times. Ochinang, then at the dike of the irrigation canal, about a meter away from the scene, witnessed the incident and how Taan buried Ladaga in the irrigation canal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Two days later, Taan summoned Ochinang to dig a deeper burial site for Ladaga because of the foul odor coming from the original gravesite. Nonetheless, it was Taan who dug a deeper site which was more or less six (6) meters from the original site. Taan removed Ladaga's body from the original gravesite and transferred it to the new excavation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On 14 September 1999, Ochinang reported the matter to the Central Intelligence Division Group (CIDG), Dagupan City. Thereat, he executed a sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> asserting Taan's authorship of the crime and indicating the place where Ladaga had been buried. Subsequently, Ladaga's body was recovered from the place pointed to by Ochinang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Dr. Danilo Rebugio, Municipal Health Officer of Laoac, Pangasinan, conducted an autopsy of the victim and made the following post-mortem findings, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><u>SIGNIFICANT EXTERNAL FINDINGS:</u><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-An [almost] decomposed body of a male cadaver.<br></div><br><u>SIGNIFICANT INTERNAL FINDINGS:</u><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">-Depressed Fracture; 3 cm. x 4 cm.; oblong in shape; mid-temporo-parietal area; Right.<br></div><br>-Fracture, 1 cm. in diameter, circular in shape, mid-posterior aspect of the hard palate, most probably of a gunshot wound entrance.<br><br>-Skull Fracture, 1.3 cm. in diameter, circular in shape, upper third of the occipital area, most probably of a gunshot wound exit, Right.<br><br>-Avulsion, teeth, Left and Right Lower Central Incissors [sic].<br><br>-Avulsion, tooth, Left Lateral Lower Incissor [sic].<br><br><u>CAUSE OF DEATH</u>: MASSIVE<br>INTRA-CRANIAL INJURIES MOST<br>PROBABLY SECONDARY TO GUNSHOT<br>WOUND.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The prosecution likewise presented a certification dated 25 April 2000 from the Firearms and Explosives Division of the PNP stating that Taan is "not a licensed/registered firearm holder of any kind and caliber per verification from available records with this office as of this date."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Taan, as sole witness for the defense, interposed the defense of denial. He alleged that Ochinang falsely accused him of the crime because he had previously imputed against the latter the stealing of three (3) of his uncle's goats and he had refused to help Ochinang in his bid for the position of <i>barangay kagawad</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Taan testified that on 18 July 1999, after attending a wedding celebration, he and Marlon Ruar went to Mariano's house and had a drinking session with Mariano, Rogelio Dumali, Romeo Pulido, Luding and Romeo Domaoal. While thereat, Taan saw Ochinang pulling a person whose identity Taan did not know and whose hands were tied with "buri." Taan and the rest of the group were shocked to see the person with a blackeye. Afterwards, Taan left for home with Marlon Ruar, Rogelio Dumali, Romeo Tacadena and Danny Marquez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>At his house, Taan again saw Ochinang with the person who had a blackeye and whose hands were tied with "buri." Taan asked who the person was. Ochinang replied that he is "[m]y nephew who is a theft [sic] whom I cannot control." Taan then ordered Ochinang and the man to leave to avoid involvement in the situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Several days after, Ochinang dropped by Taan's house while the latter was having a drink with Romeo Tacadena and Danny Marquez. Taan invited Ochinang to join them. Ochinang acceded. During their conversation, Taan asked Ochinang whether he had heard about the disappearance of the man he had previously been with. Ochinang, in response, told them not to talk anymore and to just keep silent. Taan and the group proceeded to tell Ochinang, "You again killed a person." Ochinang replied, "Just keep your cool and shut up your mouth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>Taan was found guilty as charged and the judgment of conviction was elevated to the Court for automatic review. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated 14 September 2004 of the Court in G.R. No. 145508,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the case was transferred to the Court of Appeals pursuant to the Court's ruling in <i>People v.  Efren Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Before the Court of Appeals, Taan argued that the trial court erred in: (1) convicting him of the crime of murder despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt; (2) giving full faith and credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses while completely ignoring the defense's evidence; (3) appreciating the aggravating circumstance of treachery where none existed; (4) sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death and to indemnify the heirs of Ladaga the sum of P75,000.00 as moral damages and another sum of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals in a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated 30 March 2005, in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00257, affirmed with modifications the decision of the trial court. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, The 19 July 2000 Decision of Branch 46, Regional Trial Court of Urdaneta City in Criminal Case No. U-10383, finding appellant Eduardo Taan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder and imposing upon him the penalty of death, is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that appellant is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay the heirs of the victim, Ricardo Ladaga, the amount  of  P50,000.00  as  civil  indemnity;  P75,000.00  as moral damages; P25,000.00 as exemplary damages; and P25,000.00 as temperate damages. Costs <i>de oficio</i>.<b><br><br>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>The Court of Appeals found no compelling reason to deviate from the trial court's observation that Ochinang was clear and categorical in identifying Taan as the assailant and that his testimony is sufficient to support a conviction.<br><br>Taan is now before the Court submitting for resolution the same matters argued before the Court of Appeals. Through his Manifestation and Motion dated 9 January 2006, Taan stated that there is no more necessity to file a supplemental brief and prayed that the case be resolved on the basis of the records and the brief earlier filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Earlier, the Office of the Solicitor General manifested that it was no longer filing a supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Court finds no reason to depart from the findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals. The Court affirms the judgment of conviction but reduces the sentence of death to reclusion perpetua.<br><br>Settled is the rule that the findings of facts of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonial evidence of the parties, its assessment of the  probative  weight  thereof  and  its  conclusions  anchored  on said findings are accorded great respect, if not conclusive effect, because of the unique advantage of the trial court in observing and monitoring at close range the conduct, demeanor and deportment of the witnesses as they gave their testimonies before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Unless it is shown that the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated certain facts and circumstances which if considered would have altered the outcome of the case, appellate courts are bound by the findings of facts of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The trial court gave credence and full probative value to the testimony of Ochinang. The trial court characterized Ochinang's testimony as "positive, categorical and straightforward."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The trial court also found Ochinang's testimony to be adequately supported by documentary evidence. Ochinang's testimony that Marquez struck Ladaga's face with a stone was confirmed by the Autopsy Report, to wit:<blockquote><u>SIGNIFICANT INTERNAL FINDINGS:<br><br></u>-Depressed Fracture; 3 cm. x 4 cm.; oblong in shape; mid-temporo- parietal area; Right.</blockquote>Ochinang's allegation that Taan put the barrel of the gun inside Ladaga's mouth and fired it, causing the latter's death, was likewise established by the Autopsy Report, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote><u>SIGNIFICANT INTERNAL FINDINGS:</u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>-Skull Fracture, 1.3 cm. in diameter, circular in shape, upper third  of the occipital area, most probably of a gunshot wound exit Right.</blockquote>Thus, leading the trial court to declare that:<blockquote>Between the positive, clear, unequivocal and specific declarations of Ochinang, who was in the company of the accused Taan and Marquez on July 18, 1999, and defense' contention that it could have been that the person who could have killed Ricardo Ladaga was Juanito Ochinang because of his reputation. The declaration of Ochinang prevails over the denial of Taan. The Court is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that it was Taan, with the assistance of Marquez, who inflicted injuries to the face of the victim. Likewise, Taan was the one who shot the victim by putting the barrel of his gun to the mouth of Ladaga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>Evidently, Ochinang testified in a clear and convincing manner leaving no room for doubt that indeed it was Taan who killed Ladaga.<br><br>That Ochinang's testimony is at variance with his Sworn Statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> does not persuade us to rule that Ochinang should be discredited as a witness. Taan points out that on the witness stand, Ochinang testified that after the drinking spree, he was with the rest of the group when they met Ladaga; while in his Sworn Statement, Ochinang stated that after parting ways with his drinking mates, he was about to cross a river by means of a foot bridge when he saw Taan and Marquez holding Ladaga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> We believe, however, that the alleged inconsistencies are trivial and insignificant and refer only to minor details and as such, do not impugn Ochinang's credibility. Discrepancies and/or inconsistencies between a witness's affidavit and testimony do not necessarily impair his credibility as affidavits are taken <i>ex parte</i> and are often incomplete or inaccurate for lack of or absence of searching inquiries by the investigating officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Between the ex-parte affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the latter commands greater weight particularly when the defense had the full opportunity to cross-examine the witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Next, Taan contends that Ochinang's failure to protect his relative, Ladaga, from harm and to immediately report the matter to Ladaga's family erode Ochinang's credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded. Ochinang testified that he had tried to stop Taan and Marquez from tying Ladaga's hands,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> but could not because Taan was holding a gun and he had taken shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Ochinang also implored Taan and Marquez four (4) times not to kill Ladaga to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The reason Ochinang failed to immediately report the incident to the authorities was his fear of Taan, who had warned him not to disclose the incident, and his several bodyguards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Pertinently, we have ruled in People v. Hernandez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that:<blockquote>Fear of reprisal and the natural reluctance of a witness to get involved in a criminal case are sufficient explanations for a witness' delay in reporting the crime to the authorities. Such failure in making a prompt report to the proper authorities does not destroy the truth per se of the complaint. Likewise, the natural hesitance of the witnesses in this country to volunteer information about a criminal case, and their unwillingness to be involved or dragged into a criminal investigation is common, and has been judicially declared not to affect their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote>The supposed grudge Ochinang had against Taan which provoked the filing of the criminal case is flimsy to be believed. Even assuming that the allegation were true, the existence of a grudge does not automatically render Ochinang's testimony bereft of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>All told, pitted against the categorical and positive testimony of Ochinang, Taan's defense of denial miserably fails. Denials, as negative and self-serving evidence, do not deserve as much weight in law as positive and affirmative testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Remarkably, Taan did not any present corroborating witness, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>. his drinking buddies, to strengthen his testimony that Ladaga, the previously unidentified individual who had a blackeye and whose hands were tied, was last seen with Ochinang.<br><br>With respect to the non-presentation of the subject firearm, such is not fatal to the prosecution of an illegal possession case as long as the existence thereof can be established by testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this case, Ochinang testified that he saw Taan in possession of a ".38 caliber revolver"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>   which the latter used to shoot Ladaga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Significantly, this was corroborated by the testimony of Dr. Rebugio, who conducted the post-mortem examination on Ladaga. He reported that Ladaga sustained a gunshot wound the entry of which is a hole 1.3 cm.  in diameter located in the mid-posterior aspect of the hard palate while the exit thereof is another hole 1.3 cm in diameter in the upper third of the occipital area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In qualifying the crime to murder, the trial court correctly appreciated the circumstance of treachery. For treachery to be considered, two (2) elements must concur:  (a) the employment of means of execution that give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and (b) the means of execution were deliberately or consciously adopted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Treachery clearly attended the killing   as   Ladaga,  pinned  down  by  Taan,  was  tipsy when he was killed, and thus was enfeebled and did not have full control of his senses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Previously, Ladaga's hands had been tied and his forehead had been struck with a stone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> With Marquez carrying a shovel and Taan armed with a gun, the unarmed, weakened Ladaga was clearly defenseless. The essence of treachery is that the attack comes without warning and in a swift, deliberate and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Article 248<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> prescribes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death for the crime of murder. Considering the qualifying circumstance of treachery and the aggravating circumstance of the use of an unlicensed firearm,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> which was proven through Ochinang's testimony and the Certification that Taan is not a licensed holder of a firearm, the proper imposable penalty would have been death. However, in view of the enactment of R.A. No. 9346 or the Act Prohibiting the Imposition of the Death Penalty, the penalty that should be imposed is <sub>reclusion perpetua</sub>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Regarding damages, when death occurs due to a crime, the following may be recovered: (1) civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> for the death of the victim; (2) actual or compensatory damages; (3) moral damages; (4) exemplary damages; (5) attorney's fees and expenses of litigation; and (6) interest, in proper cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>We affirm the monetary awards granted by the Court of Appeals but modify the awards of civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> to P75,000.00 and moral damages to P50,000.00 for the heirs of Ladaga, based on recent jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
