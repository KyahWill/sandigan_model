Case No. 5782-M, the awards for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, are DELETED;<br><br>In Civil Case No. 6734-M, the awards for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, are deleted; indemnity for death of P50,000.00 is additionally awarded; and the award for moral damages is reduced to P50,000.00;<br><br>In Civil Case No. 6769-M, the awards for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, are deleted; indemnity for death of P50,000.00 is additionally awarded; and the award for moral damages is reduced to P50,000.00;<br><br>In Civil Case No. 6935-M, the awards for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, are deleted; indemnity for death of P50,000.00 is additionally awarded; and the award for moral damages is increased to P50,000.00;<br><br>In Civil Case No. 6894-M, the awards for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, are deleted; and<br><br>In Civil Case No. 8478-M, the awards for exemplary damages, attorney's fees and litigation expenses, are deleted.<br><br>but in all other respects the appealed Decision is otherwise AFFIRMED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote>Aggrieved, petitioners are now before this Court impugning the judgment of the appellate court for the following reason:<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED AND ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN AFFIRMING WITH MODIFICATION ONLY AS TO DAMAGES THE APRIL 30, 2002 DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT BY OVERLOOKING CERTAIN FACTS WHICH MAY SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT THE RESOLUTION OF THE CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners insist that the prosecution failed to discharge its duty of establishing petitioner Manzanares' guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that the decisions both of the trial court and of the Court of Appeals were based only on mere assumptions.&nbsp; They pointed out that if it were true that petitioner Manzanares swerved farther to the left of the highway while he was overtaking, as found by the trial court, then, there was no reason why it still ended up on the asphalted portion of the highway.&nbsp; Moreover, they claim that petitioner Manzanares exercised caution before he proceeded to overtake the passenger jeepney on his side of the road by making sure that there was no oncoming vehicle on the opposite side of the highway.&nbsp; It was only after petitioner Manzanares was certain that he could successfully overtake that he did so but Jesus Basallo suddenly and unexpectedly maneuvered his passenger jeepney into the highway forcing petitioner Manzanares to apply the brakes of his truck. Unfortunately, the Isuzu truck skidded and rammed into the passenger jeepney driven by Jesus Basallo.&nbsp; Petitioners also impugn the reliance by the trial court and the Court of Appeals on the testimony of Dimapilis by claiming that the latter was a biased witness supplied by the parents of Ferdinand Exaltacion, one of the passengers who died because of the incident.<br><br>Petitioners also maintain that at the time of the incident, the passenger jeepney owned by Teodoro Basallo was not covered by any franchise to operate and that Jesus Basallo was driving with an expired license.&nbsp; Thus, under Article 2185 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Jesus Basallo is presumed negligent.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General filed its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and essentially maintained that this petition does not present any special and important reason that may justify the exercised of this Court's power of review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The petition is unmeritorious.<br><br>It is quite evident that the question as to who between petitioner Manzanares and Jesus Basallo was negligent in the operation of his vehicle is factual in nature justifying the outright rejection of this petition.&nbsp; As this court has repeatedly stressed in the majority of appeals in criminal cases, an appellate court gives great weight to the factual findings of trial courts and accords them respect if not finality unless the accused-appellant is able to show that the trial court overlooked or disregarded matters of substance which if considered would very likely change the results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioners plead with us to absolve them of any liability arising from the incident which occurred in the afternoon of 13 January 1983 by shifting the blame to the Jesus Basallo, the driver of the passenger jeepney involved in the incident.&nbsp; We have carefully reviewed the entire records of this case and failed to find any reason to rule in their favor.<br><br>We particularly take note of the inconsistency in petitioner Manzanares' stance as to what really caused him to abruptly step on his brakes while he was trying to pass the passenger jeepney then unloading its passengers in his side of the road.&nbsp; While he insists that he was compelled to apply his brakes when he saw Jesus Basallo's passenger jeepney move into the MacArthur Highway away from the shoulder to allow its passengers to disembark, he stated a different recollection of the incident

Such destruction could not have resulted had petitioner Manzanares been driving his truck slowly for then the impact would not have been as severe. As we have previously declared, "the very fact of speeding is indicative of imprudent behavior, as a motorist must exercise ordinary care and drive at a reasonable rate of speed commensurate with the conditions encountered, which will enable him or her to keep the vehicle under control and avoid injury to others using the highway."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Nor are we convinced that the Isuzu truck "voluntarily" swerved to the left of the highway.&nbsp; Such bare claim on the part of petitioner Manzanares' part amounts to nothing but an unsubstantiated and self-serving allegation.<br><br>Finally, as to petitioners' argument that Jesus Basallo should be presumed negligent because he was driving with an expired license and the passenger jeepney owned by his brother Teodorico did not have a franchise to operate, we hold that the same fails to convince.&nbsp; "The defense of contributory negligence does not apply in criminal cases committed through reckless imprudence, since one cannot allege the negligence of another to evade the effects of his own negligence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the present Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals' Decision dated 30 April 2002 affirming, with modification, the Decision dated 16 December 1994 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 7, Malolos, Bulacan is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez</i>, and <i>Callejo, Sr., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Roberto A.
