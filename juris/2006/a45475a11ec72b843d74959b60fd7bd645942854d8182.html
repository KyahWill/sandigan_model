				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In 1987, Virgilio Garcia, "founder" of petitioner corporations (the corporations), hired the then still single Annalisa Cortes (respondent) as clerk of the Rural Bank of Coron (Manila Office).<br><br>After Virgilio died, his son Victor took over the management of the corporations.<br><br>Anita Cortes (Anita), the wife of Victor Garcia, was also involved in the management of the corporations.  Respondent later married Anita's brother Eduardo Cortes.<br><br>Anita soon assumed the position of Vice President of petitioner Citizens Development Incorporated (CDI) and practically controlled the financial operations of almost all of the other corporations in the course of which she allowed some of her relatives and in-laws, including respondent, to hold several key sensitive positions thereat.<br><br>Respondent later became the Financial Assistant, Personnel Officer and Corporate Secretary of The Rural Bank of Coron, Personnel Officer of CDI, and also Personnel Officer and Disbursing Officer of The Empire Cold Storage Development Corporation (ECSDC). She simultaneously received salaries from these corporations.<br><br>On examination of the financial books of the corporations by petitioner Sandra Garcia Escat, a daughter of Virgilio Garcia who was previously residing in Spain, she found out that respondent was involved in several anomalies,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> drawing petitioners to terminate respondent's services on November 23, 1998 in petitioner corporations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>By letter of November 25, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> addressed to individual petitioners Caridad B.

It also noted that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reduction of Bond</span> was "premised on self-serving allegations." It accordingly dismissed the appeal.<br><br>Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> was denied by the NLRC by November 26, 2001 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> hence, they filed a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>By Decision dated May 26, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>, the appellate court dismissed the petition for lack of merit.

Movilla</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  instructs that a corporation can engage its corporate officers to perform services under a circumstance which would make them employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Labor Arbiter has thus jurisdiction over respondent's complaint.<br><br>On the first three assigned errors which bear on whether petitioners' appeal before the NLRC was perfected:<br><br>As before the Court of Appeals, petitioners cite <span style="font-style: italic;">Cosico, Jr. v. NLRC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Taberrah v. NLRC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in support of their contention that their appeal before the NLRC was perfected.  As correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, however, the cited cases are not in point.<br><blockquote>... The appellant in <span style="font-style: italic;">Taberrah</span> filed a motion to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fix</span> appeal bond instead of posting an appeal bond; and the Supreme Court relaxed the requirement considering that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">labor arbiter's decision did not contain a computation of the monetary award</span>. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Cosico</span>, the appeal bond posted was of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">insufficient amount</span> but the Supreme Court ruled that provisions of the Labor Code on requiring a bond on appeal involving monetary awards must be given liberal interpretation in line with the desired objective of resolving controversies on their merits. Herein, <span style="font-weight: bold;">no appeal bond, whether sufficient or not, was ever filed by the petitioners</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners additionally cite <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel Handicraft v. NLRC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to support their position that there is a distinction between the filing of an appeal within the reglementary period and its perfection. In the parallel case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Computer Innovations Center v. National Labor Relations Commission</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court hesitated to reiterate the doctrine in <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span> in this wise:<br><blockquote>Petitioners invoke the aforementioned holding in <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span> that there is a distinction between the filing of an appeal within the reglementary period and its perfection, and that the appeal may be perfected after the said reglementary period. Indeed, <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span> held that the filing of a motion for reduction of appeal bond necessarily stays the reglementary period for appeal. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, in this case, the motion for reduction of appeal bond</span> which was incorporated in the appeal memorandum, ,was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filed only on the tenth or final day of the reglementary period</span>. Under such circumstance, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the motion for reduction of appeal bond can no longer be deemed to have stayed the appeal, and the petitioner faces the risk, as had happened in this case, of summary dismissal of the appeal for non-perfection</span>.<br><br>Moreover, the reference in <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span> to the distinction between the period to file the appeal and to perfect the appeal has been pointedly made only once by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gensoli v. NLRC</span> thus, it has not acquired the sheen of venerability reserved for repeatedly-cited cases. The distinction, if any, is not particularly evident or material in the Labor Code; hence, the reluctance of the Court to adopt such doctrine. Moreover, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the present provision in the NLRC Rules of Procedure,</span> that "the filing of a motion to reduce bond shall not stop the running of the period to perfect appeal" <span style="font-weight: bold;">flatly contradicts the notion expressed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span> that there is a distinction between the filing an appeal and perfecting an appeal</span>.<br><br>Ultimately, the disposition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span> was premised on the ruling that a motion for reduction of the appeal bond necessarily stays the period for perfecting the appeal, and that the employer cannot be expected to perfect the appeal by posting the proper bond until such time the said motion for reduction is resolved. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The unduly stretched-out distinction between the period to file an appeal and to perfect an appeal was not material to the resolution of <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Angel</span>, and this could be properly considered as <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter dictum</span>.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The appellate court did not thus err in dismissing the petition before it.  And contrary to petitioners' assertion, the appellate court dismissed its petition not "on a mere technicality."  For the non-posting of an appeal bond within the reglementary period divests the NLRC of its jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.  Thus, in the same case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Computer Innovations Center</span>, this Court held:<br><blockquote>Petitioners also characterize the appeal bond requirement as a technical rule, and that the dismissal of an appeal on purely technical grounds is frowned upon. However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Article 223, which prescribes the appeal bond requirement, is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rule of jurisdiction</span> and not of procedure</span>. There is a little leeway for condoning a liberal interpretation thereof, and certainly none premised on the ground that its requirements are mere technicalities. It must be emphasized that there is no inherent right to an appeal in a labor case, as it arises solely from grant of statute, namely the Labor Code.<br><br>We have indeed held that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">requirement for posting the surety bond</span> is not merely procedural but <span style="font-weight: bold;">jurisdictional</span> and cannot be trifled with. Non-compliance with such legal requirements is fatal and has the effect of rendering the judgment final and executory. The petitioners cannot be allowed to seek refuge in a liberal application of rules for their act of negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It bears emphasis that all that is required to perfect the appeal is the posting of a bond to ensure that the award is eventually paid should the appeal be dismissed.  Petitioners should thus have posted a bond, even if it were only partial, but they did not.  No relaxation of the Rule may thus be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioner did not post a <span style="font-weight: bold;">full</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">partial</span> appeal bond within the prescribed period, thus, no appeal was perfected</span> from the decision of the Labor Arbiter. For this reason, the decision sought to be appealed to the NLRC had become final and executory and therefore immutable. Clearly then, the NLRC has no authority to entertain the appeal, much less to reverse the decision of the Labor Arbiter. Any amendment or alteration made which substantially affects the final and executory judgment is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, including the entire proceeding held for that purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33] </sup>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As the decision of the Labor Arbiter had become final and executory, a discussion of the fourth and fifth assigned errors  is no longer necessary.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Position Paper of herein petitioners, NLRC records, 54-55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The letter (NLRC records, p. 46) which was signed by petitioners Caridad B.
