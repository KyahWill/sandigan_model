				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This administrative complaint stemmed from a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> report</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">dated June 13, 2002</span> submitted by an audit team from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) which conducted a judicial audit and physical inventory of cases in the Municipal Trial Court in Cities, San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan (MTCC-SJDM) from January 30, 2002 to February 15, 2002.  The audit was done in response to a referral from the Technical Staff of the Department of Justice forwarding to OCA a letter from a <span style="font-style: italic;">"Bantay Bayan"</span> member requesting an investigation of alleged anomalies and irregularities perpetrated by then <span style="font-weight: bold;">Judge Ricardo P. Liwanag</span>, presiding judge, MTCC-SJDM, in collusion with two members of his staff, namely, <span style="font-style: italic;">clerk of court</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">J. Rogelio T. Montero III</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">court interpreter</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ma. Corazon D. Española.</span><br><br>At the start of its investigation, the audit team complained of the lack of cooperation on the part of respondents Montero III and Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola. After its investigation, the team reduced its findings <span style="font-style: italic;">via</span> its aforementioned report of June 13, 2002.  In said report, the team found respondents Montero III and Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola responsible for the following: (1) sorry state of case management in the subject court; (2) some court exhibits were either missing or released under suspicious circumstances; and (3) questionable release of cash bonds to persons other than the accused.<br><br>In the same report, the team detailed the shoddy record- keeping in MTCC-SJDM, as follows:<br><blockquote>The team underwent a hard time in conducting the audit. The Court has not submitted the required monthly report and semestral inventory of cases since the year 2000 up to the present. There is no effective method of filing of cases.  Pending cases are mixed with dismissed, decided and archived cases.  There was no compliance with the required actual and physical inventory of cases every semester.  The docket books are not updated.<br><br>The return of service of each and every case as well as the minutes of every order are not attached to or are nowhere to be found in the records.  The exhibits are just placed at one corner of the room and are unprotected from the elements.<br><br>The Clerk of Court is not even aware of the status of the cases when asked by the team.  He did not even bother to define the duties and responsibilities of his staff especially on matters of receiving pleadings or other papers.  There was no designation of employees who will take charge of the criminal and civil cases.<br><br>At once, after going over the records of the available cases and considering the uncooperative or lackadaisical attitude of Clerk of Court Rogelio T. Montero III and the previous Officer-in-Charge, Ma. Corazon D. Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola, Court Interpreter, the team got the impression that there is truth to the allegations of anomalies and irregularities in the court.  In fact, Ms. Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola even skipped reporting to office for almost two (2) weeks during the audit after she failed to answer the various questions concerning the status of cases.<br></blockquote>The team also reported that exhibits consisting of guns, ammunitions and gambling machines were missing from the court files. Respondent Montero III, when asked during the audit to account for the exhibits, failed to produce the following, to wit: <br><br><table style="width: 75%;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td> <br></td><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: left;">Criminal Case <br></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No. </div></td><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;" valign="top">Exhibits</td></tr><tr><td width="5%"> <br></td><td width="32%"> <br></td><td width="63%"> <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1.</td><td valign="top">0393-01</td><td rowspan="2" valign="top">.22 cal.

We quote from the same report:<br><blockquote>There are various criminal cases which were dismissed by the court based on alleged "Pag-urong ng Habla" purportedly executed by the private complainant but comparison of the signature in the said documents with the "Sinumpaang Salaysay" executed before the police authorities readily shows that the signature in the "Pag-uurong" (sic) was forged.  Likewise, there are discrepancies in the signatures of the accused appearing on "Cash Bailbond Undertaking" and those appearing on the vouchers for the release of the cash bond to the accused after the cases were dismissed.  This indicates that the cash released after dismissal of the cases was pocketed by persons other than the accused.<br><br>Some of the said cases are the following:<br><br><table style="width: 85%;" ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td>Case No.</td><td>Accused </td><td>Nature</td></tr><tr><td> <br></td><td> <br></td><td> <br></td></tr><tr><td>1. 1024-00</td><td>Francis D.V.

Bellosillo, Acting Court Administrator Jose Perez informed the Court of the report of the audit team.<br><br>In a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resolution</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">dated July</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">17, 2002</span>, the Court, thru its Third Division, considered the report of the audit team, then docketed as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Administrative Matter No. 02-6-150-MTCC</span>, as a regular administrative complaint against the respondents and placed all three of them under preventive suspension, requiring them to submit their COMMENT on the report of the audit team.  In the same resolution, the Court referred the complaint to Executive Judge Oscar Herrera, Jr. of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City, Bulacan for investigation, report and recommendation. The Court also designated Rodelio Marcelo as acting clerk of court of MTCC-SJDM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Mr. Marcelo was formerly the clerk of court of the Municipal Trial Court at Angat, Bulacan who was assigned to MTCC-SJDM on September 14, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>From <span style="font-weight: bold;">Administrative Matter No. 02-6-150-MTCC</span>, the report of the audit team was redocketed as  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Administrative Matter No. MTJ-02-1440</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola submitted her comment on September 30, 2002 while Judge Liwanag and Montero III submitted theirs on October 8 and 10, 2002, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In his letter-report dated    February 14, 2003, MTCC-SJDM's acting clerk of court Rodelio Marcelo informed Atty.

In another <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resolution dated June 16, 2003</span>, the Court referred the administrative complaint against the respondents to Judge Guillermo Agloro who had replaced Judge Herrera as Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City, Bulacan. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the memorandum she submitted during the investigation conducted by Judge Agloro, respondent Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola claimed that she could not be held responsible for the poor court management in the subject court. When respondent Montero III took a study leave from May 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000 to prepare for the bar examinations, Judge Liwanag designated Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola <span style="font-style: italic;">officer-in-charge</span> of MTCC-SJDM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola explained that while she was the <span style="font-style: italic;">officer-in-charge</span> of MTCC-SJDM during the period that respondent Montero III was on leave,  the preparation of monthly reports and the semestral inventory of cases were assigned by Judge Liwanag to Mr. Marcelo. Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola placed squarely the responsibility on MTCC-SJDM's failure to file the required reports on the shoulders of Mr. Marcelo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Also, respondent Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola justified her absence during the conduct of the judicial audit, explaining that she had to file a leave of absence for four (4) days, from February 5-8, 2002, to attend the hearing of an administrative case against her docketed as A.M. OCA IPI No. 99-65-P entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">"Marquina vs. Corazon Espa</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">ñ</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">ola"</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic)</span> scheduled on February 6, 2002 at the Office of the Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos City, Bulacan.

According to the investigating judge, Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola should have met with the audit team, even if just to inform it of her need to go on leave to attend to the administrative case against her, and Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola's failure to do so showed her lack of intent to cooperate with the audit team.<br><br>Judge Agloro gave little weight to respondent Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola's excuse that the duty to submit the required monthly reports and semestral inventory of cases rested not on her, but on Mr. Marcelo. Judge Agloro noted that as the designated <span style="font-style: italic;">officer-in-charge</span> of MTCC-SJDM during the absence of respondent Montero III, it was Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola's duty to file the required reports and docket inventories for MTCC-SJDM.<br><br>For his defense, respondent Montero III maintained in the memorandum he submitted during the investigation that had the audit team inquired from a certain Cresencia Reyes, a clerk in MTCC-SJDM, it would have known that the monthly reports until May, 2002 had already been submitted.  As to the submission of the semestral inventory of cases, respondent Montero III admitted the truth of the audit team's findings that he failed to submit the required inventory reports for MTCC-SJDM for 2000-2002. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Judge Agloro held that the absence of an effort from respondent Montero III to show proof of compliance with the reportorial requirements was an indication of said respondent's failure, amounting to serious misconduct, to perform his duties under the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>, to wit:<br><blockquote>2.2.4.

Her contention that the non-submission of the monthly reports of cases and semestral docket inventories for MTCC-SJDM should not be blamed on her is unacceptable.  From the time she assumed the position of <span style="font-style: italic;">officer-in-charge</span> of MTCC-SJDM, it became her duty to ensure that MTCC-SJDM complied with its reportorial requirements.  The total absence of any effort on her part to fulfill such duty illustrates her inefficiency and utter lack of competence. Under  subsection A(16) of Section 52 of Rule IV of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,</span> respondent Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola's infraction is considered a grave offense punishable by suspension of six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year on the first offense.<br><br>After conducting his investigation, Judge Agloro found no sufficient evidence to allocate among the respondents the blame for the alleged anomalous release of cash bail bonds.  The need for further investigation on this matter, as suggested by Judge Agloro in his report, is already mooted by our imposition of the supreme penalty of dismissal on respondents Judge Liwanag and Montero III.  As regards respondent Espa<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ñ<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>ola, the Court feels that she should be spared of another investigation on a matter which was within the scope of Judge Agloro's inquiry.  Also mooted is the recommendation of Judge Agloro to transfer Mr. Marcelo, acting clerk of court of MTCC-SJDM. In its <span style="font-weight: bold;">Resolution</span> dated <span style="font-weight: bold;">June 27, 2005</span>, the Court revoked his designation as acting clerk of court of MTCC-SJDM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, respondent <span style="font-weight: bold;">J.
