				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before Us is a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari </span>seeking the reversal of the Decision dated 23 February 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Resolution dated 27 September 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 50771 entitled, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Antonio G. Diaz and Francisco P. Tesorero v. Energy Regulatory Board and Davao Light &amp; Power Co., Inc.</span>"  The assailed Decision and Resolution imputed grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Energy Regulatory Board<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (ERB) for altering the cut-off date from 18 September 1989 to 14 December 1984 for the purpose of computing consumers' refund.<br><br>Petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> is the authorized operator of electric light, heat, and power services in Davao City and in the municipalities of Panabo, Sto. Tomas, and Carmen, all situated in the province of Davao del Norte.<br><br>Respondents Antonio Diaz and Francisco Tesorero are consumers of the electric power supplied by petitioner and are therefore the latter's customers.<br><br>On 24 June 1982, petitioner filed an application with the then Board of Energy (BOE) for the approval of the sound value appraisal of its properties, assets, and equipment in service as of 9 October 1981.  In its application, initially docketed as BOE Case No. 82-684 and re-docketed as ERB Case No. 91-181, petitioner pegged the sound value appraisal of its properties, assets, and equipment in the amount of P302,109,000.00.  The BOE, in its Decision dated 6 December 1983, reduced this amount to P282,024,877.40.<br><br>Still unsatisfied with the BOE's action, respondents Diaz and Tesorero filed a Petition for Review on <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> before this Court seeking the annulment of the 6 December 1983 decision of the BOE.  Said petition was docketed as G.R. No. 69592<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and, on 8 May 1990, we modified the BOE's decision by further reducing the sound value appraisal of petitioner's properties, assets, and equipment in service as of 9 October 1981 from P282,024,877.40 to P122,175,433.40.  We likewise denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration in our Resolution dated 27 June 1990.<br><br>On 9 October 1985, while G.R. No. 69592 was still pending with this Court, petitioner filed another application before the BOE for the approval of the sound value appraisal of its properties, assets, and equipment in service as of 14 December 1984.  This second application was docketed as BOE Case No. 85-103 and re-docketed as ERB Case No. 87-70.<br><br>On 18 September 1989, the ERB rendered a decision approving petitioner's sound value appraisal for its properties, assets, and equipment in service as of 14 December 1984 at P420,606,811.82, thus:<br><blockquote>After a judicious evaluation of the records of the case, the Board finds the herein application of Davao Light &amp; Power Co., Inc. for approval of the sound value appraisal of its properties and equipment in service as of December 14, 1984, to be meritorious.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Board hereby approves the revaluation and appraisal, as modified herein, of the property and equipment of Davao Light &amp; Power Co., Inc. with a total cost of

Such exclusion must necessarily reduce the sound value of petitioner's allowable rate base and ultimately result in the reduction of the rate of return, which is limited by law to twelve percent (12%) of the rate base.  While it cannot be disclaimed that petitioner's rates were fixed by the then Board of Energy (BOE) (now the Energy Regulatory Board) in prior orders, respondent ERB, however, is not without authority to order refund proceedings in the light of the ruling in the aforecited <span style="font-style: italic;">Tesorero</span> case.  Such refund proceedings, however, must take into account the overriding principle of fairness which stems from the all-important fact that public utilities such as the petitioner DALIGHT make their financial plans, projections and investments on the basis of the expected revenues.

Moreover, it has been the uniform practice of the ERB to set the effective date of revaluation of power utilities' assets in service as of a specific date and not on the date of the promulgation of its decision.  This practice, petitioner argues, is recognized even by respondents themselves when they stated in their motion for reconsideration dated 8 April 1998 in ERB Case No. 91-181 that it has been customary for COA to compute the rate base on the basis of the latest appraisal which is recorded in the books even prior to the approval of the said appraisal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>As for the dispositive portion of the ERB's decision of 18 September 1989, petitioner maintains that the same is vague because the body of the decision clearly states that the approved valuation of petitioner's assets is supposed to take effect on 14 December 1984 and not on the date of the promulgation of said decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondents insist that the present petition failed to raise a question of law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals with respect to which copy of the 26 February 1998 ERB order should be relied upon binds this Court.<br><br>We find merit in the petition.<br><br>It is well recognized that a public utility such as petitioner is entitled to a reasonable compensation in return for the service it provides and that it may exact reasonable charges in accordance with the service provided or the rates established therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  In computing the just and reasonable rates to be charged by a public utility, three major factors are to be considered.  These are:  the rate of return; the rate base; and the return itself or the computed revenue to be earned by the public utility based on the rate of return and rate base.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  The rate of return is a percentage which when multiplied by the rate base provides a fair return to the public utility for the use and risks it undertook for the investment of its money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  The rate of return in our jurisdiction has been set at 12% by administrative and judicial pronouncements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  The rate base refers to the total amount of invested capital or of property "values" on which the public utility is entitled to a reasonable rate of compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  It includes an allowance for working capital in addition to the net valuation of the utility's tangible property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  The valuation of a public utility's assets is an integral portion of the rate base.<br><br>In this case, respondents argue that the sound value appraisal of petitioner's properties, assets, and equipment in use as of 14 December 1984 must be made to apply even five years after the appraisal was conducted or on 18 September 1989.  We cannot agree with such proposition.<br><br>Appraisal is defined as a valuation or an estimation of value of property <span style="font-style: italic;">as of a given date</span> by disinterested persons of suitable qualifications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  It must be emphasized that in conducting the appraisal of a property, one seeks to determine its worth at a specific time; thus, its value varies as the reckoning period changes.  Respondent's view that the sound value appraisal of petitioner's properties, assets, and equipment in service as of 14 December 1984 should be the same as its valuation almost five years after overlooks a basic and generally held concept that assessment of these items change over time such that some of them may have depreciated while the valuation of the others might have appreciated.  Either way, the values of the properties will no longer be the same particularly in this case where the period separating the date of appraisal and the date of the ERB decision is almost five years.  Surely, by the time the ERB came up with its decision in 1989 approving the sound value appraisal of petitioner's properties in service as of 1984, their values are no longer the same.<br><br>We likewise find respondents' reliance on the dispositive portion of the 18 September 1989 decision of the ERB stating that said decision was "to take effect on the date hereof" to be unacceptable.<br><br>While are aware that the portion of a decision that becomes the subject of execution is that ordained or decreed in the dispositive part thereof nevertheless, we are equally conscious of the exceptions to this rule, to wit:<br><blockquote>(a) where there is ambiguity or uncertainty, the body of the opinion may be referred to for purposes of construing the judgment because the dispositive part of a decision must find support from the decision's <span style="font-style: italic;">ratio decidendi</span>;<br><br>(b) where extensive and explicit discussion and settlement of the issue is found in the body of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>A reading of the whole 18 September 1989 decision of the ERB reveals that it refers to the estimated values of petitioner's properties as of 14 December 1984 and that the factors used by the independent appraiser in the valuation were those existing at the time they conducted the appraisal and not when the ERB rendered its decision a few years after, thus:<br><blockquote>At the February 22 &amp; 23, 1988 hearings, applicant presented as its final witness, Engr.

ERB</span> decision, one of the variables taken into consideration in the fixing of rates of public utilities is the rate base, which is made up of the value of properties in service plus two months working capital.  With respect to the properties in service, the present or sound value is used, conformably with rulings of the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Manila Electric Company vs. Public Service Commission</span> (18 SCRA 651 at 667-669)  and a long line of earlier cases cited therein.<br><br>It is precisely in this context that DALIGHT sought the approval by the Board of the sound value appraisal of its properties in service as of December 14,1984, and the same context in which the Board's approval was granted.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In other words, the Board through the said decision, confirmed that the sound value of DALIGHT's properties in service on December 14, 1984 was P420,606,811.82.<br><br>In a technical, as well as practical sense, the P420,606,811.82 valuation and the value date, December 14, 1984, have to go together.  Should such date be changed, the value of the properties would almost certainly be likewise different.<br><br>It is in this perspective that the time frame of the refund should be determined particularly the ending cut-off date thereof.<br><br>Viewed differently, the basis of the refund is the reduction of the value of DALIGHT's properties in service from P282,024,877.40 to P122,175,433.40.  When the said value increased to P420,606,811.82, the reason for the refund ceased.<br><br>That time came to pass on December 14, 1984, not on September 18, 1989.<br><br>Be that as it may, the Board realizes the necessity of explaining the statement —<br><br>"This Decision shall take effect on the date hereof."<br><br>To be candid, that sentence is not only an unnecessary surplusage, but is to a large extent, meaningless.  Generally, the statement is used in connection with the approval of rate adjustments, which necessarily have beginning effectivity dates.  On the other hand, the approval of an appraisal, by itself, does not have any effect at all on the rates of a public utility.  It is only when an adjustment is made on a utility's rates, using the appraisal as basis, could it be correctly said that the appraisal has taken effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>As regards the second issue, the Court of Appeals held that —<br><blockquote>As to the second issue, it is necessary to refer to the pertinent portions of the following orders:<br><blockquote>1) "x x x  Accordingly, <span style="font-style: italic;">applicant is hereby directed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">furnish the Board with the documents</span> above stated<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> during the period form January 19, 1984 to September 18, 1989</span>,</span> x x x" (Order dated February 26, 1998).<br><br>2) "x x x The Commission on Audit (COA) is hereby requested to cause the audit and examination of the book and other records of DALIGHT as it deemed necessary, <span style="font-style: italic;">including the abovementioned documents, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for purposes of computing the refund</span> in this case <span style="text-decoration: underline;">covering the period from January 19, 1984 to December 14, 1984</span></span>, and thereafter submit to the Board its audit report, copies furnished the parties herein who are given fifteen (15) days from receipt hereof to submit their respective comments thereon, in order to aid the Board in determining the appropriate refund.  x x x" (Order dated June 4, 1998)<br></blockquote>We consider that while the period in the later order was declared by respondent Board for the purpose of computing petitioners' refund, there was no such express declaration in the earlier order.  The period in the first order refers to the inclusive dates of the documents to be furnished to public respondent by private.  However, the latter had the effect of providing a period of computing petitioners' refund.<br><br>Query?  Why else then would documents pertaining to the said period be submitted were it not for the purpose of computing petitioners' refund?  It would be inutile to issue such order if not for the accomplishment of the said purpose.<br><br>Clearly, one can perceive that the Order of June 4, 1998 modified and/or changed the February 26, 1998 Order.  While the earlier order provided the cut-off date as September 18, 1989, the later order specified the cut-off date of December 14, 1984.<br><br>The foregoing modification materially affected the rights of petitioners, as the reduction of the cut-off date shortened the period of the computation of petitioners' refund, which resulted in the diminution of the amount of said refund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>In arriving at the afore-quoted conclusion, the Court of Appeals proceeded from the presumption that the 26 February 1996 order of the ERB contained 18 September 1989 as the cut-off date.

If the office in which the record is kept is in a foreign country, the certificate may be made by a secretary of the embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent or by any officer in the foreign service of the Philippines stationed in the foreign country in which the record is kept, and authenticated by the seal of his office.<br><br>Sec. 25.  What attestation of copy must state. -  Whenever a copy of a document or record is attested for the purpose of evidence, the attestation must state, in substance that the copy is a correct copy of the original, or a specific part thereof, as the case may be.  The attestation must be under the official seal of the attesting officer, if there be any, or if he be the clerk of a court having seal, under the seal of such court.<br></blockquote>In this case, we are inclined to give credence to the copy of the 26 February 1998 ERB order attached to the present petition as it was the certified copy issued by the ERB — the agency which promulgated it and is presumed to maintain the true and correct copy of said decision in its files.  Besides, even the ERB maintains that the Annex "N" in respondents' petition before the Court of Appeals is not a faithful copy of the original and that "[t]he February 26, 1998 Order actually issued by the Board and which forms part of the records of ERB Case No. 91-181 specifies the period January 19, 1984 to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">December 14, 1984</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>As aptly observed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 55735<br><blockquote>Moreover, even if it was indeed true that the ERB Order received by petitioners stated that the period was "from January 19, 1984 to September 18, 1989," that does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span> mean that the private respondents altered or falsified the said order when it is clear that the order on file before the ERB states that the cut-off period was "from January 14, 1984 to December 14, 1984."  The signed original copy of the questioned order, which is on file with the ERB, shall be considered as the best evidence anent the contents of said order.  It is significant to point out that other than [sic] petitioners' imputation of the alleged alteration of  dates, no other evidence was shown to substantiate the allegation that private respondents were the ones who initiated or took part in the said falsification and/or alteration.  We also note that other than petitioners' bare allegations, no evidence was presented to show that private respondents gave unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to any party causing undue damage to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> premises considered, this Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.

No. 69592, we stated that "[u]nder Presidential Decree No. 40 it is expressly provided that the setting up of transmission lines grids and the construction of associated generation facilities shall be the responsibility of the National Power Corporation as the authorized implementing agency of the State.  In the same manner plant additions necessary to meet the increase in power demand in the area covered thereby shall be constructed and owned by the NPC.<br><br>Accordingly, there is no dispute that DALIGHT (petitioner herein) is no longer allowed to replace its generators.  In fact, the obligation to pay for four (4) generators was assumed by NPC and they were just leased to DALIGHT.<br><br>On the other hand, the claim of DALIGHT that it was advised by NPC to retain its generators as standby units, appears to be a mere temporary measure when there was only one line connecting the Agus Grid in Iligan City to Davao City passing through dangerous rebel infested territories, then in constant danger of sabotage.  Presently, however, there are more lines passing safe areas which precluded the danger of Davao City from being cut off from the Agno Grid thru sabotage.  x x x.<br><br>As DALIGHT is precluded by PD No. 40 from replacing these assets said generators with an approved sound value of P153,504,500.00 should have been excluded from the appraisal."
