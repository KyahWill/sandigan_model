Abellera of the Budget and Finance Bureau, by letter dated June 7, 1994, informed Resident Auditor Dorado that it had not received any request for such authorization from the National Museum and that, in any event, the grant of such benefits would not be given due course for lack of legal basis, citing Section 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of Administrative Order (A.O.)

Herrera, President of the National Museum Rank-and-File Employees Association (NMRFEA), in her personal capacity and as authorized representative of the rank-and-file employees, filed the instant petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which prays for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and Writ of Preliminary Injunction.<br><br>This Court, on October 2, 2001, issued a Temporary Restraining Order directing the COA to cease and desist from enforcing its Decision dated June 22, 1999, effective immediately and until further orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), which had filed consecutive motions for extension to file comment on the petition, eventually filed a Motion to Admit Attached Manifestation and Motion in Lieu of Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  In its Manifestation and Motion, the OSG stated that it was unable to sustain the questioned Decision of the COA and thus prayed that the same, as well as the Resolution dated August 3, 2001 and the Notice of Disallowance No. 94-02-101 P(93) dated July 19, 1994, be set aside.<br><br>On request of the OSG, this Court gave COA the chance to file its own comment.<br><br>COA did file its Comment on June 13, 2002, to which petitioners filed a reply.<br><br>The petition faults the COA:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>. . .

Alcala</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> is on all fours with the instant case, hence, decisive of the present controversy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> a review of the factual circumstances attendant to that case is in order.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera</span>, officials and employees of several government departments and agencies were paid incentive benefits for the year 1992.  On January 19, 1993, however, A.O. 29 was issued by President Ramos reiterating the prohibition under Section 7 of A.O. No. 268 against granting productivity incentive benefits or similar forms of allowances/benefits without prior approval of the President.  The same issuance authorized productivity incentive benefits for 1992 only in the maximum amount of P1,000 for each employee.<br><br>In compliance with Section 4 of the same A.O. 29 which directed all departments, offices, and agencies that overpaid incentive benefits to immediately cause the return or refund of the excess amount within a six-month period, deductions began to be made from the salaries and allowances of the petitioner-employees in <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera.</span>  The petitioners sought relief from this Court, praying that A.O. 29 and A.O. 268 be declared void.<br><br>The Court upheld both administrative orders as having been issued in the valid exercise of presidential control over the executive departments.  Nonetheless, it held that the therein petitioners could not be required to refund the incentive benefits, there being no indicia of bad faith on the part of all parties involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioners assert that they, too, like those in <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera</span>, may not be compelled to return or refund the subject incentive benefits since they were released and received by them in good faith.<br><br>Particularly with regard to petitioner Casal and the other officers held liable for their participation in approving/authorizing the award ("approving officers"), petitioners claim that their failure to observe the relevant administrative orders were mere lapses which are consistent with the presumption of good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that while the <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera</span> ruling maybe invoked by the employees who received the subject award in good faith, the same provides no refuge for the herein petitioners-approving officers due to significant factual distinctions between<span style="font-style: italic;"> Blaquera</span> and the instant case.<br><br>First, while the incentive benefits in <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera</span> were for CY <span style="font-weight: bold;">1992</span> and paid prior to the issuance of A.O. 29 on January 19, 1993, the incentive awards subject of the instant petition were released in December of <span style="font-weight: bold;">1993</span>.  When, therefore, the heads of departments and agencies in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Blaquera </span>erroneously authorized the incentive benefits to the employee, they did not then have the benefit of the categorical pronouncement of the President in A.O. 29 that<br><blockquote>[t]he prohibition prescribed under Section 7 of Administrative Order No. 268 is [thereby] reiterated.  Accordingly, all heads of government offices/agencies, including government-owned and/or controlled corporations, as well as their respective governing boards are hereby enjoined and prohibited from authorizing/granting Productivity Incentive Benefits or any and all similar forms of allowances/benefits without prior approval and authorization via Administrative Order by the Office of the President.<br></blockquote>The same, however, is not the case with respect to the herein petitioners-approving officers since the subject award was released when A.O. 29 had already been in effect for nearly a year.  Moreover, unlike in <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera,</span> the prohibition stated in Section 7 of A.O. 268 was brought to the attention of these approving officers by the CSC even prior to the issuance of A.O. 29.<br><br>Thus, in a letter dated December 21, 1992 addressed to petitioner Casal, then CSC Chairman Patricia A. Sto. Tomas, replying to Casal's request for approval of the Museum's ESIAS,  stated:<br><blockquote>This Commission, after a careful evaluation of the said ESIAS, hereby approves the same, <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">provided</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">productivity</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incentive</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">award</span> under Section 9(e) (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) thereof <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">made</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subject</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">result</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">comprehensive</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">study</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">undertaken</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Office</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">coordination</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Civil</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Commission</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Department</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Budget</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Management</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">matter</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">as embodied under Section 7 of the Administrative Order No. 268</span> dated February 21, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The immediately quoted proviso, it bears emphasis, was annotated on the National Museum's ESIAS itself, just below the name and signature of Chairman Sto. Tomas signifying the CSC's approval of said document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>When petitioner Casal and the approving officers authorized the subject award then, they disregarded a prohibition that was not only declared by the President through A.O. 268, but also brought to their attention by the CSC by a letter specifically addressed to petitioner Casal and by annotation on the Museum's ESIAS.  Above all, at the time the same officers approved the award, the prohibition in A.O. 268 had already been reiterated by the President via A.O. 29.<br><br>The failure of petitioners-approving officers to observe all these issuances cannot be deemed a mere lapse consistent with the presumption of good faith.  Rather, even if the grant of the incentive award were not for a dishonest purpose as they claimed, the patent disregard of the issuances of the President and the directives of the COA amounts to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gross</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negligence</span>, making them liable for the refund thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  The following ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">National Electrification Administration v. COA</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> bears repeating:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Executive officials who are subordinate to the President should not trifle with the President's constitutional power of control over the executive branch.  There is only one Chief Executive who directs and controls the entire executive branch, and all other executive officials must implement in good faith his directives and orders.</span>  This is necessary to provide order, efficiency and coherence in carrying out the plans, policies and programs of the executive branch.<br><br>This case would not have arisen had NEA complied in good faith with the directives and orders of the President in implementation of the last phase of the Salary Standardization Law II.  The directives and orders are clearly and manifestly in accordance with all relevant laws.  The reasons advanced by NEA in disregarding the President's directives and orders are patently flimsy, even ill-conceived.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">This cannot be countenanced as it will result in chaos and disorder in the executive branch to the detriment of public service.</span>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As to the employees who received the incentive award without participating in the approval thereof, it cannot be said that they were either in bad faith or grossly negligent in so doing.  The imprimatur given by the approving officers on such award certainly tended to give it a color of legality from the perspective of these employees.   Being in good faith, they cannot, following <span style="font-style: italic;">Blaquera,</span> be compelled to refund the benefits already granted to them.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">PARTIALLY GRANTED</span>. The Decision dated June 22, 1999 of respondent COA and its Resolution dated August 3, 2001 are declared INVALID only insofar as they hold liable all National Museum employees who merely received the incentive award for CY 1993.<br><br>Accordingly, the Temporary Restraining Order directed to COA which was issued by this Court on October 2, 2001 is hereby made PERMANENT as to the employees who were held liable to reimburse, merely for receiving the incentive award.
