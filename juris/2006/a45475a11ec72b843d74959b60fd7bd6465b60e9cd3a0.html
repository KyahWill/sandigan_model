EXCLUSIVE BARGAINING REPRESENTATION AND WORKERS' PARTICIPATION IN POLICY AND DECISION-MAKING<br><br>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">labor organization <span style="text-decoration: underline;">designated or selected by the majority</span> of the employees in an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appropriate</span> collective bargaining unit</span> shall be the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive</span> representative</span> of the employees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining. However, an individual employee or group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer.<br><br>Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, workers shall have the right, subject to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Labor and Employment may promulgate, to participate in policy and decision-making process of the establishment where they are employed insofar as said processes will directly affect their rights, benefits and welfare. For this purpose, workers and employers may form labor-management councils: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> That the representatives of the workers in such labor management councils shall be elected by at least the majority of all employees in said establishment. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As the immediately quoted provision declares, only the labor organization designated or selected by the majority of the employees in an appropriate collective bargaining unit is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive representative</span> of the employees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining.<br><br>The union (hereafter referred to as respondent) is admittedly not the exclusive representative of the majority of the employees of petitioner, hence, it could not demand from petitioner the right to bargain collectively in their behalf.<br><br>Respondent insists, however, that it could validly bargain in behalf of "its members," relying on Article 242 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> &nbsp;Respondent's reliance on said article, a general provision on the rights of legitimate labor organizations, is misplaced, for not every legitimate labor organization possesses the rights mentioned therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Article 242 (a) must be read in relation to above-quoted Article 255.<br><br>On respondent's contention that it was bargaining in behalf only of its members, the appellate court, affirming the NLRC's observation that the same would only "fragment the employees" of petitioner,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> held that "what [respondent] will be achieving is to divide the employees, more particularly, the rank-and-file employees of [petitioner] . . . the other workers who are <span style="font-style: italic;">not members</span> are at a serious disadvantage, because if the same shall be allowed, employees who are non-union members will be economically impaired and will not be able to negotiate their terms and conditions of work, thus defeating the very essence and reason of collective bargaining, which is an effective safeguard against the evil schemes of employers in terms and conditions of work."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; This Court finds the observation well-taken.<br><br>It bears noting that the goal of the DOLE is geered towards "a single employer wide unit which is more to the broader and greater benefit of the employees working force."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> &nbsp;The philosophy is to avoid fragmentation of the bargaining unit so as to strengthen the employees' bargaining power with the management. &nbsp;To veer away from such goal would be contrary, inimical and repugnant to the objectives of a strong and dynamic unionism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's refusal to bargain then with respondent can not be considered a ULP to justify the staging of the strike.<br><br>The second ground alleged by respondent to justify the staging of the strike ‚Äì that petitioner prevented or intimidated some workers from joining the union before, during or after the strike ‚Äì was correctly discredited by the appellate court in this wise:<br><blockquote>. . . &nbsp;a careful study of the allegations of petitioners in their petition reveals that it contained <span style="text-decoration: underline;">general allegations</span> that the Management of the Hotel committed unfair labor practices by refusing to bargain with the union and by alleged acts of union interference, coercion and discrimination tantamount to union-busting. Since it is the union who alleges that unfair labor practices were committed by the Hotel,  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the burden of proof is on theunion to prove its allegations by substantial evidence</span>.<br><br>Moreover, while petitioner Union continues to accuse the private respondent Hotel of violating their constitutional right to organize by busting the Union, this Court cannot overlook the events that transpired prior to the strike that the Union staged on November 29, 1997. It is beyond argument that a conciliatory meeting was still scheduled to be held on December 1, 1997 before the NCMB. In this conciliatory meeting, petitioner Union could have substantiated and presented additional evidences. Thus, as held by the Supreme Court in the case of Tiu vs. National Labor Relations Commission:<br><blockquote>"The Court is not unmindful of this rule, but in the case at bar <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the facts and the evidence did not establish events [</span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">sic</span>   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">] leasta rational basis why the union would [wield] a strike basedon alleged unfair labor practices it did not even bother tosubstantiate</span> during the conciliation proceedings. It is not enough that the union believed that the employer committed acts of unfair labor practice when the circumstances clearly negate even a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie </span>[showing to] warrant [such a] belief."<br></blockquote> It is also evident from the records of the instant petition, specifically from the Notice of Strike, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">their principal ground for the strike was the "refusal of the Hotel Management to bargain collectively with the Unionfor the benefit of the latter's members</span>." In the instant case, it is not disputed that the  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">petitioner UNION is not a certified bargaining unit to negotiate acollective bargaining agreement (CBA) with private respondent Hotel</span> . . .&nbsp; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On top of the foregoing observations, this Court notes that respondent violated Article 264 which proscribes the staging of a strike on the ground of ULP during the pendency of cases involving the same grounds for the strike.<br><br>Further, the photographs taken during the strike, as well as the Ocular Inspection Report of the NLRC representative, show that the strikers, with the use of ropes and footed placards, blockaded the driveway to the Hotel's points of entrance and exit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> making it burdensome for guests and prospective guests to enter the Hotel, thus violating Article 264 (e) of the Labor Code which provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 264 (e) No person engaged in picketing shall commit any act of violence, coercion or intimidation or <span style="font-weight: bold;">obstruct the free ingress to or egress from the employer's premises</span> for lawful purposes, or obstruct public thoroughfares. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Furthermore, the photographs indicate that indeed the strikers held noise barrage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and threatened guests with bodily harm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Finally, the police reports mention about the strikers' exploding of firecrackers, causing the guests to panic and transfer to other areas of the Hotel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>It is doctrinal that the exercise of the right of private sector employees to strike is not absolute. &nbsp;Thus Section 3 of Article XIII of the Constitution, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations and peaceful concerted activities, including the <span style="font-weight: bold;">right to strike in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accordance with law</span></span>. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Even if the purpose of a strike is valid, the strike may still be held illegal where the means employed are illegal. &nbsp;Thus, the employment of violence, intimidation, restraint or coercion in carrying out concerted activities which are injurious to the rights to property renders a strike illegal. &nbsp;And so is picketing or the obstruction to the free use of property or the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, when accompanied by intimidation, threats, violence, and coercion as to constitute nuisance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>As the appellate court correctly held, the union <span style="font-weight: bold;">officers</span> should be dismissed for staging and participating in the illegal strike, following paragraph 3, Article 264(a) of the Labor Code which provides that ". . .[a]ny <span style="font-weight: bold;">union officer</span> who  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knowingly participates in anillegal strike</span> and any <span style="font-weight: bold;">worker or union officer</span> who  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">knowingly participates in thecommission of illegal acts during strike</span> may be declared to have lost his employment status . . ."<br><br>An ordinary striking <span style="font-weight: bold;">worker</span> cannot, thus be dismissed for mere participation in an illegal strike. There must be proof that he committed illegal acts during a strike, unlike a union officer who may be dismissed by mere knowingly participating in an illegal strike and/or committing an illegal act during a strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The appellate court found no convincing and substantial proof, however, that the strikers-members of respondent who participated in the illegal strike committed illegal acts.<br><blockquote>In the present case, private respondent Hotel failed to established [<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>] by convincing and substantial evidence that these union members who participated in the illegal strike committed illegal acts. Consequently, they cannot be terminated from service for their participation in an illegal strike. Moreover, private respondent Hotel presented as evidence photographs of the striking employees, the question that comes to our mind is: why were these strikers who allegedly participated in illegal acts not identified or named? Instead the arbitral tribunal found it worthy of credence to summarily dismiss all the union members without them being named or identified . . . <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court finds otherwise.&nbsp; As reflected above, the photographs show that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> of the workers-strikers who joined the strike indeed committed illegal acts ‚Äì blocking the free ingress to and egress from the Hotel, holding noise barrage, threatening guests, and the like. &nbsp;The strikers were, in a list<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> attached to petitioner's Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> filed with the NLRC, named.<br><br>The list failed to specifically identify the ones who actually committed illegal acts, however.&nbsp; Such being the case, a remand of the case to the Labor Arbiter, through the NLRC, is in order  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the purpose only of determining the respective liabilities of thestrikers listed by petitioner</span>. &nbsp;Those proven to have committed illegal acts during the course of the strike are deemed to have lost their employment, unless they have been readmitted by the Hotel, whereas those not clearly shown to have committed illegal acts should be reinstated.<br><br>Whether those ordered reinstated are entitled to backwages is, however, another matter.<br><br>For the general rule is that backwages shall not be awarded in an economic strike on the principle that "a fair day's wage" accrues only for a "fair day's labor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> &nbsp;Even in cases of ULP strikes, award of backwages rests on the court's discretion and only in exceptional instances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">J.P. Heilbronn Co. v.
