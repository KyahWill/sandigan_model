Lot No. 196, T.C.T. No. 17100), as well as the resolution denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.<br><br>On August 7, 1998, Pastora R. Lozano filed a petition with the RTC of Villasis, Pangasinan, for the reconstitution of the original copy of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 17100 covering Lot No. 196 of the Cadastral Survey of Villasis, Pangasinan. She prayed that, after due notice, publication, and hearing, an order be issued directing the Register of Deeds of Lingayen, Pangasinan to reconstitute the office file of the title to be based on the technical description embodied in the owner's duplicate copy itself, upon payment of the required legal fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On August 12, 1998, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> setting the initial hearing of the petition at 8:30 a.m. on December 2, 1998. During the hearing, petitioner did not appear. Neither was there any opposition to the petition, although the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor entered his special appearance for the Republic of the Philippines. The hearing was reset at 8:30 a.m. on January 27, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  However, on January 11, 1999, the trial court learned that its August 12, 1998 Order had not been published in a newspaper of general circulation in Pangasinan, or in the Official Gazette, as mandated by law. The hearing set on January 27, 1999 was cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Also, on January 11, 1999, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> stating that the petition, being sufficient in form and substance, set for initial hearing at 8:30 a.m. on July 8, 1999, and all interested persons were enjoined to appear and show cause why the same should not be granted.<br><br>On March 27, 1999, petitioner died intestate and was survived by her heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thereafter, the heirs prayed that they be substituted as petitioners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  attaching thereto a Special Power of Attorney appointing German R.

Despite the foregoing, the trial court issued on July 8, 1999 an Order of General Default, declaring that petitioners were able to establish the jurisdictional requirements for the court to take cognizance of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>During the hearing on October 19, 1999, German R.

Upon the demise of the spouses Racadio, they were survived by their daughter, Pastora Lozano, as sole heir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  Sometime in 1957, Pastora Lozano left Pangasinan and was employed in Manila. She entrusted the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to German R. Lozano who, since then had been in possession of said certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> They were not aware how the spouses Marciano Racadio and Emiliana Galima acquired the property, but Pastora Lozano used to tell German Lozano that it was acquired from Sixto Dominguez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The property was declared for taxation purposes in 1998 under the name of Marciano Racadio as owner, under Tax Declaration No. 004-00250,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and that the realty taxes on the property were paid for 1998-1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Petitioners had a technical description of the property issued by a surveyor of the Local Management Office on July 9, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, German Lozano admitted that the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100 does not contain the signature of the Register of Deeds, and that the number of the title is handwritten.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  Petitioners formally offered their documentary evidence which the court admitted "for whatever they might be worth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On January 26, 2000, the RTC rendered judgment granting the petition.  The <span style="font-style: italic;">fallo </span>of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the court, finding the documentary and parole evidence adduced to be adequate and sufficiently persuasive to warrant the reconstitution  of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17100, and pursuant to Section 110, PD 1529 and Sections 2(a) and 15 of R.A. 26, hereby directs the Register of Deeds of Lingayen, Pangasinan to reconstitute the office file copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17100 covering the subject lot in the name of the registered owner-spouses Marciano Racadio and Emiliana Galima as appearing in the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 17100, without prejudice to the annotation of subsisting rights or interests not duly noted in these proceedings, if any, and the right of the Administrator, Land Registration Authority, as provided for in Section 16, Land Registration Commission (now NALDTRA) Circular No. 35 dated June 13, 1983.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>The Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), as appellant, appealed the decision to the CA.<br><br>In its Appellant's Brief, the OSG assigned the lone error that the trial court erred in ordering the Register of Deeds of Lingayen, Pangasinan to reconstitute the office file copy of TCT No. 17100 on the basis of an unauthenticated owner's duplicate copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>It averred that petitioners failed to adduce in evidence the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100 which bears the signature of the Register of Deeds.  Since petitioners failed to establish the genuineness and due execution of the owner's duplicate copy of the title certificate, the trial court erred in granting the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>For their part, the heirs of Pastora Lozano alleged that since the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> is the duplicate original of TCT No. 17100 within the context of Rule 130, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Evidence, proof of the execution and genuineness of the owner's duplicate copy is no longer necessary. Besides, the owner's duplicate of said title is in the nature of a public document, hence, admissible in evidence without further proof of due execution or genuineness.  Moreover, no private parties opposed the petition. It behooved the oppositor to prove that the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> presented was not a duplicate copy thereof.<br><br>On August 27, 2004, the CA rendered judgment granting the appeal, holding as follows:<br><blockquote>After a thorough consideration of both parties' contentions, [w]e are convinced that the instant appeal is impressed with merit.<br><br>We give utmost consideration to the fact that the owner's duplicate copy presented by appellee was not duly signed by the Register of Deeds. This defect was neither clarified nor justified by appellee both before the lower court and before Us on appeal. Appellee merely explained that what was presented before the court was a duplicate original, and thus, need not be authenticated. Such explanation, however, does not change the fact that the owner's duplicate does not contain the Register of Deeds' signature, making the title inherently flawed.<br><br>Under Section 41, Act No. 496, it is provided that:<br><blockquote>"Immediately upon the entry of the decree of registration the clerk shall send a certified copy thereof, under the seal of the court to the register of deeds for the province, or provinces or city in which the land lies, and the register of deeds shall transcribe the decree in a book to be called the "Registration Book," in which a leaf, or leaves, in consecutive order, shall be devoted exclusively to each title. <span style="font-style: italic;">The entry made by the register of deeds in this book in each case shall be the original certificate of title, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and shall be signed by him</span> and sealed with the seal of the court. All certificates of title shall be numbered consecutively, beginning with number one. The register of deeds in each case make an exact duplicate of the original certificate, including the seal, but putting on it the words "owner's duplicate certificate," and deliver the same to the owner or to his attorney duly authorized.</span> In case of a variance between the owner's duplicate certificate and the original certificate, the original shall prevail. The certified copy of the decree of registration shall be filed and numbered by the register of deeds with a reference noted on it to the place of record of the original certificate of title: Provided, however, That when an application includes land lying in more than one province or one province and the city of Manila, the court shall cause the part lying in each province or in the city of Manila to be described separately by metes and bounds in the decree of registration, and the clerk shall send to the register of deeds of each province, or the city of Manila, as the case may be, a copy of the decree containing a description of the land within that province or city, and the register of deeds shall register the same and issue an owner's duplicate therefor, and thereafter for all matters pertaining to registration under this Act the portion in each province or city shall be treated as a separate parcel of land." (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Without the signature of the Register of  Deeds, the owner's duplicate copy presented by appellee as basis for the reconstitution could definitely be categorized as spurious and of dubious  origin. It would be very difficult to support and uphold the validity of a public document which does not bear the signature of the official in charge of the office which issued such document.  In all candidness, the trial court should have been more circumspect in appraising the value of the document presented before it. Although no person came forward to contest the reconstitution of the subject title even after the requirements of posting and publication have been complied with, the duplicate copy presented by appellee, on its face, is apparently flawed. In addition, the manner the title number was written should have also alarmed the trial court as it was obviously different from the other entries in the title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which the appellate court resolved to deny on September 28, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Thus, the instant petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, where petitioners assail the appellate court's ruling and contend that the RTC did not err when it ordered the Register of Deeds of Lingayen, Pangasinan, to reconstitute the office file copy of TCT No. 17100 on the basis of the unauthenticated duplicate copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Petitioners assert that, even if the duplicate original submitted by them is unsigned, this should not militate against their petition as they are not at fault. The lack of signature of the Register of Deeds is merely an irregularity that does not render the owner's duplicate void.  Besides, the issue of the validity of a Torrens title may be raised only in an action specifically brought to impugn or annul said title.<br><br>In its Comment on the petition, the OSG made the following averments:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>It is respectfully submitted that the issue submitted for resolution by petitioner as ground for the review of the assailed Court of Appeals' Decision is totally irrelevant and immaterial to the sole and primordial issue in cases of reconstitution of the original copy of certificates of title on file with the Registry of Deeds, i.e., whether or not petitioner presented a competent source for the reconstitution of the certificate of title.<br><br></li><li>It is respectfully submitted that the Court of Appeals did not err when it declared that petitioner's owner's duplicate copy is not a competent source for the reconstitution of the original copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17100, the same being not duly signed by the issuing Register of Deeds and its number being handwritten. Petitioner failed to explain such defect/irregularity.<br><br>While public documents, e.g., owner's duplicate copy of certificate of title, are admissible in evidence without further proof of their due execution or genuineness <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Antillon vs. Barcelon, 37 Phil. 148 [1917]),</span> the rule does not apply where, on its face, such documents are not authenticated by the official signature and seal which they are supposed to bear. Thus, while petitioner may argue that the subject property is covered by a certificate of title which was lost/destroyed, she is also duty-bound to present a competent source for its reconstitution. This, petitioner failed to do. Thus, no error may be attributed to the Court of Appeals when it reversed and set aside the RTC Decision dated January 26, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The sole issue is whether or not the owner's duplicate which does not bear the signature of the Register of Deeds is a competent source on which a reconstitution of a title certificate may be based.<br><br>The petition is denied for lack of merit.<br><br>Petitioners seek the reconstitution of the original copy of TCT No. 17100 in the custody of the Register of Deeds of Lingayen, Pangasinan. Section 10 of Republic Act (Rep. Act) No. 26 provides that the court before which a petition for the reconstitution of a TCT is filed shall cause a notice of the petition to be posted on the main entrance of the Provincial Capitol Building and of the municipal building of the municipality where the property is located, at least 30 days prior to the date of hearing, as provided in Section 9, which reads:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sec. 9.</span> A registered owner desiring to have his reconstituted certificate of title freed from the encumbrance mentioned in section seven of this Act, may file a petition to that end with the proper Court of First Instance, giving his reason or reasons therefor. A similar petition may, likewise, be filed by a mortgagee, lessee or other lien holder whose interest is annotated in the reconstituted certificate of title. Thereupon, the court shall cause <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">a notice of the petition to be published, at the expense of the petitioner, twice in successive issues of the Official Gazette, and to be posted on the main entrance of the provincial building and of the municipal building of the municipality or city in which the land lies,</span> at least thirty days prior to the date of hearing, and after hearing, shall determine the petition and render such judgment as justice and equity may require. The notice shall specify, among other things, the number of the certificate of title, the name of the registered owner, the names of the interested parties appearing in the reconstituted certificate of title, the location of the property, and the date on which all persons having an interest in the property must appear and file such claim as they may have. The petitioner shall, at the hearing, submit proof of the publication and posting of the notice. (Emphasis supplied)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sec. 10.</span> Nothing hereinbefore provided shall prevent any registered owner or person in interest from filing the petition mentioned in Section five of this Act directly with the proper Court of First Instance, based on sources enumerated in Sections 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b) and/or 4(a) of this Act: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, however</span>, That the Court shall cause a notice of the petition, before hearing and granting the same, to be published in the manner stated in Section nine hereof: <span style="font-style: italic;">And, provided, further</span>, That certificates of title reconstituted pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the encumbrance referred to in Section seven of this Act.<br></blockquote>In a catena of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court has ruled that the requirements under Rep. Act No. 26 are indispensable and must be strictly complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In this case, petitioners failed to cause the posting of the trial court's Order dated January 11, 1999 at the main entrance of the Provincial Capitol of Lingayen and at the Municipal Hall of Villasis; consequently, the trial court did not acquire any jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Director of Lands v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court ruled that the requirements of Rep. Act No. 26 must be interpreted strictly and must be applied vigorously with exactness and precision to safeguard against spurious, unfounded land ownership claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>It appears that the petitioners offered in evidence, as Exhibit "B," the Return of Sheriff Rodolfo Alcantara, Jr. for the purpose of proving, as the certification states, that he caused the posting of the petition, as well as the Order of the court dated January 11, 1999, in four (4) conspicuous places.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  The Sheriff's Return adverted to by petitioners appears on page 9 of the RTC records and reads:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">SHERIFF'S RETURN<br></div><br>In compliance with the Order of this Court dated August 12, 1998, issued by the Honorable Court in the above-entitled case, the undersigned has caused the posting of the copies of Order and Petition and its Annexes in the following places:<br><ol><li>Bulletin Board, RTC-Br. 50, Villasis, Pangasinan.</li><li>Provincial Capitol, Lingayen, Pangasinan.</li><li>The Registry of Deeds, Lingayen, Pangasinan.</li><li>Municipal Hall, Villasis, Pangasinan.</li></ol>Villasis, Pangasinan, this 20th day of August, 1998.<br><br>                                                                            Signature<br>                                                                            RODOLFO A.

However, the initial hearing on said date was cancelled and reset to July 8, 1999 at 8:30 a.m., per order of the court on January 11, 1999.  In fine, the Sheriff failed to post the trial court's January 11, 1999 Order.<br><br>Under Section 3 of Rep.

Inexplicably, they even also failed to prove the due execution of the original copy of TCT No. 17100, and failed to present any person before whom its execution was authorized, and who was present when it was executed; or the person who, after its execution saw it and recognized the signature of the Register of Deeds; or by a person to whom the Register of Deeds authorized to oversee such execution.<br><br>The reconstitution of the title or deed is simply the re-issuance of the copy of the certificate of title allegedly lost or destroyed in its original form and condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  The purpose of the reconstitution of title or any document is to have the same reproduced, after observing the procedure provided by law, in the same form they were when the loss or destruction occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Section 41, second paragraph of Act No. 496 reads:<br><blockquote>"Immediately upon the entry of the decree of registration the clerk shall send a certified copy thereof, under the seal of the court to the register of deeds for the province, or provinces or city in which the land lies, and the register of deeds shall transcribe the decree in a book to be called the "Registration Book," in which a leaf, or leaves, in consecutive order, shall be devoted exclusively toe ach title. <span style="font-style: italic;">The entry made by the register of deeds in this book in each case shall be the original certificate of title, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and shall be signed by him</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sealed with the seal of the court.

(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Any title issued by the Register of Deeds, including the original copy on file in the Office of the Register of Deeds or the owner's duplicate of said<br><br>title, must bear the signature of the Register of Deeds.  Hence, the owner's duplicate copy of title relied upon by the petitioner must be authentic and not spurious. In this case, the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100 which petitioners adduced in evidence is not signed by the Register of Deeds, and does not even contain the number of the title certificate. After the words <span style="font-style: italic;">"Certifico de Transferencio De Titulo No."</span> is a blank space where the number of the title is supposed to be typewritten. The petitioners failed to explain why the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100 does not contain such signature. Thus, the ruling of the CA that the owner's duplicate presented by the petitioners is spurious is correct.<br><br>It appears that TCT No. 17100 was issued on October 3, 1940 in the names of the spouses Racadio.  However, the property was not declared for taxation purposes since then.  It was only in 1998, long after the demise of the spouses, that the property was declared for taxation purposes under their names and the realty taxes due thereon were paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <br><br>German Lozano surmised that his grandparents, the spouses Racadio, acquired the property from Sixto Dominguez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> From the face of the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 17100, it was issued in 1940.  Assuming that the claim of petitioners that  the spouses Racadio had acquired the property from Sixto Dominguez as early as 1940, they nevertheless still failed to explain why the technical description of the property prepared by the Land Management Office under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on July 9, 1998, is still in the name of Sixto Dominguez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  When asked if he scrutinized the technical description of the property before submitting it to the court, German Lozano admitted that he failed to do so.<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Do you know a person b y the name of Sixto Dominguez? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">My mother was saying before that she bought that from Sixto Dominguez. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">In fact, this Sixto Dominguez was the one who caused the survey of this lot as indicated here in the certification? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I don't know if he was the one who caused the survey, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And who secured this Exh.

Indeed, there is no evidence on record that the spouses Racadio acquired the property from Sixto Dominguez.<br><br>Obviously, the trial court failed to scrutinize and verify carefully the owner's duplicate offered by petitioners and the accompanying documents of the petition for reconstitution.  Once again, the Court reiterates its warning in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tahanan Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote>Time and again, the integrity and inviolability of Torrens titles issued pursuant to the Land Registration Act (Act 496) and Presidential Decree No. 1529 have been shaken by the very courts whose unwavering duty should be to protect the rights and interests of title holders but instead have favored claimants under the guise of reconstitution filed after a long lapse of time after the Japanese occupation, alleging the existence of original and duplicate certificates of title issued pursuant to a  court decree but have subsequently been lost or destroyed  including the records of the land registration case on account of the war and lay claim and title to valuable parcels of land previously titled and registered under the Torrens registration system and are even able to dispose these properties to unsuspecting homelot buyers and speculating land developers. The courts must be cautious and careful in granting reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificates of title, both original and duplicate owner's, based on  documents and decrees made to appear authentic from mere xerox copies and certifications of officials supposedly signed with the seals of their office affixed thereon, considering the ease and facility with which documents are made to appear as official and authentic. It is the duty of the court to scrutinize and verify carefully all supporting documents, deeds and certifications. Each and every fact, circumstance or incident which corroborates or relates to the existence and loss of the title should be examined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED </span>for lack of merit.
