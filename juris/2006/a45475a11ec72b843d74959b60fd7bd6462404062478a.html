However, on 14 October 1981, respondent returned all the checks to petitioner without clearing them on the ground that they were materially altered.  Thus, petitioner instituted an action for collection of sums of money against respondent to recover the value of the checks.<br><br><u><b><center>The Ruling of the Trial Court</center></b></u><br>The trial court ruled that respondent is expected to use reasonable business practices in accepting and paying the checks presented to it.  Thus, respondent cannot be faulted for the delay in clearing the checks considering the ingenuity in which the alterations were effected. The trial court observed that there was no attempt from petitioner to verify the status of the checks before petitioner paid the value of the checks or allowed withdrawal of the  deposits. According to the trial court, petitioner, as collecting bank,  could have inquired by telephone from respondent, as drawee bank, about the status of the checks before paying their value. Since the immediate cause of petitioner's loss was the lack of caution of its personnel, the trial court held that petitioner is not entitled to recover the value of the checks from respondent.<br><blockquote>The dispositive portion of the trial court's Decision reads:<br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing both the complaint and the counterclaim. Costs shall, however be assessed against the plaintiff.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner appealed the trial court's Decision before the Court of Appeals.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b></center><br>In its 10 October 1991 Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court of Appeals reversed  the trial court's Decision.  Applying Section 4(c) of Central Bank Circular No. 580, series of 1977,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Court of Appeals held that checks that have been materially altered shall be returned within 24 hours after discovery of the alteration.  However, the Court of Appeals ruled that even if the drawee bank returns a check with material alterations after discovery of the alteration, the return would not relieve the drawee bank from any liability for its failure to return the checks within the 24-hour clearing period.  The Court of Appeals explained:<br><blockquote>Does this mean that, as long  as the drawee bank returns a check with material alteration within 24 hour[s] after discovery of such alteration, such return would have the effect of relieving the bank of any liability whatsoever despite its failure to return the check within the 24- hour clearing house rule?<br><br>We do not think so.<br><br>Obviously, such bank cannot be held  liable for its failure to return the check in question not later than the next regular clearing.  However, this Court  is of the opinion and so holds that it could still be held liable if it fails to exercise due diligence in verifying the alterations made.  In other words, such bank would still be expected, nay required, to make the proper verification before the 24-hour regular clearing period lapses, or in cases where such lapses may be deemed inevitable, that the required verification should be made within a reasonable time.<br><br>The implication of the rule  that a check shall be returned within the 24-hour clearing period is that if the collecting bank paid the check  before the end of the aforesaid 24- hour clearing period, it would be responsible  therefor such that if the said check is dishonored and returned within the 24-hour clearing period, the drawee bank cannot be held liable. Would such an implication apply in the case of materially altered checks returned within 24 hours after discovery?  This Court finds nothing in the letter of the above-cited C.B. Circular that would justify a negative answer.  Nonetheless, the drawee bank could still be held liable in certain instances.  Even if the return of the check/s in question is done within 24 hours after discovery, if it can be shown that the drawee bank had been patently negligent in the performance of its verification function, this Court finds no reason why the said bank should  be relieved of liability.<br><br>Although banking practice has it that the presumption of clearance is conclusive when it comes to the application of the 24-hour clearing period, the  same principle may not be applied to the 24-hour period vis-a-vis material alterations in the sense that the drawee bank which returns materially altered checks within 24 hours after discovery would be conclusively relieved of any liability thereon.  This is because there could well be various intervening events or factors that could affect the rights and obligations of the parties in cases such as the instant one including  patent negligence on the part of the drawee bank resulting in an unreasonable delay in detecting the alterations.  While it is true that the pertinent proviso in C.B. Circular No. 580 allows the drawee bank to return the altered check within the period "provided by law for  filing a legal action", this does not mean that this would entitle or allow the drawee bank to be grossly negligent and, inspite thereof, avail itself of the maximum period allowed by the above-cited Circular.  The discovery must be made within a reasonable time taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case.  In other words, the aforementioned C.B. Circular does not provide the drawee bank the license to be grossly negligent on the one hand nor does it preclude the collecting bank from raising available defenses even if the check is properly returned within the 24-hour period after discovery of the material alteration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </blockquote> The Court of Appeals rejected the trial court's opinion that petitioner could have verified the status of the checks by telephone call since such imposition is not required under Central Bank rules.  The dispositive portion of the 10 October 1991 Decision reads:<br><blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and the defendant- appellee Philippine National Bank is declared liable for the value of the fifteen checks specified and enumerated in the decision of the trial court (page 3) in the amount of P1,447,920.00<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Respondent filed a motion for reconsideration of the 10 October 1991 Decision.  In its 9 August 1994 Amended Decision, the Court of Appeals reversed itself and affirmed the Decision of the trial court dismissing the complaint.<br><br>In reversing itself, the Court of Appeals held that its 10 October 1991 Decision failed to appreciate that the rule on the return of altered checks within 24 hours from the discovery of the alteration had been duly passed by the Central Bank and accepted by the members of the banking system.  Until the rule is repealed or amended, the rule has to be applied.<br><br>Petitioner moved for the reconsideration of the Amended Decision.  In its 16 July 1997 Resolution, the Court of Appeals denied the motion for lack of merit.<br><br>Hence, the recourse to this Court.<br><br><b><center><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Issues</span> </center> </b><br>Petitioner raises the following issues in its Memorandum:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether the checks were materially altered;<br><br></li><li>Whether respondent was negligent in failing to recognize within a reasonable period the altered checks and in not returning the checks within the period; and<br><br></li><li>Whether the motion for reconsideration filed by    respondent was out of time thus making the 10 October 1991 Decision final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><b><center> <u>The Ruling of This Court<br><br> </u> </center> </b> <b><center> <i>Filing of the Petition under both Rules 45 and 65 </i> </center> </b><br>Respondent asserts that the petition should be dismissed outright since petitioner availed of a wrong mode of appeal.  Respondent cites <i>Ybañez v.

The petition before the Court is clearly meritorious. Further, the petition was filed on time both under Rules 45 and 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Hence, in accordance with the liberal spirit which pervades the Rules of Court and in the interest of justice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we will treat the petition as having been filed under Rule 45.<br><br><b><i><center> Alteration of Serial Number Not Material </center> </i></b><br>The alterations in the checks were made on their serial numbers.<br><br>Sections 124 and 125 of Act No. 2031, otherwise known as the Negotiable Instruments Law, provide:<br><blockquote>SEC. 124.  <i>Alteration of instrument; effect of</i>. - Where a negotiable instrument is materially altered without the assent of all parties liable thereon, it is avoided, except as against a party who has himself made, authorized, or assented to the alteration and subsequent indorsers.<br><br>But when an instrument has been materially altered and is in the hands of a holder in due course, not a party to the alteration, he may enforce payment thereof according to its original tenor.<br><br>SEC. 125.  <i>What constitutes a material alteration</i>. - Any alteration which changes:<br><br>(a) The date;<br>(b) The sum payable, either for principal or interest;<br>(c) The time or place of payment;<br>(d) The number or the relations of the parties;<br>(e) The medium or currency in which payment is to be made;<br><br>or which adds a place of payment where no place of payment is specified, or any other change or addition which alters the effect of the instrument in any respect, is a material alteration.</blockquote>The question on whether an alteration of the serial number of a check is a material alteration under the Negotiable Instruments Law is already a settled matter.  In <i>Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals</i>, this Court ruled that the alteration on the serial number of a check is not a material alteration.  Thus:<br><blockquote>An alteration is said to be material if it alters the effect of the instrument.  It means an unauthorized change in an instrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party.  In other words, a material alteration is one which changes the items which are required to be stated under Section 1 of the Negotiable Instrument[s] Law.<br><br>Section 1 of the Negotiable Instruments Law provides:<br><br>Section 1. Form of negotiable instruments.  An instrument to be negotiable must conform to the following requirements:<br><br>(a)  It must be in writing and signed by the maker or drawer;<br><br>(b)  Must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money;<br><br>(c)  Must be payable on demand, or at a fixed or determinable future time;<br><br>(d)  Must be payable to order or to bearer; and<br><br>(e)  Where the instrument is addressed to a drawee, he must be named or otherwise indicated therein with reasonable certainty.<br><br>In his book entitled "Pandect of Commercial Law and Jurisprudence," Justice Jose C. Vitug opines that "an innocent alteration (generally, changes on items other than those required to be stated under Sec. 1, N.I.L.) and spoliation (alterations done by a stranger) will not avoid the instrument, but the holder may enforce it only according to its original tenor.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The case at the bench is unique in the sense that what was altered is the serial number of the check in question, an item which, it can readily be observed, is not an essential requisite for negotiability under Section 1 of the Negotiable Instruments Law.  The aforementioned alteration did not change the relations between the parties.  The name of the drawer and the drawee were not altered.  The intended payee was the same.  The sum of money due to the payee remained the same. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The check's serial number is not the sole indication of its origin.  As succinctly found by the Court of Appeals, the name of the government agency which issued the subject check was prominently printed therein.  The check's issuer was therefore sufficiently identified, rendering the referral to the serial number redundant and inconsequential. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Petitioner, thus cannot refuse to accept the check in question on the ground that the serial number was altered, the same being an immaterial or innocent one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote> Likewise, in the present case the alterations of the serial numbers do not constitute<br>material alterations on the checks.<br><br>Incidentally, we agree with the petitioner's observation that the check  in the <i>PNB</i> case appears to belong to the same batch of checks as in the present case.   The check in the <i>PNB</i> case was also issued by the Ministry of Education and Culture.  It was also drawn against PNB, respondent in this case.  The serial number of the check in the <i>PNB</i> case is 7-3666-223-3 and it was issued on 7 August 1981.<br><br><b><i><center> Timeliness of Filing of Respondent's Motion for Reconsideration </center> </i></b><br>Respondent filed its motion for reconsideration of the 10 October 1991 Decision on 6 November 1991. Respondent's motion for reconsideration states that it received a copy of the 10 October 1991 Decision on 22 October 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  Thus, it appears that the motion for reconsideration was filed on time.  However, the Registry Return Receipt shows that counsel for respondent or his agent received a copy of the 10 October 1991 Decision on 16 October 1991,<sup> [19]</sup> not on 22 October 1991 as respondent claimed.  Hence, the Court of Appeals is correct when it noted that the motion for reconsideration was filed late.  Despite its late filing, the Court of Appeals resolved to admit the motion for reconsideration "in the interest of substantial justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>There are instances when rules of procedure are relaxed in the interest of justice.  However, in this case, respondent did not proffer any explanation for the late filing of the motion for reconsideration. Instead, there was a deliberate attempt to deceive the Court of Appeals by claiming that the copy of the 10 October 1991 Decision was received on 22 October 1991 instead of on 16 October 1991.  We find no justification for the posture taken by the Court of Appeals in admitting the motion for reconsideration. Thus, the late filing of the motion for reconsideration rendered the 10 October 1991 Decision final and executory.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>The 24-Hour Clearing Time</i></b><br></div><br>The Court will not rule on the proper application of  Central Bank Circular No. 580 in this case.
