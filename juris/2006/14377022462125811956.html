				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on <em><em>certiorari</em></em> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assails the May 31, 2005 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and July 28, 2005 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 84702 affirming the September 24, 2003 resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Social Security Commission (SSC) in SSC Case No. 6-14922-99.<p></p><p>Respondents Wellington and Flordeliza Brogada are the parents of Fermin B. Brogada who was allegedly employed by petitioner Asiatic Development Corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> from July 1994 up to his death in November 14, 1996. Respondents filed with the SSC a petition for social security coverage and payment of contributions in order to avail of the benefits accruing from the death of Fermin. They alleged that Fermin worked as survey aide under Engr. Bienvenido Orense, petitioner's geodetic engineer. Fermin was working on a project with Engr. Orense for one of petitioner's clients when he was shot and killed.</p><p>Petitioner denied its liability. It argued that there was no employer-employee relationship between it and Fermin. It claimed that Fermin was the employee of Engr. Orense. Thus, it was not obliged to report Fermin for social security coverage.</p><p>The SSC rendered judgment in favor of respondents:</p><blockquote>&nbsp; <p>WHEREFORE, this Commission finds, and so holds, that the late Fermin Brogada was an employee[,] subject to [social security] compulsory coverage, of [petitioner] for the period July 1994 to November 14, 1996.</p>&nbsp; <p>Accordingly, [petitioner] is hereby ordered to pay the [Social Security System], within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Resolution, the amount of PI 2,419.00 representing the unpaid [social security] contributions in favor of the late Fermin Brogada for the aforestated period of employment, the amount of P35.815.84 as 3% per month penalty for late payment computed as of October 31, 2003 without prejudice to the collection of additional penalty that may accrue thereafter until fully paid, and the amount of P32,000.00 as damages for failure to report Fermin Brogada for [social security] coverage prior to his death pursuant to Section 24(a) of the [Social Security] Law, as amended.</p>&nbsp; <p>The [Social Security System] is directed to immediately pay the lump sum death benefit to the [respondents], in their capacity as secondary beneficiaries, in accordance with its existing rules and regulations, and to inform this Commission of its compliance herewith.</p>&nbsp; <p>As to the [petitioner's] liability, if any under [Employer's Compensation] Law, the [Social Security System] is advised to take appropriate action for the collection of the same.</p>&nbsp; <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p></blockquote><p>On appeal, the SSC resolution was affirmed by the CA. Undaunted, petitioner filed this petition insisting that Fermin was not its employee.</p><p>The petition is denied.</p><p>The issue of whether or not an employer-employee relationship exists in a given case is essentially a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In petitions for review on <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45, only questions of law may be raised by the parties and passed upon by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Factual findings of quasi-judicial bodies like the SSC, when adopted and confirmed by the CA and if supported by substantial evidence, are accorded respect and even finality by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> While this Court has recognized several exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to this rule, none of these exceptions finds application here.</p><p>Both the SSC and CA found that Fermin was petitioner's employee. Thus, petitioner is liable for unpaid social security contributions.</p><p>Petitioner's claims are a mere reiteration of arguments unsuccessfully raised before the SSC and the CA. No compelling reason whatsoever is shown by petitioner for this Court to reverse the SSC's findings and conclusions, as affirmed by the CA.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is hereby DENIED. </p><p> Costs against petitioner. </p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><p><em>Puno (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Azcuna,</em> and<em> Garcia, JJ., </em>concur.</p><p><br>&nbsp; </p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned b-y Associate Justice Mariano C.
