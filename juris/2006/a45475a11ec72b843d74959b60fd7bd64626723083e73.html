NIETO, Intelligence Operative, Economic Intelligence Investigation Bureau, Department of Finance, and his witnesses Max Cavalera and David Lee Sealey that there are good and sufficient reasons to believe that Christopher Choi of No. 25-13 Columbia Street, Carmenville Subd., Angeles City has in his possession, control and custody <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[r]eams and packs of fake Marlboro Red Cigarettes, as well as cardboard cases of fake Marlboro Red Cigarettes (each cardboard case contains two (2) [m]aster [c]ases of Marlboro and each [m]aster case contains fifty (50) reams)</span> being distributed, kept and sold thereat in violation of Section 168, par. 2 and 3 (a) and (c) in relation to Section 169 of R.A. 8293;<br><br>You are hereby commanded to make an immediate search at anytime of the day or night of the above-premises and forthwith seize and take possession of the aforedescribed items found at the residence/warehouse of Christopher Choi at No. 25-13 Columbia Street, Carmenville Subd., Angeles City.<br><br>THEREFORE, seize and bring the said articles to the undersigned to be dealt with in accordance with law.<br><br>You are hereby further directed to submit a return within ten (10) days from today.<br><br>Given under my hand this 27th day of April, 1999 at Angeles City, Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The search was conducted on the same date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On May 12, 1999, respondent filed a motion to quash search warrant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and a "supplemental motion to quash"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> on June 22, 1999.  Both were denied by Judge Gatbalite in an order dated November 29, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Reconsideration was likewise denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On June 19, 2000, respondent filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> before the CA.  He alleged that Judge Gatbalite committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to quash the search warrant, arguing that probable cause was not sufficiently established as the examination conducted was not probing and exhaustive and the warrant did not particularly describe the place to be searched.  Respondent also prayed that Atty. Bennie Nicdao<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> be prohibited from using as evidence the articles seized by virtue of the search warrant.  This was granted by the CA in a decision dated April 10, 2002.<br><br>According to the CA, in determining whether there was probable cause to believe that the cigarettes purchased by Nieto were fake and in violation of RA 8293,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Judge Gatbalite failed to ask searching and probing questions of witness David Lee Sealey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The examination of Sealey went this way:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Court: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">There was testimony here given by Mr. Mario Nieto and Max Cavalera, that fake Marlboro cigarettes bought by them from Michael Chua, Christopher Choi and Johnny Chang were turned over to you for examination, is that correct? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">After the same had been turned over to you, what did you do with the said merchandise, if you did anything? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I examined the sample of cigarettes and their packaging bearing the Marlboro Trade Marks which were suspected to be produc[ed] and manufactured by La Suerte or [with] the permission of Philip Morris. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was the result of your examination? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Based on the packaging of the packs, the color of the box and the printing on the front side of the packs and the cigarettes themselves, I concluded that they are counterfeit or unauthorized product[s]. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you have any knowledge of this person named Christopher Choi? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">None, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">There is an affidavit here marked as exhibit, executed by one David Lee Sealey, do you know this David Lee Sealey? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor, I am the one. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Whose signature is this appearing on the printed name David Lee Sealey? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">This is my signature, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Do you affirm and confirm other contents of this affidavit? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Court: </div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">That's all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [17]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In addition, the CA ruled that Judge Gatbalite committed grave abuse of discretion when she merely relied on the conclusion of Sealey that the cigarettes he received from Nieto were fake. She should have at least required Sealey to present the alleged fake Marlboro cigarettes and the genuine ones for comparison, instead of relying on his testimony alone. The CA reasoned that this was an absolute requirement under the Supreme Court ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">20th Century Fox Film Corporation v. Court of Appeals</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]<br><br></sup>Hence, this petition.The People of the Philippines aver that the CA erred in finding that Judge Gatbalite committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the search warrant allegedly because she failed to determine probable cause pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 126 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  The People assail the finding of the CA that, in issuing the search warrant, Judge Gatbalite purportedly did not comply strictly with the requirement to determine the existence of probable cause by personally examining the applicant and his witnesses through searching questions and answers.  The People also assert that the CA erred in applying the doctrine in <span style="font-style: italic;">20th Century Fox Film Corporation</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> since it had already been superseded by <span style="font-style: italic;">Columbia Pictures, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We rule for the People of the Philippines.<br><br>Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 126 state:<br><blockquote>Sec. 4. <span style="font-style: italic;">Requisites for issuing search warrant</span>.  A search warrant shall not issue except upon probable cause in connection with one specific offense to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the things to be seized which may be anywhere in the Philippines.<br><br>Sec. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Examination of complainant; record.</span>  The judge must, before issuing the warrant, personally examine in the form of searching questions and answers, in writing and under oath, the complainant and the witnesses he may produce on facts personally known to them and attach to the record their sworn statements, together with the affidavits submitted.<br></blockquote>According to the foregoing provisions, a search warrant  can be issued only upon a finding of probable cause. Probable cause means such facts and circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed and that the objects sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be searched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The determination of the existence of probable cause requires the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) the judge must examine the complainant and his witnesses personally;<br><br>(2) the examination must be under oath and<br><br>(3) the examination must be reduced in writing in the form of searching questions and answers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></div><br>The searching questions propounded to the applicant and the witnesses depend largely on the discretion of the judge. Although there is no hard-and-fast rule governing how a judge should conduct his examination, it is axiomatic that the examination must be probing and exhaustive, not merely routinary, general, peripheral, perfunctory or pro-forma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  The judge must not simply rehash the contents of the affidavit but must make his own inquiry on the intent and justification of the application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  The questions should not merely be repetitious of the averments stated in the affidavits or depositions of the applicant and the witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  If the judge fails to determine probable cause by personally examining the applicant and his witnesses in the form of searching questions before issuing a search warrant, grave abuse of discretion is committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The determination of probable cause does not call for the application of rules and standards of proof that a judgment of conviction requires after trial on the merits. As the term implies, probable cause is concerned with probability, not absolute or even moral certainty.  The standards of judgment are those of a reasonably prudent man, not the exacting calibrations of a judge after a full-blown trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  No law or rule states that probable cause requires a specific kind of evidence.  No formula or fixed rule for its determination exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  Probable cause is determined in the light of conditions obtaining in a given situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  The entirety of the questions propounded by the court and the answers thereto must be considered by the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]<br><br></sup>In this case, aside from the testimony of Sealey, petitioner judge also heard the testimony of applicant Nieto:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">In connection with Search Warrant 99-17, are you the same Mario Nieto who is the applicant in this application for search warrant filed today April 27, 1999? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Do you know this Christopher Choi referred to herein? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Why do you know him? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He was introduced to us by Michael Chua, your Honor. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">As what? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">As the supplier for the goods. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Subject of the application? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor, in violation of Section 169 of R.A. 8293. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">How did you know him? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">A: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When I was conducting a test-buy operation against Mr. Michael Chua, Mr. Michael Chua told me that the bulk of supply if we need more supply we can get from the source, a certain Christopher Choi, who lives in the same village and who is actually the supplier for the entire region. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="left">Q:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Where did you see him.

On April 23, 1999 at about 8:30 p.m., Mario Nieto and I again went to the subject place to conduct a test-buy operation. [A]fter Mr. Choi had been convinced of our intention to buy cigarettes from him, he brought us to his warehouse where he showed to us several cardboard cases of Marlboro cigarettes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>Given the foregoing testimonies and applying the established standards in determining probable cause, we cannot say that Judge Gatbalite committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the search warrant.  Her questions were sufficiently probing, not at all superficial and perfunctory.  The testimonies were consistent with each other and the narration of facts was credible. The testimonies and other evidence on record constituted adequate bases to establish probable cause that the alleged offense had been committed.<br><br>Since probable cause is dependent largely on the opinion and findings of the judge who conducted the examination and who had the opportunity to question the applicant and his witnesses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the findings of the judge deserve great weight. The reviewing court can overturn such findings only upon proof that the judge disregarded the facts before him or ignored the clear dictates of reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> We thus find no reason to disturb Judge Gatbalite's findings.<br><br>Furthermore, as correctly pointed out by petitioners, <span style="font-style: italic;">20th Century Fox Film Corporation</span>, insofar as it required the presentation of the master tapes for comparison with the pirated copies for a search warrant to issue, had already been superseded by <span style="font-style: italic;">Columbia Pictures, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</span>:<br><blockquote>More to the point, it is felt that the reasonableness of the added requirement in <span style="font-style: italic;">20th Century Fox</span> calling for the production of the master tapes of the copyrighted films for determination of probable cause in copyright infringement cases needs revisiting and clarification.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx    xxx    xxx<br></div><br>In fine, the supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">pronunciamento </span>in said case regarding the necessity for the presentation of the master tapes of the copyrighted films for the validity of search warrants should at most be understood to merely serve as a guidepost in determining the existence of probable cause in copyright infringement cases <span style="font-style: italic;">where there is doubt as to the true nexus between the master tape and the pirated copies.</span> An objective and careful reading of the decision in said case could lead to no other conclusion than that <span style="font-weight: bold;">said directive was hardly intended to be a sweeping and inflexible requirement in all or similar copyright infringement cases.</span> Judicial dicta should always be construed within the factual matrix of their parturition, otherwise a careless interpretation thereof could unfairly fault the writer with the vice of overstatement and the reader with the fallacy of undue generalization.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx    xxx    xxx<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is evidently incorrect to suggest, as the ruling in 20th Century Fox may appear to do, that in copyright infringement cases, the presentation of master tapes of the copyrighted films is always necessary to meet the requirement of probable cause and that, in the absence thereof, there can be no finding of probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.</span> It is true that such master tapes are object evidence, with the merit that in this class of evidence the ascertainment of the controverted fact is made through demonstrations involving the direct use of the senses of the presiding magistrate.  Such auxiliary procedure, however, does not rule out the use of testimonial or documentary evidence, depositions, admissions or other classes of evidence tending to prove the <span style="font-style: italic;">factum probandum</span>, especially where the production in court of object evidence would result in delay, inconvenience or expenses out of proportion to its evidentiary value.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx    xxx    xxx<br></div><br>Accordingly, to restrict the exercise of discretion by a judge by adding a particular requirement (the presentation of master tapes, as intimated by <span style="font-style: italic;">20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox</span>) not provided nor implied in the law for a finding of probable cause is beyond the realm of judicial competence or statesmanship.  It serves no purpose but to stultify and constrict the judicious exercise of a court's prerogatives and to denigrate the judicial duty of determining the existence of probable cause to a mere ministerial or mechanical function.  There is, to repeat, no law or rule which requires that the existence of probable cause is or should be determined solely by a specific kind of evidence.  Surely, this could not have been contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, and we do not believe that the Court intended the statement in <span style="font-style: italic;">20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox</span> regarding master tapes as the dictum for all seasons and reasons in infringement cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is obvious that <span style="font-style: italic;">20th Century Fox Film Corporation</span> should not be applied to the present case since this involves the offense of unfair competition and not copyright infringement. More importantly, as pronounced by the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Columbia Pictures, Inc.</span>, the judge's exercise of discretion should not be unduly restricted by adding a requirement that is not sanctioned by law.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.
