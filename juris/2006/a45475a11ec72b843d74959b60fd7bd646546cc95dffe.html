				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In issue in the present Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is whether respondent, Mariquit Soriano (Mariquit), was forced to resign, due to professional and sexual harassment, thus amounting to constructive dismissal.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) held in the negative.  The Court of Appeals held otherwise.<br><br>From the records of the case, the following antecedent facts are culled:<br><br>In the third quarter of 1998, petitioner Digitel Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (Digitel) hired Mariquit, then of 48 summers, a Bachelor of Science in Nutrition graduate from the University of the Philippines and a graduate school student of De La Salle University (she had not submitted her thesis), as Director for Market and Communications effective August 15, 1998.<br><br>Digitel's co-petitioners Senior Vice President for Business Division Eric J. Severino (Severino) and Senior Executive Vice President Johnson Robert L. Go (Go) were Mariquit's immediate superior and next higher superior, respectively.<br><br>Working under Mariquit were Evelyn P. Inductivo (Evelyn), Manager of the Promotion Section, Andrea S. Arnedo (Andrea), Manager of the Corporate and Planning Information Section, and Joselito Macachor (Macachor),  Ad and Promo Manager.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In the Performance Review conducted by Digitel for the period of August 17, 1998 up to February 15, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Mariquit obtained for her first six months of work a rating of 92% (Above Average).<br><br>Mariquit later had a rift with Macachor regarding an advertisement error.  She thus sought his termination through petitioner Severino.  To her dismay, Severino merely arranged for the transfer of Macachor to another department.<br><br>Mariquit's performance soon began to deteriorate.  The Performance Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for the period of April 1, 1999 up to April 1, 2000 showed that she obtained a rating of 60% (Average) with the following notes from petitioner Severino:<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REVIEW OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE:</span></span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">(Special comments on performance in particular work areas, overall performance

original;  underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Apparently in an attempt to shift the blame on the unfavorable evaluation made on her, Mariquit gave unfavorable evaluation of her two remaining managers, Evelyn and Andrea.<br><br>In a Memorandum of June 27, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> addressed to Severino, Evelyn questioned the basis of her rating and charged Mariquit of "harassing and framing-up her very own managers."  And she also charged Mariquit of violating company rules and regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>For her part Andrea, in a Memorandum of May 15, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> also addressed to Severino, challenged the factual basis of her poor performance rating and appealed for a new evaluation, she attributing as possible motive of Mariquit her "hatred, prejudice, revenge and a desire to get rid" of her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Mariquit's personal conflicts with her two managers continued, prompting her to also demand the termination of their services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  As in the case of Macachor, the management retained them, however.<br><br>Mariquit later filed on June 27, 2000 a letter of resignation bearing the date June 28, 2000, to take effect at the closing of office hours on June 30, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  Severino acknowledged receipt of the letter of resignation which Mariquit left in his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Severino thereafter forwarded the letter to the Human Resources Department where it was stamped "received" on June 28, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 22, 2000, Mariquit executed a Deed of Quitclaim and Release<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> acknowledging receipt from Digitel of the sum of P97,560.02, and declaring therein that her resignation on June 30, 2000 was of her own free will and that in consideration of the said amount, she was releasing and forever discharging Digitel, its officers, managers or representatives or successors from all claims or cause in connection with her employment therewith.<br><br>About five months after her execution of the Deed of Quitclaim and Release or in January 2001, on the intercession of Mariquit's friend Emma Teodoro (Emma), Go and Mariquit, together with Emma, met during which Mariquit is said to have pleaded for financial assistance.  Go thus referred her to Digitel Executive Vice President Policarpio B. Pau, Jr. (Pau).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Pau was to later relate what transpired when Mariquit went to see him.<br><br>Eleven months after her resignation letter was filed or on May 28, 2001, Mariquit filed criminal complaints against petitioners Go and Severino,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for violation of R.A. 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Law) and/or Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (Acts of Lasciviousness), before the Quezon City Prosecutors Office which referred the complaints to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).<br><br>The NBI recommended to the City Prosecutor the filing of a case for sexual harassment against petitioner Go.  The City Prosecutor later dismissed Mariquit's complaints but, on her motion for reconsideration, it issued a Resolution finding probable cause to hale Go to court for acts of lasciviousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  Go appealed the Resolution to the Department of Justice (DOJ).<br><br>In Pau's affidavit dated July 6, 2001 which Go submitted in connection with Mariquit's criminal complaint against him, Pau gave the following account of what transpired during his meeting with Mariquit after Go had, as stated above, referred her to him.<blockquote>x x x x<br><ol start="14"><li> Sometime in January 2001 Ms. Soriano and her son went to my office;  She told me

Clara, it is readily gathered that they are hearsay.  The Labor Arbiter thus correctly discredited them as such, as it did correctly observe that Mariquit failed to present a single witness to corroborate her charges.  At any rate, why Mariquit, for the first time raised the issue of sexual harassment which was, in the case of Go, allegedly committed on five occasions from May 1999 to February 11, 2000 only on May 28, 2001 when she filed criminal complaints against herein individual petitioners, about 11 months after her resignation or two years after the first alleged occurrence, she did not even proffer the reason therefor.<br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> however, Mariquit argues that "there is no prescription that would bar the filing of cases involving sexual harassment [as] the period varies depending on the needs, circumstances, and emotional threshold of the employee."  She cites <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Aelous Automotive United Corporation v. NLRC</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> wherein the complainant therein cried sexual harassment after four years and this Court held:<blockquote>x x x  Strictly speaking, there is no time period within which he or she [alleged victim of sexual harassment] is expected to complain through the proper channels. The time to do so may vary depending upon the needs, circumstances, and more importantly, the emotional threshold of the employee.<br><br>Private respondent admittedly allowed four (4) years to pass before finally coming out with her employer's sexual impositions. Not many women, especially in this country, are made of the stuff that can endure the agony and trauma of a public, even corporate, scandal.  x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote>The Labor Arbiter before which Mariquit also cited <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Aelous</span> brushed aside the same in this wise:<blockquote>The ruling in the above-cited case does not squarely apply to the present case.  In that [case], the complainant thereat, Ms. Rosalinda C. Cortez, did not resign from her job; she did not undergo psychological treatment; and she was not an executive of the company she worked with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Aelous</span>, the therein complainant employee Rosalinda raised the issue of sexual harassment as soon as she had the opportunity to do so. Thus, after the company issued a memorandum terminating her employment in November 1994, she filed a complaint before the Labor Arbiter on December 6, 1994, raising the issue of sexual harassment committed four years earlier by her superior who had charged her of committing gross acts of disrespect.  The earliest opportunity for her to cry foul thus came only after she was terminated in November 1994.<br><br>It bears noting that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Aelous</span>, this Court observed: "If petitioner [Philippine Aelous] had not issued the third memorandum that terminated the services of private respondent, we could only speculate how much longer she would keep her silence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>If Rosalinda kept her silence, she must have done so out of fear of losing her job.  When, however, she was fired, she immediately broke her silence.<br><br>The case of Mariquit is different.  She voluntarily submitted on June 27, 2000 a letter of resignation dated June 28, 2000, to become effective on June 30, 2000.  She subsequently executed a Deed of Quitclaim and Release on August 22, 2000.  There was no reason for her to be afraid of losing her job or not getting anything from Digitel. Still, she waited for about 11 months, counted from the date of filing of her letter of resignation or about nine months counted from the day she executed the Deed of Quitclaim and Release before she, for the first time, charged herein individual petitioners with sexual harassment.<br><br>While, as this Court stated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Aelous</span>, there is, strictly speaking, no fixed period within which an alleged victim of sexual harassment may file a complaint, it does not mean that she or he is at liberty to file one anytime she or he wants to.  Surely, any delay in filing a complaint must be justifiable or reasonable as not to cast doubt on its merits.<br><br>At all events, it is settled that the only test of whether an alleged fact or circumstance is worthy of credence is the common experience, knowledge and observation of ordinary men.<br><br>As New Jersey Vice Chancellor Van Fleet stated in the often-cited case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Daggers v.

It was at this time, according to her, that Go "reached out his hand and groped [her] breast, caressed [her] back and reached inside [her] blouse to rub [her] from up [her] brassieres down to [her] buttocks."  Since this alleged incident occurred while Mariquit and Go were dancing, and surely there were a lot of people around in the well lighted small area as stated by house owner Pau, would Go be that maniacal to forego the respect accorded to him by virtue of his high position?  To be sure, a person who holds a very exalted position would normally behave at social gatherings, unless he is a proven maniac, to deserve that respect.<br><br>Petitioners Go and Severino, on the other hand, presented affidavits of persons who were present during the time when alleged incidents took place and who declared in effect that no such incidents did take place and could have taken place.  The appellate court dismissed the claim of these affiants, however, as "obviously biased in favor of [petitioners], their superior and employer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Lufthansa German Airlines v.

Our attempts were futile as Ms. Ruiz kept avoiding to meet Ms. Soriano. I can only conclude that such evasion on the part of Ms. Ruiz is because she and other Digitel employee were warned against testifying for Ms. Soriano under pains of dismissal from the company.</li><li>x x x x</li></ol><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo</span>, p. 147.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Annex "E," NLRC records, p. 94.
