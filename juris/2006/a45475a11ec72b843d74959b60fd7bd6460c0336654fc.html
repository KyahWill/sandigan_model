SP.

Petitioners Leo Cleto A. Gamolo (Gamolo) and Reynold P. Molo (Molo) are members of the Board of Directors of petitioner Strongworld. On 31 October 1997, petitioners filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for Sum of Money and Damages with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Muntinlupa City, Branch 276, presided over by the Hon. N. C. Perello, and docketed as Civil Case No. 97-222, against private respondents First People's Bank (formerly known as Rural Bank of San Teodoro), Bank of Commerce, Orlando O. Francisco (Francisco), and Editha Lizarda (Lizarda).<br><br>In their Complaint, petitioners alleged, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, that: in 1996, Rizal Cement Company, Inc. delivered to petitioner Strongworld four (4) checks<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as payment for the construction of housing units;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> at the time of the issuance of the aforesaid checks, petitioner Strongworld maintained a single account with private respondent Bank of Commerce, San Pedro Branch,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> with private respondents Francisco, former president of petitioner Strongworld, and its incumbent president, petitioner Gamolo as authorized signatories; the subject checks were not deposited to the account of petitioner Strongworld; instead, private respondents Francisco and Lizarda, conspiring and confederating between themselves and with the employees of private respondent First People's Bank, maliciously and fraudulently diverted the checks to their personal accounts, specifically First People's Bank Savings Account No. 51-03025-5, without the knowledge and consent of petitioners Gamolo and Molo, and without authority from the Board of Directors of petitioner Strongworld;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and that repeated demands against the private respondents were not heeded resulting in the damage and prejudice of petitioners.<br><br>The petitioners prayed for the following reliefs:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>Ordering the defendants to pay plaintiff Strongworld, jointly and severally, the amount of P5,085,615.22 constituting the value of plaintiff corporation's checks, and P3,000,000.00, constituting lost profits, interest and other expenses which resulted by reason of the illegal acts of defendants.<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendants to pay plaintiffs, jointly and severally, a) P3,000,000.00 by way of moral damages divided as follows: i) plaintiff Gamolo P1,500,000.00, ii) plaintiff Molo P750,000.00, and iii) plaintiff Strongworld P750,000.00; b) P100,000.00 exemplary damages; and c) P200,000.00 attorney's fees.<br></li></ol>Other reliefs just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>On 2 December 1997, private respondent Bank of Commerce filed an Answer with Cross-Claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> praying for the dismissal of the Complaint. Subsequent thereto, private respondent Lizarda filed an Answer with Counterclaim and Cross-Claim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated 12 December 1997. On 11 December 1997, private respondent First People's Bank filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> on the grounds that petitioners Gamolo and Molo had no legal capacity to sue, and that the Complaint stated no cause of action. On 9 January 1998, petitioners filed an Opposition to Motion to Dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On 9 January 1998, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dismissing the Complaint. We quote the pertinent portion hereunder:<br><blockquote>From the allegations of the COMPLAINT, it appears that money sought to be recovered belongs to the Corporation and who allegedly was damaged due to the unauthorized expenditure of this sum. Therefore, Plaintiff Leo Cleto A. Gamolo and Reynaldo P. Molo, although, admittedly are officers of the corporation appear to have instituted this action for and in behalf of the corporation, yet their authority to sue or defend the corporation has not been shown in this COMPLAINT. No Board Resolution for this purpose has been attached or recited in it. Thus this complaint is not prosecuted by the proper property in interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>On 30 January 1998, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which was opposed by private respondent First People's Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 30 March 1998, the trial court granted petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, and consequently, ordered the case reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>   According to the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, the board resolution authorizing petitioner Gamolo to prosecute the case in behalf of petitioner Strongworld was defective for not having been authenticated by the proper officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> However, notwithstanding the defect in the resolution, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> held that the intention of petitioner Strongworld to authorize Gamolo to prosecute the case against private respondents is clear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> On 30 April 1998, private respondent First People's Bank filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the 30 March 1998 Order, praying for the dismissal of the Complaint. On 25 May 1998, petitioners belatedly filed an Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> thereto.<br><br>In the interim, on 7 May 1998, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> issued an Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> recalling its Order of 30 March 1998. The trial court declared that the case should remain dismissed on the ground that petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dated 9 January 1998, dismissing the Complaint, was not served on private respondents Bank of Commerce, Francisco and Lizarda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Moreover, the trial court opined that it was in error when it considered petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, as no proof of service to private respondents was shown therein, and the same lacked a notice of hearing, which defects rendered the aforesaid Motion for Reconsideration, a mere scrap of paper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, petitioners apparently filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the 7 May 1998 Order, a copy of which cannot be found on the records.   On 29 May 1998, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> rendered an Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> denying the motion and finding no reason to reconsider its Order of 7 May 1998.<br><br>On 15 June 1998, petitioners filed a Motion for Clarification and/or Reconsideration and for Declaration of Default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> They sought, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, for clarification of the Order dated 7 May 1998, positing that the dismissal should only pertain to private respondent First People's Bank. They also prayed that the 7 May 1998 Order be declared as superseded by the Order of 29 May 1998. In the alternative, they prayed that the 7 May 1998 Order be reconsidered and set aside, that the Complaint be reinstated, and that private respondents First People's Bank and Francisco be declared in default.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Resolving petitioners' Motion for Clarification, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in open court, dated 17 July 1998,  reiterating that the case should remain dismissed as petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was defective, and hence, unbinding against the Order of 7 May 1998. Similarly, the trial court corrected the Order of 29 May 1998 to refer to the Order of 7 May 1998, which sustained the dismissal of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> reasoned, thus:<br><blockquote>Even as the MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION by the Plaintiff was not assailed by the other Defendant, but due to lack of notification, this Motion should not have been received by the Court at all, therefore [it] is a mere scrap of paper which requires no ruling.<br><ol><li>A motion that does not contain a notice of hearing is a mere scrap of paper, it represents no question which merits the attention of the Court. (Goldloop Properties, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 212 SCRA 498).<br><br></li><li>Rule 15, Sec. 4. Hearing of motion- Except for motions which the Court may act upon without prejudicing the rights of the adverse party, every written motion shall be set for hearing by the applicant.<br><br></li><li>Every written motion required to be heard and the notice of the hearing thereof shall be served in such a manner to ensure its receipt by the other party at least three (3) days before the date of hearing unless the Court for good cause sets the hearing on shorter notice.<br><br></li><li>Sec. 5, Notice of hearing - The notice of hearing shall be addressed to all parties concerned, and shall specify the time and date of the hearing which must not be later than ten (10) days after the filing of the motion.<br><br></li><li>Sec. 6, Proof of service necessary - No written motion set for hearing shall be acted upon by the Court without proof of service thereof.<br><br></li><li>Any motion that does not contain proof of service of notice to the other party is not entitled to judicial cognizance. (Cui vs. Madayag, 245 SCRA 1).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Aggrieved, petitioners filed a Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> with the Court of Appeals, assailing the Orders of the RTC dated 7 May 1998 and 17 July 1998. The Petition likewise sought to annul the Order of the RTC dated 9 January 1998, dismissing the Complaint, which was later revived by the Order of 7 May 1998.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> for utilizing the wrong recourse of certiorari, instead of an ordinary appeal. The appellate court said that the Complaint was finally dismissed on 17 July 1998. Thus, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Denso (Phils.), Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it held that the dismissal of the Complaint is a final order which disposed of the action, and the remedy of a party aggrieved of a final order or judgment is appeal under Section 1, Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, and not a special civil action of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 65 thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In dismissing the Petition, the Court of Appeals, in part, declared:<br><blockquote>As earlier said, however Our Supreme Court has held that if a party essays a course by the wrong procedure, the only recourse of action open is to dismiss the case (<span style="font-style: italic;">Murillo vs. Rodolfo Consul, UDK 9748, 182 SCRA XI (sic))</span>. The remedy of appeal being available to the petitioners, it cannot resort to Certiorari (<span style="font-style: italic;">Felizardo vs. Court of Appeals, 233 SCRA 220</span>).<br><br>It is settled that a special civil action for certiorari will not lie as a substitute for the last (sic) remedy of appeal <span style="font-style: italic;">(Dela Paz v. Panis, 245 SCRA 242)</span> and we find no special nor compelling reasons why we should make out this case as an exception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners moved for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> thereon, but the same was denied by the Court of Appeals in the assailed Order promulgated on 2 April 2001.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Assignment of Errors</span><br></div><br>Hence, petitioners come to us via the instant Petition for Review, submitting that the Court of Appeals erred, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz:</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><blockquote>IN RULING THAT APPEAL IS THE PROPER REMEDY AND PETITION FOR <span style="font-style: italic;">CERTIORARI </span>IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE PRESENT CASE;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>IN NOT FINDING THAT APPEAL IS NOT THE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO PETITIONER'S (sic) MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>IN NOT FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN NOT REINSTATING THE COMPLAINTS (sic) AND IN FAILING TO CONSIDER THAT THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN: 1) DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT ON THE GROUND THAT A BOARD RESOLUTION WAS NOT RECITED IN OR ATTACHED TO THE COMPLAINT; 2) IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT EVEN AGAINST THE RESPONDENTS WHO DID NOT FILE A MOTION TO DISMISS AND WHO DID NOT RAISE THE SAME GROUNDS RELIED UPON BY THE TRIAL COURT IN DISMISSING THE COMPLAINT; 3) IN REINSTATING ITS JANUARY 9, 1998 ORDER AND IN NOT RECALLING THE JANUARY 9, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Issue</span><br style="font-style: italic;"></div><br>For our resolution is whether the appellate court was in error when it dismissed petitioners' Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> on the ground that appeal was the appropriate remedy under Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, and not a Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari,</span> under Rule 65 thereof.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>At the outset, attention must be called to Section 1, Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Subject of appeal</span>. - An appeal may be taken from a judgment or final order that completely disposes of the case, or of a particular matter therein when declared by these Rules to be appealable:<br><br>No appeal may be taken from:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) An order denying a motion for new trial or reconsideration;<br><br>(b) An order denying a petition for relief or any similar motion seeking relief from judgment;<br><br>(c) An interlocutory order;<br><br>(d) An order disallowing or dismissing an appeal;<br><br>(e) An order denying a motion to set aside a judgment by consent, confession or compromise on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress, or any other ground vitiating consent;<br><br>(f) An order of execution;<br><br>(g) A judgment or final order for or against one or more of several parties or in separate claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party complaints, while the main case is pending, unless the court allows an appeal therefrom; and<br><br>(h) An order dismissing an action without prejudice;<br></div><br>In all the above instances where the judgment or final order is not appealable, the aggrieved party may file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65.<br></blockquote>From the foregoing, it is evident that under Section 1(h), Rule 41, no appeal may be taken from an order dismissing an action without prejudice. In such a case, the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure states that the remedy available to the aggrieved party is to file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65.<br><br>Jurisprudence has similarly underscored that with the advent of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, an order of dismissal without prejudice is no longer appealable, as expressly provided by Section 1(h), Rule 41 thereof. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation v. Philippine Infrastructures, Inc.</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court had the opportunity to resolve whether an order dismissing a petition without prejudice should be appealed by way of ordinary appeal, petition for review on certiorari or a petition for certiorari. The Court said that, indeed, prior to the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, an order dismissing an action may be appealed by ordinary appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Verily, Section 1, Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure recites the instances when appeal may not be taken, specifically, in case of an order dismissing an action <span style="font-style: italic;">without </span>prejudice, in which case, the remedy available to the aggrieved party is Rule 65.<br><br>Thus, the question is: was the Order of the RTC, dated 7 May 1998, reviving the 9 January 1998 Order, which dismissed the Complaint, an order dismissing an action without prejudice?<br><br>We distinguish a dismissal with prejudice from a dismissal without prejudice. The former disallows and bars the refiling of the complaint; whereas, the same cannot be said of a dismissal without prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Likewise, where the law permits, a dismissal with prejudice is subject to the right of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>To resolve the issue before us, it is critical to examine the Order of dismissal rendered by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>. It can be recalled that on 9 January 1998, the trial court issued an Order dismissing petitioners' Complaint, on the ground that petitioners Gamolo and Molo had not shown their authority to sue for and in behalf of petitioner Strongworld. Subsequently, on petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, the RTC reconsidered its 9 January 1998 Order of dismissal. Hence, on 30 March 1998, the RTC ordered the case reinstated. However, on 7 May 1998, upon Motion for Reconsideration of private respondent First People's Bank, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> recalled the Order of 30 March 1998. The recall by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> of the Order dated 30 March 1998 reinstated the Order dated 9 January 1998, which dismissed the Complaint. Finally, on 17 July 1998, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, upon petitioners' Motion for Clarification, enunciated that the Order of 7 May 1998, dismissing the case, is sustained.<br><br>As can be gleaned therefrom, the trial court's order of dismissal of 9 January 1998, was founded on the ground that the action was not instituted by the proper party in interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The trial court held that petitioners Gamolo and Molo, although admittedly officers of petitioner Strongworld, appear to have instituted the action for and in behalf of petitioner Strongworld, yet, their authority to sue or defend the corporation had not been shown in the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> No board resolution for the purpose had been attached or recited in the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence states that if the suit is not brought in the name of, or against, the real party in interest, a Motion to Dismiss may be filed on the ground that the Complaint states no cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Section 1(g), Rule 16 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure allows the filing of a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the Complaint states no cause of action. Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aguila, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we pronounced:<br><blockquote>A real party in interest is one who would be benefited or injured by the judgment, or who is entitled to the avails of the suit. This ruling is now embodied in Rule 3, Section 2 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure. Any decision rendered against a person who is not a real party in interest in the case cannot be executed. Hence, a complaint filed against such a person should be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 1, Rule 16 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure enumerates the grounds for which a Motion to Dismiss may be filed, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.:</span><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Grounds. - Within the time for but before filing the answer to the complaint or pleading asserting a claim, a motion to dismiss may be made on any of the following grounds:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) That the court has no jurisdiction over the person of the defending party;<br><br>(b) That the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim;<br><br>(c) That venue is improperly laid;<br><br>(d) That the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue;<br><br>(e) That there is another action pending between the same parties for the same cause;<br><br>(f) That the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations;<br><br>(g) That the pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action;<br><br>(h) That the claim or demand set forth in the plaintiff's pleading has been paid, waived, abandoned, or otherwise extinguished;<br><br>(i) That the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of the statute of frauds; and<br><br>(j) That a condition precedent for filing the claim has not been complied with.<br></div></blockquote>Section 5 of the same Rule, recites the effect of a dismissal under Sections 1(f),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (h),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and (i),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> thereof, thus:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <span style="font-style: italic;">Effect of dismissal</span>. - Subject to the right of appeal, an order granting a motion to dismiss based on paragraphs (f), (h), and (i) of section 1 hereof shall bar the refiling of the same action or claim.<br></blockquote>Briefly stated, dismissals that are based on the following grounds, to wit: (1) that the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment or by the statute of limitations; (2) that the claim or demand set forth in the plaintiff's pleading has been paid, waived, abandoned or otherwise extinguished; and (3) that the claim on which the action is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of the statute of frauds, bar the refiling of the same action or claim. Logically, the nature of the dismissal founded on any of the preceding grounds is "with prejudice" because the dismissal prevents the refiling of the same action or claim. Ergo, dismissals based on the rest of the grounds enumerated are without prejudice because they do not preclude the refiling of the same action.<br><br>Verily, the dismissal of petitioners' Complaint by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a </span>quo was not based on any of the grounds specified in Section 5, Rule 16 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure; rather, it was grounded on what was encapsulated in Section 1(g), Rule 16 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure. As the trial court ratiocinated in its 9 January 1998 Order, the Complaint is not prosecuted by the proper party in interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Considering the heretofore discussion, we can say that the order of dismissal was based on the ground that the Complaint states no cause of action.   For this reason, the dismissal of petitioners' Complaint cannot be said to be a dismissal with prejudice which bars the refiling of the same action.<br><br>As has been earlier quoted, Section 1(h), Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that no appeal may be taken from an order dismissing an action without prejudice. The same section provides that in such an instant where the final order is not appealable, the aggrieved party may file an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65.<br><br>The appellate court erred, thus, when it pronounced in its Decision of 24 May 2000 that petitioners' remedy is appeal under Section 1, Rule 41 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>A Petition for<span style="font-style: italic;"> Certiorar</span>i under Rule 65 is available in cases when there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. In the case at bar, appeal of the 7 May 1998 Order,  reviving the Order of 9 January 1998, which dismissed petitioners' Complaint, and as reiterated in the 17 July 1998 Order is not a remedy available to petitioners as aggrieved parties.<br><br>In sum, the appellate court erred when it ruled that petitioners' Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> filed before it was not the proper remedy. The dismissal of the Complaint being without prejudice, the remedy available to the aggrieved party is Rule 65.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>. The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 49462, dated 24 May 2000 and 2 April 2001 are hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE</span>. This case is  <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> to the Court of Appeals which is directed to hear and decide petitioners' Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> with utmost dispatch.
