SP No. 78752 which denied the petition for certiorari filed by herein petitioners Greater Metropolitan Manila Solid Waste Management Committee (GMMSWMC) and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and their Motion for Reconsideration, respectively.<br><br>In 1994, Presidential Memorandum Order No. 202 was issued by then President Fidel V. Ramos creating an Executive Committee to oversee and develop waste-to-energy projects for the waste disposal sites in San Mateo, Rizal and Carmona, Cavite under the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) scheme.<br><br>Respondent Jancom International Development Projects Pty.

Estrada.<br><br>Owing to the clamor of the residents of Rizal, the Estrada administration ordered the closure of the San Mateo landfill.  Petitioner GMMSWMC thereupon adopted a Resolution not to pursue the contract with JANCOM, citing as reasons therefor the passage of Republic Act 8749, otherwise known as the Clean Air Act of 1999, the non-availability of the San Mateo site, and costly tipping fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The Board of Directors of Jancom International thereafter adopted on January 4, 2000 a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> authorizing Atty.

From the moment of perfection, the parties are bound not only to the fulfillment of what has been expressly stipulated but also to all the consequences which, according to their nature, may be in keeping with good faith, usage, and law (Article 1315, Civil Code).  The contract has the force of law between the parties and they are expected to abide in good faith by their respective contractual commitments, not weasel out of them.  Just as nobody can be forced to enter into a contract, in the same manner, once a contract is entered into, no party can renounce it unilaterally or without the consent of the other.  It is a general principle of law that no one may be permitted to change his mind or disavow and go back upon his own acts, or to proceed contrary thereto, to the prejudice of the other party.  Nonetheless, it has to be repeated that <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">although the contract is a perfected one, it is still ineffective or unimplementable until and unless it is approved by the President.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis and Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>This Court's April 10, 2002 Resolution also in G.R.

As to the necessity, expediency, and wisdom of the contract, these are outside the realm of judicial adjudication.  These considerations are primarily and exclusively a matter for the President to decide.  While the Court recognizes that the garbage problem is a matter of grave public concern, it can only declare that the contract in question is a valid and perfected one between the parties, but the same is <span style="font-weight: bold;">   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">still ineffective or unimplementable until andunless it is approved by the President, the contract itself providingthat such approval by the President is necessary for itseffectivity</span>.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis and Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Article 19 of the contract provides:<br><blockquote>Article 19.
