It should have been sworn as he is not a Postmaster General.

Eduarte as hearing officer and Rafael S. Suangco and Guiling Manalocan as prosecuting officers.  Consequently, the injunction prayed for is hereby granted.  Mrs. Lilia Eduarte, Rafael Suangco and Guiling Manalocan are hereby enjoined from proceeding with the hearing.<br><br>Respondent Alfredo Estrera may however, refile again the formal charge.  In so doing he should observe the Disciplinary Rules and Procedures of the Philippine Postal Corporation and Circular No. 97-29.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner no longer filed a motion for reconsideration of the foregoing RTC Order and proceeded to file a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>with the CA which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 67944. <br><br>On January 10, 2002, the CA issued the first assailed Resolution, stating thus:<br><blockquote>However, after going over this petition, it was found out that petitioners failed to attach or incorporate the authority of Alfredo O. Estrera who signed the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping to sign for and in behalf of petitioner Lilia F. Eduarte in violation of Section 3, paragraph 3, Rule 46 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, hence, dismissible.<br><br>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, this petition is hereby ordered <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner did not to file a motion for reconsideration of the foregoing Resolution and instead filed another petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the CA on February 8, 2002, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 69407.  On March 13, 2002, the CA issued a Resolution, to wit:<br><br><center>RESOLUTION<br></center><blockquote>Upon examination of the present Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span>, with prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order, and it appearing that:<br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>a) The petition assails the Orders dated August 21, 2001 and October 24, 2001, granting a temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction, respectively, issued by respondent Judge Leonardo Demecillo of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City, Branch 24, in Civil Case No. 2001-190, entitled: "Venus Kavoori, Petitioner versus Alfredo Estrera, et al., Respondents," which were previously the subjects of another petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order earlier filed with this Court by Alfredo O. Estrera and Lilia F. Eduarte, and docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 67944, which was dismissed by the former Fifteenth Division on January 10, 2002.  Except for the exclusion of Lilia F. Eduarte, <b>the present petition, which is filed solely by Alfredo O. Estrera, appears to be exactly the same petition as the one docketed as CA-G.R. No. 67944 which, to repeat, has already been dismissed, without any motion for reconsideration having been filed, so that it cannot be revived as an entirely new petition;</b><br><br>b) <b>Treated as a new petition, the instant petition appears to have been filed out of time,</b> considering that the petitioner received a copy of the assailed Order dated October 24, 2001 on November 7, 2001, so that the last day of the 60-day period within which to file the same expired on January 6, 2002, whereas the instant petition was filed only on February 8, 2002 and, hence, <b>already late by thirty-three (33) days;</b><br><br>c) Moreover, <b>the petitioner did not first file with the respondent court a motion for the reconsideration of the assailed October 24, 2001, which is a condition precedent to the filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>;</b>  and<br><br>d) Lastly, <b>the certificate of non-forum shopping incorporated in the petition at bar is defective in that it does not disclose the earlier filing of a similar petition by herein petitioner Alfredo O. Estrera and Lilia F. Eduarte</b> which was, however, dismissed, thereby violating Section 3, Rule 46 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, in relation to Section 5, Rule 7 of the same Rules.<br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DISMISSED OUTRIGHT, and the petitioner Alfredo O. Estrera and counsel Atty. Rene Artemio T. Pacana are both directed to show cause cause, within fifteen (15) days from notice hereof, why they should not be dealt with for contempt of court for engaging in forum shopping.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner then filed his Manifestation/Explanation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and his Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> both dated March 26, 2002.  He explained that his failure to disclose the previous petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>was through sheer inadvertence or oversight and the belief that since the previous petition had already been dismissed, there is no longer any similar case pending with the court.<br><br>On June 17, 2002, the CA issued the second assailed Resolution, the dispositive portion of which states thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED; and the petitioner Alfredo O. Estrera and counsel, Atty. Rene Artemio T. Pacana, are found guilty of forum shopping and EACH is sentenced to pay a fine of Fifteen Thousand (P15,000.00) Pesos, failing in which, EACH is to suffer imprisonment of three (3) months.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> where petitioner alleges that:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The Honorable Court of Appeals:<br></div><blockquote> A.) FAILED SERIOUSLY TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE CERTIFICATE OF NON-FORUM SHOPPING INCORPORATED TO THE PETITION DOCKETED AS CA-G.R. SP NO. 67944 WAS DEEMED IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 3, PARAGRAPH 3, RULE 46 OF THE 1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.  HENCE, GRAVELY ERRED IN DISMISSING THE PETITION.<br><br>B.) SERIOUSLY FAILED TO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT DISMISSAL OF THE PETITION UNDER SECTION 3, PARAGRAPH 3, RULE 46 OF THE 1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE IN RELATION TO SECTION 5, RULE 7 OF THE SAME RULES SHALL BE UNDERSTOOD TO BE WITHOUT PREJUDICE.<br><br>C.) SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE PETITION DOCKETED AS CA-G.R. SP NO. 69407 WAS A REVIVAL OF THE PETITION DOCKETED AS CA-G.R. SP NO. 67944 WHICH IT EARLIER DISMISSED;<br><br>D.) SERIOUSLY ERRED IN TREATING THE PETITION DOCKETED AS CA-G.R. SP NO. 69407 AS A NEW PETITION AND IN FINDING THAT THE SAME WAS FILED OUT OF TIME;<br><br>E.) SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING HEREIN PETITIONER AND UNDERSIGNED COUNSEL GUILTY OF FORUM SHOPPING AND IMPOSING THE PENALTY OF FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P15,000.00) EACH OR TO SUFFER IMPRISONMENT OF THREE (3) MONTHS IN CASE OF FAILURE THEREOF, WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW;<br><br>F.) SERIOUSLY FAILED TO APPRECIATE AND CONSIDER THE PRESENCE OF EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JUSTIFIED HEREIN PETITIONER IN FILING THE PETITION WITHOUT FILING A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION; AND<br><br>G.) FAILING TO DECIDE THE PETITION ON ITS MERITS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Petitioner must be reminded of the function of the remedy of certiorari.  In <i>People v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court expounded thus:<br><blockquote>As observed in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, et al.</i> "the special civil action for certiorari is a remedy designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment.  The <i>raison d'etre</i> for the rule is <b>when a court exercises its jurisdiction, an error committed while so engaged does not deprive it of the jurisdiction being exercised when the error is committed.</b>  If it did, every error committed by a court would deprive it of its jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment would be a void judgment. In such a scenario, the administration of justice would not survive.  <b>Hence, where the issue or question involved affects the wisdom or legal soundness of the decision â€“ not the jurisdiction of the court to render said decision </b><b>â€“</b><b> the same is beyond the province of a special civil action for certiorari.</b> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As can be gleaned from the afore-quoted assignment of errors in the petition, the issues alleged are only possible errors of judgment, questioning the correctness of the CA's rulings.  Hence, since the issues involved do not affect the jurisdiction of the CA, the writ of <i>certiorari</i> cannot be availed of by petitioner. <br><br>Nevertheless, a close scrutiny of the records reveals that the CA committed no errors.<br><br>Indeed, the CA acted properly in dismissing CA-G.R. No. 67944 as the Section 3, Rule 46 of 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the failure of petitioner to comply with any of the requirements, such as the submission of a sworn certification of non-forum shopping by all the petitioners, is sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition.  Petitioner no longer filed a motion for reconsideration of the Resolution dated January 10, 2002, hence, the same attained finality.<br><br>Although it is true that the dismissal of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in CA-G.R. SP No. 67944 was without prejudice and petitioner could have re-filed such petition, such re-filing should still be done within the prescribed period under Section 4, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, or not later than sixty days from notice of the assailed Order of the RTC.  The CA was correct in ruling that since petitioner received said RTC Order dated October 24, 2001 on November 7, 2001, the last day for filing a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>was on January 6, 2002.  Thus, the filing of the petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 69407 on February 8, 2002 was undoubtedly beyond the 60-day period provided for under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.  On this point alone, CA-G.R. SP No. 69407 was clearly dismissible and should not be given due course.<br><br>It is also too late for petitioner to question the CA Resolution dated January 10, 2002 through the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>. As discussed above, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> should be filed within 60 days from notice of the questioned resolution.  Since petitioner received said CA Resolution on January 22, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the last day for filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to question the same was on March 23, 2002.  The present petition was filed only on July 31, 2002, thus, filed beyond the reglementary period for filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.  This Court, therefore, can no longer entertain any arguments against the propriety of the dismissal of CA-G.R. No. 67944.<br><br>Lastly, the issue of the propriety of finding petitioner guilty of contempt for forum shopping is also not within the province of a special action for <i>certiorari</i>.  As stated in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> issues merely questioning the wisdom or legal soundness of the decision, not the jurisdiction of the court rendering it, are not proper for a petition for <i>certiorari</i>. <br><br>Petitioner's remedy to question the CA's finding of contempt should have been to appeal via a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.  However, pursuant to Section 2, Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, such petition should be filed 15 days after receipt of the CA Resolution dated June 17, 2002.  Petitioner having received said Resolution on June 24, 2002, the last day for filing a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> was on July 9, 2002, but no such petition was filed.<br><br>The axiomatic rule, as stated in <i>Madrigal Transport, Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is that:<br><blockquote>x x x Where appeal is available, certiorari will not prosper, even if the ground therefor is grave abuse of discretion. <b>Basic is the rule that certiorari is not a substitute for the lapsed remedy of appeal.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, since appeal was available to petitioner, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i> cannot be granted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Callejo, Sr., </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Issued by the Fifteenth Division of the Court of Appeals with Associate Justice Mercedes Gozo-Dadole as ponente and concurred in by Associate Justices Salvador J.
