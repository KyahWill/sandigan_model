Aliz) Diaz never left Barcelona, Sorsogon, after her separation from Clemente Bailon x x x.<br><br>As the declaration of presumptive death was extracted by the deceased member using artifice and by exerting fraud upon the unsuspecting court of law, x x x it never had the effect of giving the deceased member the right to marry anew. &nbsp;x x x [I]t is clear that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">marriage to the petitioner is void, considering that the first marriage on April 25, 1955 to Alice Diaz was not previously annulled, invalidated or otherwise dissolved </span>during the lifetime of the parties thereto.&nbsp; x x x as determined through the investigation conducted by the SSS, Clemente Bailon was the abandoning spouse, not Alice Diaz Bailon.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It having been established, by substantial evidence, that the petitioner was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just a common-law wife</span> of the deceased member, it necessarily follows that she is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not entitled as a primary beneficiary</span>, to the latter's death benefit. &nbsp;x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It having been determined that Teresita Jarque was not the legitimate surviving spouse and primary beneficiary of Clemente Bailon, it behooves her to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refund the total amount of death benefit she received</span> from the SSS for the period from February 1998 until May 1999 pursuant to the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;

text-decoration: underline;">33]</sup> &nbsp;(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Respondent's Motion for Reconsideration <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> having been denied by Order of June 4, 2003, she filed a petition for review <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> before the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>By Decision of June 23, 2004, the CA reversed and set aside the April 2, 2003 Resolution and June 4, 2003 Order of the SSC and thus ordered the SSS to pay respondent all the pension benefits due her.&nbsp; Held the CA:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he paramount concern in this case transcends the issue of whether or not the decision of the then CFI, now RTC, declaring Alice Diaz presumptively dead has attained finality but, more importantly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether or not the respondents SSS and Commission can validly re-evaluate the findings of the RTC, and on its own, declare the latter's decision to be bereft of any basis.</span>&nbsp; On similar import, can respondents SSS and Commission validly declare the first marriage subsisting and the second marriage null and void?<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x while it is true that a judgment declaring a person presumptively dead never attains finality as the finding that "the person is unheard of in seven years is merely a presumption <span style="font-style: italic;">juris tantum,</span>" the second marriage contracted by a person with an absent spouse endures until annulled.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is only the competent court that can nullify the second marriage</span> pursuant to Article 87 of the Civil Code and upon the reappearance of the missing spouse, which action for annulment may be filed.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nowhere does the law contemplates [sic] the possibility that respondent SSS may validly declare the second marriage null and void on the basis alone of its own investigation and declare that the decision of the RTC declaring one to be presumptively dead is without basis.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Respondent SSS cannot arrogate upon itself the authority to review the decision of the regular courts</span> under the pretext of determining the actual and lawful beneficiaries of its members.&nbsp; Notwithstanding its opinion as to the soundness of the findings of the RTC, it should extend due credence to the decision of the RTC absent of [sic] any judicial pronouncement to the contrary. &nbsp;x x x<br><br>x x x [A]ssuming <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that respondent SSS actually possesses the authority to declare the decision of the RTC to be without basis, the procedure it followed was offensive to the principle of fair play and thus its findings are of doubtful quality considering that petitioner Teresita was not given ample opportunity to present evidence for and her behalf.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Respondent SSS is correct in stating that the filing of an Affidavit of Reappearance with the Civil Registry is no longer practical under the premises.&nbsp; Indeed, there is no more first marriage to restore as the marital bond between Alice Diaz and Clemente Bailon was already terminated upon the latter's death.&nbsp; Neither is there a second marriage to terminate because the second marriage was likewise dissolved by the death of Clemente Bailon.<br><br>However, it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not correct to conclude that simply because the filing of the Affidavit of Reappearance with the Civil Registry where parties to the subsequent marriage reside is already inutile, the respondent SSS has now the authority to review the decision of the RTC and consequently declare the second marriage null and void</span>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The SSC and the SSS separately filed their Motions for Reconsideration <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> which were both denied for lack of merit.<br><br>Hence, the SSS' present petition for review on certiorari <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> anchored on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE DECISION OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS IS CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>The SSS faults the CA for failing to give due consideration to the findings of facts of the SSC on the prior and subsisting marriage between Bailon and Alice; &nbsp;in disregarding the authority of the SSC to determine to whom, between Alice and respondent, the death benefits should be awarded pursuant to Section 5 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the Social Security Law; and in declaring that the SSS did not give respondent due process or ample opportunity to present evidence in her behalf.<br><br>The SSS submits that "the observations and findings relative to the CFI proceedings are of no moment to the present controversy, as the same may be considered only as <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter dicta</span> in view of the SSC's finding of the existence of a prior and subsisting marriage between Bailon and Alice by virtue of which Alice has a better right to the death benefits." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>That the SSC is empowered to settle any dispute with respect to SSS coverage, benefits and contributions, there is no doubt.&nbsp; In so exercising such power, however, it cannot review, much less reverse, decisions rendered by courts of law as it did in the case at bar when it declared that the December 10, 1970 CFI Order was obtained through fraud and subsequently disregarded the same, making its own findings with respect to the validity of Bailon and Alice's marriage on the one hand and the invalidity of Bailon and respondent's marriage on the other.<br><br>In interfering with and passing upon the CFI Order, the SSC virtually acted as an appellate court.&nbsp; The law does not give the SSC unfettered discretion to trifle with orders of regular courts in the exercise of its authority to determine the beneficiaries of the SSS.<br><br>The two marriages involved herein having been solemnized prior to the effectivity on August 3, 1988 of the Family Code, the applicable law to determine their validity is the Civil Code which was the law in effect at the time of their celebration. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Article 83 of the Civil Code <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 83. Any marriage subsequently contracted by any person during the lifetime of the first spouse of such person with any person other than such first spouse shall be illegal and void from its performance, unless:<br><br>(1) The first marriage was annulled or dissolved; or<br><br>(2) The first spouse had been absent for seven consecutive years at the time of the second marriage without the spouse present having news of the absentee being alive, or if the absentee, though he has been absent for less than seven years, is generally considered as dead and believed to be so by the spouse present at the time of contracting such subsequent marriage, or if the absentee is presumed dead according to Articles 390 and 391.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The <span style="font-weight: bold;">marriage so contracted shall be valid</span> in any of the three cases until declared null and void by a competent court.</span> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Under the foregoing provision of the Civil Code, a subsequent marriage contracted during the lifetime of the first spouse is illegal and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> unless the prior marriage is first annulled or dissolved or contracted under any of the three exceptional circumstances.&nbsp; It bears noting that the marriage under any of these exceptional cases is deemed valid "until declared null and void by a competent court."&nbsp; It follows that the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus probandi</span> in these cases rests on the party assailing the second marriage. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, as found by the CFI, Alice had been absent for 15 consecutive years <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> when Bailon sought the declaration of her presumptive death, which judicial declaration was not even a requirement then for purposes of remarriage. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Eminent jurist Arturo M. Tolentino (now deceased) commented:<blockquote>Where a person has entered into two successive marriages, a presumption arises in favor of the validity of the second marriage, and the burden is on the party attacking the validity of the second marriage to prove that the first marriage had not been dissolved; it is not enough to prove the first marriage, for it must also be shown that it had not ended when the second marriage was contracted.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The presumption in favor</span> of the innocence of the defendant from crime or wrong and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of the legality of his second marriage, will prevail over the presumption of the continuance of life of the first spouse or of the continuance of the marital relation with such first spouse.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Civil Code,</span> a subsequent marriage being voidable, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> it is terminated by final judgment of annulment in a case instituted by the absent spouse who reappears or by either of the spouses in the subsequent marriage.<br><br>Under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Family Code,</span> no judicial proceeding to annul a subsequent marriage is necessary.&nbsp; Thus Article 42 thereof provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 42. The subsequent marriage referred to in the preceding Article shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">automatically terminated by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">recording of the affidavit of reappearance</span> of the absent spouse</span>, unless there is a judgment annulling the previous marriage or declaring it void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sworn statement of the fact and circumstances of reappearance shall be recorded in the civil registry of the residence of the parties to the subsequent marriage at the instance of any interested person, <span style="font-weight: bold;">with due notice to the spouses of the subsequent marriage</span></span> and without prejudice to the fact of reappearance being judicially determined in case such fact is disputed. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The termination of the subsequent marriage by affidavit provided by the above-quoted provision of the Family Code does not preclude the filing of an action in court to prove the reappearance of the absentee and obtain a declaration of dissolution or termination of the subsequent marriage. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>If the absentee reappears, but no step is taken to terminate the subsequent marriage, either by affidavit or by court action, such <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absentee's mere reappearance, even if made known to the spouses in the subsequent marriage, will not terminate such marriage.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; Since the second marriage has been contracted because of a presumption that the former spouse is dead, such presumption continues inspite of the spouse's physical reappearance, and by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fiction of law, he or she must still be regarded as legally an absentee until the subsequent marriage is terminated as provided by law.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>If the subsequent marriage is not terminated by registration of an affidavit of reappearance or by judicial declaration but by <span style="font-weight: bold;">death of either spouse</span> as in the case at bar, Tolentino submits:<br><blockquote>x x x [G]enerally if a subsequent marriage is dissolved by the death of either spouse, the effects of dissolution of valid marriages shall arise.&nbsp; The good or bad faith of either spouse can no longer be raised, because, as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in annullable or voidable marriages, the marriage cannot be questioned except in a direct action for annulment.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Similarly,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Lapuz v.
