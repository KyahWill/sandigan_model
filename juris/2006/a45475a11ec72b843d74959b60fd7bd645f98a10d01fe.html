CV No. 33731, which affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> the Decision dated November 28, 1990 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 7 (Baguio City), La Trinidad, Benguet; and the CA Resolution dated December 15, 2000 which denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The petition originated from an action for recovery of possession of the eastern half of a parcel of land situated in Residence Section "J", Camp Seven, Baguio City, consisting of 101,006 square meters, more or less, and identified as Lot 46, Ts-39, Plan SWO-37115.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The antecedent facts are clear:<br><br>The subject land, at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, had been part of the land claim of Mateo Cariño.&nbsp; Within this site, a sawmill and other buildings had been constructed by H.C. Heald in connection with his lumber business.&nbsp; On March 14, 1916, H.C. Heald sold the buildings to Sioco Cariño, son of Mateo Cariño and grandfather of private respondent Jose Cariño.&nbsp; Sioco Cariño then took possession of the buildings and the land on which the buildings were situated. <br><br>Ting-el Dicman,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, namely, Ernesto Dicman, Paul Dicman, Florence Dicman, Babing Cosil, Feliciano Torres, Cristina Alawas, Emily Torres and Tomasito Torres, and resident of Atab, a sitio within the City of Baguio but located at some distance from the land in controversy, had been employed by Sioco Cariño as his cattle herder.&nbsp; On the advice of his lawyers, and because there were already many parcels of land recorded in his name,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Sioco Cariño caused the survey of the land in controversy in the name of Ting-el Dicman.<br><br>On October 22, 1928, Ting-el Dicman executed a public instrument entitled "Deed of Conveyance of Part Rights and Interests in Agricultural Land" with Sioco Cariño.&nbsp; The deed reads:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">DEED OF CONVEYANCE OF PART RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN AGRICULTURAL LAND.<br></div><br>KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS:<br><br>That I, Ting-el Diac-man, of legal age, widower, and resident of the sitio known as "Atab", near Camp Seven, City of Baguio, Philippine Islands, DO HEREBY STATE, viz:-<br><br>That I am the applicant for a free-patent of a parcel of land (public), having a surface of over ten (10) hectares, surveyed by the District Land Office of Baguio for me, and located in the place known as Camp Seven, Baguio;<br><br>That to-date I have not as yet received the plan for said survey;<br><br>That Mr. Sioco Cariño has advanced all expenses for said survey for me and in my name, and also all other expenses for the improvement of said land, to date;<br><br>That for and in consideration of said advance expenses, to me made and delivered by said Mr. Sioco Cariño, I hereby pledge and promise to convey, deliver and transfer unto said Sioco Cariño, of legal age, married to Guilata Acop, and resident of Baguio, P.I., his heirs and assigns, one half (1/2) of my title, rights, and interest to and in the aforesaid parcel of land; same to be delivered, conveyed and transferred in a final form, according to law, to him, his heirs and assigns, by me, my heirs, and assigns, as soon as title for the same is issued to me by proper authorities.<br><br>That this conveyance, transfer, or assignment, notwithstanding its temporary nature, shall have legal force and effect; once it is approved by the approving authorities all the final papers and documents, this instrument shall be considered superseded.<br><br>After I have received my title to said parcel of land I bind myself, my heirs and assigns, to execute the final papers and forward same for approval of the competent authorities at Mr. Sioco Cariño's expense.<br><br>WITNESS MY HAND in the City of Baguio, P.I., this, the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of October, 1928, A.D.<br><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center; margin-left: 160px;">his right<br>TING-EL &nbsp;DIAC-MAN<br>thumbmark<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></div><br>After the execution of the foregoing deed, Sioco Cariño, who had been in possession of the land in controversy since 1916, continued to stay thereon. <br><br>On January 10, 1938, Sioco Cariño executed, as seller, a public instrument entitled "Deed of Absolute Sale" covering the subject land and its improvements with his son, Guzman Cariño, as buyer.&nbsp; The contract states in part:<br><blockquote>x x x for and in consideration of the sum of ONE PESO (P 1.00) Philippine Currency and other valuable considerations which I had received from my son, Guzman A.

Tomas, La Union, to take possession of the subject land and building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Guzman Cariño moved to Baguio as requested and occupied the property.&nbsp; Evidence was adduced in the RTC to the effect that Guzman Cariño took possession of the property publicly, peacefully, and in the concept of owner: the directory of Baguio Telephones published in October 1940 lists the residence of Guzman A. Cariño at Camp 7, Baguio City, along with his telephone number; pictures were taken of him and his family, including the private respondent who was then an infant, depicting the property in the background; U.S. Army authorities obtained permission from Guzman Cariño to use a part of the land in question after the war; he introduced various improvements on the property over the years and exercised acts of ownership over them; he permitted the use of portions of the land to Governor Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr. and the Boy Scouts of Rizal Province; he leased out portions of the land to Bayani Pictures, Inc.; and his neighbors confirmed the possession and occupation over the property of Guzman Cariño and, after him, his son, herein private respondent Jose Cariño.&nbsp; These findings of fact were either confirmed or uncontroverted by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On July 27, 1954, Guzman Cariño had the entire Lot 46 resurveyed so as to indicate the half portion that belonged to him and the other half that belonged to the petitioners.&nbsp; The resurvey evenly divided the lot into Lot 76-A and 76-B, and purportedly indicated that Lot 76-A, consisting of 50,953 square meters, belonged to the petitioners, while Lot 76-B, also consisting of 50,953 square meters, formerly pertained to Sioco Cariño and, later, to Guzman Cariño.&nbsp; Additionally, the resurvey indicated the house where private respondent Jose Cariño resided and, before him, where his predecessors-in-interest, Sioco and Guzman Cariño, also resided.<br><br>On May 23, 1955, Guzman Cariño filed a Free Patent Application over the land in question. The application was given due course, but Guzman later withdrew it when he decided to file his opposition to the petition later filed by the heirs of Ting-el Dicman. This petition, entitled "Petition of the Heirs of Dicman to Reopen Civil Reservation Case No. 1, G.L.R.O. 211," was filed by Felipe Dicman, Bobing Dicman and Cating Dicman, in their capacity as compulsory heirs of Ting-el Dicman on April 24, 1959 with the Court of First Instance of Baguio.&nbsp; The petition sought to establish ownership over Lot 76-A and Lot 76-B which, taken together, covered an area of 10.1006 hectares.&nbsp; Guzman Cariño opposed the petition insofar as he insisted ownership over Lot 76-B, the land in controversy.&nbsp; The Estate of Sioco Cariño likewise filed an opposition. <br><br>On March 6, 1963, the trial court rendered a partial judgment and confirmed that the title over Lot 76-A belonged to the heirs of Ting-el Dicman, there having been no adverse claim.&nbsp; But as to Lot 76-B, the trial court found it necessary to hold further hearing in order to decide on the adverse claims of the parties.<br><br>Meanwhile, on January 8, 1960, while the foregoing petition was pending in the trial court, President Carlos P. Garcia issued Proclamation No. 628 "excluding from the operation of the Baguio Townsite Reservation certain parcels of public land known as 'Igorot Claims' situated in the City of Baguio and declaring the same open to disposition under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Public Land Act."&nbsp; The Proclamation further provided that the "Igorot Claims" enumerated therein shall be "subject to the condition that except in favor of the government or any of its branches, units, or institutions, lands acquired by virtue of this proclamation shall not be encumbered or alienated within a period of fifteen years from and after the date of issuance of patent."&nbsp; One such claim pertained to the "Heirs of Dicman," to wit:<br><blockquote><br><table style="width: 525px; height: 71px;"><tbody><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Name</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">Lot No.</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">Survey Plan</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">Residence Section</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">Area (Sq. m.)<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Heirs of<br><div>Dicman</div></td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">46</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">Swo-37115</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">"J"</td><td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;">101,006</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br>Before the trial court could dispose of the case, the Supreme Court promulgated <span style="font-style: italic;">Republic v. Marcos</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which held that Courts of First Instance of Baguio have no jurisdiction to reopen judicial proceedings on the basis of Republic Act No. 931.&nbsp; As a consequence, on July 28, 1978, the trial court dismissed the petition to reopen Civil Reservation Case No. 1, G.L.R.O. 211 insofar as Lot 76-B was concerned, and the certificate of title issued pursuant to the partial decision involving Lot 76-A was invalidated.&nbsp; The trial court stated that the remedy for those who were issued titles was to file a petition for revalidation under Presidential Decree No. 1271, as amended by Presidential Decrees No. 1311 and 2034.<br><br>After the dismissal of the case, Guzman Cariño was left undisturbed in his possession of the subject property until his death on August 19, 1982.&nbsp; His remains are buried on the land in question, next to the large house purchased in 1916 by his father, Sioco Cariño (the grandfather of private respondent), from H.C. Heald. &nbsp;Guzman's widow and son, private respondent Jose Sioco C. Cariño, continued possession of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On April 20, 1983, petitioners, suing as compulsory heirs of Ting-el Dicman, revived the foregoing case by filing a complaint for recovery of possession with damages involving the subject property with the RTC, docketed as Civil Case No. 59-R.&nbsp; As earlier stated, petitioners, then complainants, originally sought to recover possession of the eastern half of the parcel of land situated in Residence Section "J", Camp Seven, Baguio City, consisting of 101,006 square meters, more or less, and identified as Lot 46, Ts-39, Plan SWO-37115.<br><br>Petitioners, then plaintiffs, averred in their complaint:<br><blockquote><ol start="10"><li> That however, this Honorable Court was not able to decide the [&nbsp; ] petition for reopening as far as the remaining eastern half portion of the above-described property is concerned due to the fact that the said petition was dismissed for alleged lack of jurisdiction; x x x<br><br></li><li> That because of the above-mentioned dismissal, the conflict between herein plaintiffs and defendant over the half eastern portion of the above-described property which was one of the issues supposed to be decided in the said judicial reopening case remains undecided;<br><br></li><li> That after the dismissal of the abovementioned petition and before the dispute between herein plaintiffs and defendant over the eastern half portion of the above-described property, defendant unlawfully and illegally continue to occupy portion [sic] of the above-described property to the clear damage and prejudice of herein plaintiffs;<br><br></li><li> That the defendant has no valid claim of ownership and possession over any of the portions of the above-described property;<br><br></li><li> That plaintiffs and their predecessors-in-interest have been religiously paying the realty taxes covering the above-described property x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Private respondent Jose Cariño filed his answer and prayed for dismissal.&nbsp; He alleged that his predecessors-in-interest had acquired the land by onerous title through the "Deed of Absolute Sale" dated January 10, 1938 executed by his grandfather, Sioco Cariño, as seller, and his father, Guzman Cariño, as buyer; that the property was earlier acquired by Sioco Cariño by virtue of the "Deed of Conveyance of Part Rights and Interests in Agricultural Land" dated October 22, 1928 executed between Sioco Cariño and Ting-el Dicman; and that he has been in possession of the subject property for 55 years peacefully, in good faith, and in concept of owner and therefore perfected title over the same through acquisitive prescription.<br><br>On June 13, 1983, the administratrix of the Estate of Sioco Cariño filed a motion to intervene with the RTC.&nbsp; On July 1, 1983, the RTC granted said motion.&nbsp; On July 11, 1983, the Estate of Sioco Cariño filed its Complaint-in-Intervention, praying for quieting of title among the adverse claimants.<br><br>The RTC, through an ocular inspection on February 15, 1984, found that the larger building still stands on the land in controversy and, together with the surrounding area, constituted the residence and was in the possession of private respondent and his family.<br><br>On November 28, 1990, the RTC rendered its decision in favor of private respondent, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol><li>Plaintiffs' complaint is hereby DISMISSED;<br><br></li><li>Plaintiffs'-Intervenors complaint-in-intervention is hereby dismissed;<br><br></li><li>Defendant is hereby declared the lawful possessor and as the party who has the better right over the land subject matter [sic] of this action and as such he may apply for the confirmation of his title thereto in accordance with law (R.A.

Dicman, son of petitioner Ernesto Dicman, had been appointed by the petitioners to sign the petition for and in their behalf, but due to distance and time constraints between Makati City and Baguio, he was not able to submit the same in time for the deadline for the petition on February 12, 2001.&nbsp; Petitioners attached the Special Power of Attorney seeking to formalize the appointment of Julio F. Dicman as their attorney-in-fact and to ratify his execution of the verification and certification of non-forum shopping for and on behalf of the petitioners.<br><br>On March 15, 2001, private respondent filed with this Court a Motion for Leave of Court to File Motion to Dismiss and/or Deny Due Course, arguing that the petition failed to comply with the requirements for verification and certification of non-forum shopping.&nbsp; The affiant of the petition, according to private respondent, is not a principal party in the case; rather, he is merely the son of Ernesto Dicman, one of the petitioners.&nbsp; The verification and certification reads:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">VERIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION<br></div><br>I, <span style="font-weight: bold;">JULIO F. DICMAN</span>, of legal age, Filipino, with residence address at Camp 7, Montecillo Road, Baguio City, after being first duly sworn in accordance with law, do hereby depose and state:<br><br>1.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">I am one of the petitioners</span> in the above-entitled case;<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To private respondent, since Ernesto Dicman, one of the petitioners, appears to be alive, he excludes his son as the successor-in-interest of Ting-el Dicman.&nbsp; The verification, therefore, is false in view of the statement under oath that Julio F. Dicman is a petitioner when in fact he is not, and should be cause for the dismissal of the case and indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to administrative and criminal action.<br><br>On May 2, 2001, in their Manifestation and Motion for Leave to File the Attached Reply and Reply, petitioners argued that while it may be true that the verification and certification to the petition were signed by Julio F. Dicman, the son of one of the petitioners, they subsequently confirmed his authority to sign on behalf of all the petitioners through the Special Power of Attorney submitted to the Court in a Manifestation and Motion to Substitute Babing Cosil and Cristina Alawas With Their Respective Heirs filed on March 2, 2001.&nbsp; Petitioners invoked substantial compliance and prayed that the Court overlook the procedural lapse in the interest of substantial justice.&nbsp; The parties thereafter submitted their respective memoranda.<br><br>The petition must be dismissed on the following grounds:<br><br>1. &nbsp;Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires the pleader to submit a certificate of non-forum shopping to be executed by the plaintiff or principal party, is mandatory, and non-compliance therewith is a sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> &nbsp;The forum shopping certification must be signed by the party himself as he has personal knowledge of the facts therein stated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, it is the plaintiff or principal party who is in the best position to know whether he actually filed or caused the filing of a petition in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; Where there are two or more plaintiffs or petitioners, all of them must sign the verification and non-forum certification, and the signature of only one of them is insufficient,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> unless the one who signs the verification and certification has been authorized to execute the same by, and on behalf of, the co-plaintiff or co-petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; But it must be stressed that the requirement the principal party himself should sign the certification applies only to a natural person and not to a juridical person which can only act through its officer or duly authorized agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>However, the Court has also held that the rules on forum shopping were designed to promote and facilitate the orderly administration of justice and thus should not be interpreted with such absolute literalness as to subvert its own ultimate and legitimate objective. The rule of substantial compliance may be availed of with respect to the contents of the certification.&nbsp; This is because the requirement of strict compliance with the provisions regarding the certification of non-forum shopping merely underscores its mandatory nature in that the certification cannot be altogether dispensed with or its requirements completely disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> &nbsp;Thus, under justifiable circumstances, the Court has relaxed the rule requiring the submission of such certification considering that although it is obligatory, it is not jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>But a perusal of the relevant decisions handed down by this Court consistently shows that substantial compliance may be invoked and the procedural lapse overlooked provided that, where the petitioner is a natural person as in the case at bar, the authorized signatory must also be a principal party or co-petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Petitioners, as natural persons, cannot therefore appoint a non-party to sign for them, especially since only the petitioners occupy the best position to know whether they actually filed or caused the filing of a petition in this case and who personally know the facts stated in the petition.&nbsp; On this point alone the petition should be dismissed.<br><br>2.&nbsp; It is a settled rule that in the exercise of the Supreme Court's power of review, the Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake the re-examination of the evidence presented by the contending parties during the trial of the case considering that the findings of facts of the CA are conclusive and binding on the Court.&nbsp; While jurisprudence has recognized several exceptions in which factual issues may be resolved by this Court, namely: (1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting;

Petitioners argue on appeal that the "Deed of Conveyance of Part Rights and Interests in Agricultural Land" dated October 22, 1928 executed between Sioco Cariño and Ting-el Dicman is void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> for lack of approval of competent authorities as required under Section 145 in relation to Section 146 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu, the application of which was later extended to the Mountain Province and Nueva Viscaya and, thereafter, throughout the entire national territory;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that the sale was without valid consideration; and that the said deed is not an absolute sale but merely a contract to sell subject to the suspensive condition that the papers evidencing the title must first be perfected.&nbsp; These arguments were lumped under the following issue in their appeal to the CA:<br><ol start="2"><blockquote><li>THE HONORABLE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING THE DEED OF CONVEYANCE [OF] PART RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN AGRICULTURAL LAND EXECUTED BY DICMAN IN FAVOR OF SIOCO CARIÑO DESPITE ITS NULLITY. <br></li></blockquote></ol>The foregoing issue and the incidents thereunder were never raised by the petitioners during the proceedings before the RTC.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that issues raised for the first time on appeal and not raised timely in the proceedings in the lower court are barred by estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Matters, theories or arguments not brought out in the original proceedings cannot be considered on review or appeal where they are raised for the first time. &nbsp;To consider the alleged facts and arguments raised belatedly would amount to trampling on the basic principles of fair play, justice and due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>4.&nbsp; Even if this Court should declare the sale null and void or the agreement merely a contract to sell subject to a suspensive condition that has yet to occur, private respondent nonetheless acquired ownership over the land in question through acquisitive prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The records show that as early as 1938, the land in controversy had been in the possession of Guzman Cariño, predecessor-in-interest of private respondent, continuously, publicly, peacefully, in concept of owner, and in good faith with just title, to the exclusion of the petitioners and their predecessors-in-interest, well beyond the period required under law to acquire title by acquisitive prescription which, in this case, is 10 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> &nbsp;The findings of fact of the lower courts, and which this Court has no reason to disturb, inescapably point to this conclusion: immediately after the "Deed of Absolute Sale," a public instrument dated January 10, 1938, had been executed by Sioco Cariño in favor of his son, Guzman Cariño (the father of private respondent), the latter immediately occupied the property; the 1940 directory of Baguio Telephones lists his residence at Camp 7, Baguio City along with his telephone number; his permitting the use of portions of the property to various third parties; his introduction of improvements over the land in controversy; the testimonial accounts of his neighbors; and that it was Guzman Cariño alone who declared for tax purposes both the land and the improvements thereon in his name, while the tax declarations of the other claimants made no reference to the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Although arguably Sioco Cariño may not have been the owner of the subject property when he executed the "Deed of Absolute Sale" in 1938 in favor of his son, the requirement of just title is nonetheless satisfied, which means that the mode of transferring ownership should ordinarily have been valid and true, had the grantor been the owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; By the time the successors-in-interest of Ting-el Dicman sought to establish ownership over the land in controversy by filing their "Petition of the Heirs of Dicman to Reopen Civil Reservation Case No. 1, G.L.R.O. 211" on April 24, 1959 with the trial court, and which Guzman timely opposed, more than 20 years had already elapsed.&nbsp; Thus, the 10-year period for acquisitive prescription is deemed satisfied well before Guzman's possession can be said to be civilly interrupted by the filing of the foregoing petition to reopen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; After the dismissal of that case on July 28, 1978, Guzman Cariño was left undisturbed in his possession of the subject property until his death on August 19, 1982.&nbsp; His remains are buried on the land in question.&nbsp; Thereafter, Guzman's widow and son, herein private respondent, continued possession of the subject property in the same manner.&nbsp; When petitioners, heirs of Ting-el Dicman, tried to revive the case on April 20, 1983, they had, far before that time, lost all rights to recover possession or ownership.<br><br>5.&nbsp; Prescinding from the issue on prescription, the petitioners and their predecessors-in-interest are nonetheless guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Laches</span> has been defined as such neglect or omission to assert a right, taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other circumstances causing prejudice to an adverse party, as will operate as a bar in equity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; It is a delay in the assertion of a right which works disadvantage to another<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> because of the inequity founded on some change in the condition or relations of the property or parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; It is based on public policy which, for the peace of society,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> ordains that relief will be denied to a stale demand which otherwise could be a valid claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>&nbsp; It is different from and applies independently of prescription.&nbsp; While prescription is concerned with the fact of delay, <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span> is concerned with the effect of delay.&nbsp; Prescription is a matter of time; <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span> is principally a question of inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced, this inequity being founded on some change in the condition of the property or the relation of the parties.&nbsp; Prescription is statutory; <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span> is not.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Laches</span> applies in equity, whereas prescription applies at law.&nbsp; Prescription is based on a fixed time, <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span> is not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Laches</span> means the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting the presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; It has been held that even a registered owner of property under the Torrens Title system may be barred from recovering possession of property by virtue of <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]<br><br></sup>Given the foregoing findings of fact, all the four (4) elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span>, as prescribed by the decisions of this Court, are present in the case, to wit:<br><ol type="a"><li>Conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made and for which the complaint seeks a remedy;<br><br></li><li>Delay in asserting the complainant's rights, the complainant having had knowledge or notice, of the defendant's conduct and having been afforded an opportunity to institute a suit;<br><br></li><li>Lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the complainant would assert the right on which he bases his suit; and<br><br></li><li>Injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant, or the suit is not held to be barred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></li></ol>As correctly held by the RTC, there is no evidence to the effect that Ting-el Dicman or his successors-in-interest ever filed any action to question the validity of the "Deed of Conveyance of Part Rights and Interests in Agricultural Land" after its execution on October 22, 1928<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> despite having every opportunity to do so.&nbsp; Nor was any action to recover possession of the property from Guzman Cariño instituted anytime prior to April 24, 1959, a time when the period for acquisitive prescription, reckoned from Guzman's occupation of the property in 1938, had already transpired in his favor.&nbsp; No evidence likewise appears on the record that Sioco Cariño or his Estate ever filed any action to contest the validity of the "Deed of Absolute Sale" dated January 10, 1938.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though counsel for the Estate of Sioco Cariño tried to assail the deed as a forgery in the trial court, the attempt failed and no appeal was lodged therefrom.&nbsp; It will be difficult for this Court to assume that the petitioners and their predecessors were all the while ignorant of the adverse possession of private respondent and his predecessors given the publicity of their conduct and the nature of their acts.&nbsp; Private respondent and his predecessors-in-interest were made to feel secure in the belief that no action would be filed against them by such passivity.&nbsp; There is no justifiable reason for petitioners' delay in asserting their rights-the facts in their entirety show that they have slept on them.&nbsp; For over 30 years reckoned from the "Deed of Conveyance of Part Rights and Interests in Agricultural Land" dated October 22, 1928, or 20 years reckoned from the "Deed of Absolute Sale" dated January 10, 1938, they neglected to take positive steps to assert their dominical claim over the property.&nbsp; With the exception of forgery, all other issues concerning the validity of the two instruments abovementioned, as well as the averment that the former was in the nature of a contract to sell, were issues raised only for the first time on appeal and cannot therefore be taken up at this late a stage.&nbsp; The features of this case are not new.&nbsp; The Court has on several occasions held in particular that despite the judicial pronouncement that the sale of real property by illiterate ethnic minorities is null and void for lack of approval of competent authorities, the right to recover possession has nonetheless been barred through the operation of the equitable doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">laches</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>6.&nbsp; Petitioners argue that Proclamation No. 628 issued by then President Carlos P.
