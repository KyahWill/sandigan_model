SP No. 84835 dated 22 July 2004 dismissing petitioner Eastland Construction &amp; Development Corporation's petition for review for failure to append material portions of the record and other supporting papers as well as the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping, and the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 11 October 2004 denying its motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The antecedents are stated in the decision of the Housing and Land Use Arbiter, as follows:<br><blockquote>Sometime in 1996, respondent Eastland Construction and Development Corporation (Eastland for brevity), publicly announced and claimed that they would sell and develop a subdivision in Mabini, Batangas, to be known as the "Evergreen Anilao Estate," covered by TCT No. T-82217.&nbsp; For this purpose, Eastland went on a marketing campaign where they represented to the people of Mabini, Batangas the availability of the Project in general and of specific lots in particular.&nbsp; Allegedly at that time, Eastland was not yet equipped with a Certificate of Registration and License to Sell (CR/LS) issued by this Office.<br><br>Believing on the representations made by Eastland, complainant entered into a contract with the Eastland through its president Imelda de los Santos to purchase a lot specifically described as Lot No. 9, Block 2 with a total area of 125 square meters for a contract price of P168,750.00.&nbsp; Complainant alleged that there was a technical error in the contract to sell because the area stated therein is 120 square meters corresponding the amount of P162,000.00.&nbsp; Thus, complainant paid an additional amount of P6,750.00 corresponding the additional 5 square meter lot to complete the 125 square meter lot, which is allegedly the true and genuine agreement of the parties.<br><br>The parties likewise agreed that upon full payment of the purchase price, Eastland is obliged to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of the complainant, free from any liens and encumbrances, to wit:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"4.&nbsp; DEED OF SALE. Upon complete payment by the PURCHASER of all obligation herein stipulated, the OWNER agrees to execute a final deed of sale in favor of the PURCHASER free from liens and encumbrances whatsoever except those imposed herein and by law."&nbsp; (Italics Supplied)</span></blockquote>Listed below are the payments made by the complainant for the subject lot to wit:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" height="83" width="356"><tbody><tr><td>(Receipt lost)</td><td style="text-align: right;"> P5,000.00 </td><td style="text-align: right;"> Reservation</td></tr><tr><td>May 17, 1996</td><td style="text-align: right;">48,600.00</td><td style="text-align: right;">O.R.

De los Santos, and Arturo M. Garcia, and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) as respondents.<br><br>In a decision dated 21 November 2002, Atty. Raymundo A. Foronda, Housing and Land Use Arbiter, disposed of the case as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Declaring as null and void the Real Estate Mortgage constituted over Lot 9, Block 2 of the Evergreen Anilao Estate located in Mabini, Batangas, entered into between Eastland Construction and Development Corporation and Orient Commercial Banking Corporation;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondents to jointly and severally, execute and deliver to complainant the Deed of Absolute Sale over the aforecited property;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondents to jointly and severally, deliver the Transfer Certificate of Title covering the subject lot, free from liens and encumbrances, within fifteen (15) days from finality of the Decision;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondents to jointly and severally turn over to the complainant peacefully the possession of the subject lot;<br><br></li><li>Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay complainant the following:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>the sum of P20,000.00 as moral damages;<br></li><li>the sum of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br></li><li>the sum of P20,000.00 as attorney's fees and cost of suit;<br></li></ol><br></li><li>Ordering respondents to jointly and severally pay this Board the sum of P40,000.00 for violation of Sections 4, 5, 18 &amp; 25 of P.D. 957 and the provision of B.P. 220 for selling beyond the maximum selling price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The Housing and Land Use Arbiter ruled that respondent's full payment of the contract price appearing in the Contract to Sell justifies the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale, the transfer in the latter's name of the title covering the subject property, free from liens and encumbrances, and its eventual turnover of the physical possession to her.&nbsp; He brushed aside Eastland's defense that it could not execute a Deed of Absolute Sale and/ or deliver the title in respondent's name because the subject lot, together with other lots in the same subdivision, was mortgaged to Orient Commercial Banking Corporation (Orient Bank).&nbsp; He explained that Eastland, as developer/owner of the project, was obligated to guarantee that the lots it is offering for sale were free from liens and encumbrances.&nbsp; He said that under Presidential Decree No. 957, the seller, if the buyer had already made full payment of the lot or unit, had six months from the time of the issuance of the title to the buyer within which to redeem the title.&nbsp; He disclosed that Eastland's attempt to deny the existence of a mortgage over the titles of the lots being sold claiming that same were merely pledged was debunked by PDIC's admission that the titles were indeed mortgaged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, he held that Eastland concealed from its buyers the fact of mortgage by not showing a copy of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-82217 and in refusing to hand over copies of titles over the subdivided lots.&nbsp; He added that Eastland's failure to inform respondent of the mortgage likewise bespeaks of concealment because under Section 18 of Presidential Decree No. 957, the latter has the option to pay the installment for the lot or unit directly to the mortgagee who shall apply the payments to the corresponding mortgage indebtedness secured by the particular lot or unit being paid for to enable said buyer to obtain title over the lot or unit promptly after full payment.&nbsp; This concealment, he ruled, constitutes fraud and unsound real estate business practice.&nbsp; Moreover, he declared that Eastland should also be liable for its pre-selling activities inasmuch as the subject lot was sold to respondent approximately two years before the License to Sell for the subdivision project was issued by the HLURB on 15 September 1998.<br><br>As regards the defenses raised by PDIC, the Housing and Land Use Arbiter ignored them stating that since the mortgagee bank had at its disposal vast resources with which it could adequately protect its loan activities, it is presumed to have conducted the usual "due diligence" in checking and ascertaining the actual status, condition, utilization and occupation of the property offered as collateral.<br><br>The decision was appealed by PDIC and Orient Bank to the HLURB Board of Commissioners via petition for review praying that the same be set aside and/or declared null and void as against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; It was docketed as REM-A-030304-0074.&nbsp; Respondent filed her opposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In a decision dated 16 October 2003, the HLURB Board of Commissioners dismissed the petition and affirmed the decision being assailed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; On 5 December 2003, PDIC and Orient Bank filed a Notice of Appeal manifesting their intention to appeal the decision before the Office of the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> &nbsp;The case was docketed as OP Case No. 03-K-657.<br><br>On 22 March 2004, the Office of the President, through Presidential Assistant Manuel C. Domingo, rendered its decision dismissing the appeal and affirming the decision being appealed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Eastland filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied in an order dated 4 June 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to Rule 43 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Eastland appealed the decision of the Office of the President to the Court of Appeals <span style="font-style: italic;">via </span>petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals dismissed the same for Eastland's failure to append material portions of the record and other supporting papers as well as the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; The motion for reconsideration filed by Eastland was denied in a resolution dated 11 October 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>Petitioner advances the following reasons for the allowance of the petition:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY COMMITTED A REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT DISMISSED THE PETITION FOR REVIEW ON MERE TECHNICAL GROUND WHICH IS FROWN[ED] UPON IN THIS JURISDICTION.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT DELIBERATELY IGNORED THE MERITS OF THE PETITION FOR REVIEW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>On the first assigned error, petitioner argues that while it is desirable that the Rules of Court be faithfully and even meticulously observed, courts should not be so strict about procedural lapses that do not really impair the proper administration of justice.&nbsp; If the rules are intended to insure the orderly conduct of litigation, it is because of higher objective they seek, which is the protection of the substantive rights of the parties.&nbsp; It added that while it inadvertently failed to attach the Verification and Certification against Non-Forum Shopping, including the Secretary's Certificate, the fact remains that it has satisfactorily explained in its motion for reconsideration the reason for its failure to append said documents from which the Court of Appeals could validly rule on the merits of the petition.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that the Court of Appeals should not have deliberately ignored the merits of the case.&nbsp; It contends that it is not guilty of fraud because respondent had constructive notice of the real estate mortgage since the same is inscribed at the dorsal part of the title of the subject lot.&nbsp; Having knowledge that the lot was subjected to a mortgage, respondent is bound thereby and should respect the same.&nbsp; It adds that there being no fraud or bad faith on its part, the award of moral and exemplary damages, including other litigation expenses, is not warranted.<br><br>In her comment dated 14 February 2005, respondent asked that the instant petition be dismissed on the following grounds (1) petitioner did not appeal the decision of the HLURB Arbiter, thereby rendering the said decision final and executory; (2) the decision of the Court of Appeals must be respected and must remain undisturbed; (3) petitioner failed to show any prima facie proof that the HLURB Arbiter, the HLURB Board of Commissioners, the Office of the President, and the Court of Appeals committed errors of fact or law that would warrant the reversal or modification of the orders sought to be nullified; and (4) petitioner is guilty of fraud in dealing with respondent and other buyers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In its Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated 6 May 2005, petitioner asserts that the resolution of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and set aside, and that substantial justice must not be sacrificed in the altar of technicalities and that procedural rules must not be made a deterrent to the ends of justice.<br><br>As required, the parties filed their respective memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The instant petition is DENIED.<br><br>Verily, in numerous occasions, this Court has relaxed the rigid application of the rules to afford the parties the opportunity to fully ventilate their cases on the merits.&nbsp; This is in line with the time-honored principle that cases should be decided only after giving all parties the chance to argue their causes and defenses. &nbsp;Technicality and procedural imperfection should thus not serve as basis of decisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Technicalities should never be used to defeat the substantive rights of the other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Every party-litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of his cause, free from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> &nbsp;In that way, the ends of justice would be better served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; For, indeed, the general objective of procedure is to facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of contending parties, bearing always in mind that procedure is not to hinder but to promote the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></sup><br><br>However, such liberality in the application of rules of procedure may not be invoked if it will result in the wanton disregard of the rules or cause needless delay in the administration of justice.&nbsp; It is equally settled that, save for the most persuasive of reasons, strict compliance is enjoined to facilitate the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></sup><br><br>In the instant case, petitioner's appeal with the Court of Appeals was dismissed for failure to attach portions of the record and other supporting papers as well as the Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping.&nbsp; Its motion for reconsideration was denied notwithstanding that it appended all the required documents.<br><br>It is settled that the requirement to file a certificate of non-forum shopping is mandatory and that the failure to comply with this requirement cannot be excused. The certification is a peculiar and personal responsibility of the party, an assurance given to the court or other tribunal that there are no other pending cases involving basically the same parties, issues and causes of action. Hence, the certification must be accomplished by the party himself because he has actual knowledge of whether or not he has initiated similar actions or proceedings in different courts or tribunals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Section 7 of Rule 43 of the Rules of Civil Procedure states that failure to comply with any of the requirements regarding the payment of the docket and other lawful fees, the deposit for costs, proof of service of the petition, and the contents <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the documents which should accompany the petition shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof.<br><br>This Court is not unmindful that in several cases <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> we considered a flawed certificate of non-forum shopping as substantial compliance when there are circumstances or compelling reasons making the strict application of the rule clearly unwarranted.&nbsp; The nonfiling of the certificate notwithstanding, the Court may, for compelling reason, take cognizance of a petition.<br><br>In the case before us, there is no substantial compliance to speak of because no certificate of non-forum shopping was appended when the petition for review was filed with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The subsequent submission of said certificate on motion for reconsideration will not cure said defect.&nbsp; The rule against forum shopping and the necessity of a certification of non-forum shopping are basic requirements in remedial law.&nbsp; Failure to comply with them constitutes gross negligence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Neither is there any compelling reason that would make us relax the rigid application of the rules.&nbsp; On the contrary, there is one compelling reason that justifies the affirmance of the dismissal of the petition.&nbsp; This reason is: the decision of the Housing and Land Use Arbiter, as to petitioner, had long been final and executory.<br><br>Section 2, Rule XI and Section 1, Rule XII of the 1996 HLRB Rules of Procedure provide:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="text-align: center;">RULE XI<br>Decision<br><div style="text-align: left;">x x x x<br></div></div><br>Section 2.
