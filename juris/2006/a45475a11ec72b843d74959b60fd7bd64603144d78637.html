				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari filed pursuant to Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which seeks to reverse and set aside the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Sandiganbayan dated February 15, 1999 which dismissed petitioners' complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in Civil Case No. 0183 for lack of jurisdiction due to their alleged failure and refusal to pay the correct amount of docket fees.<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>On February 28, 1986, former President Corazon C. Aquino issued Executive Order No. 1 creating the respondent Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) as a collegial body to aid the government in the recovery of the ill-gotten wealth amassed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates, both here and abroad.   To accomplish its objectives, the PCGG was granted vast powers including "the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by . . . (President Marcos, his family and close associates) during his administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationship."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In connection with these orders of sequestration, freezing or takeover, various civil actions for reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution, and damages were instituted by the PCGG in the name of the Republic of the Philippines, against the persons believed to be owners or holders of the property subject thereof.   One of them was former Ambassador Roberto S. Benedicto, an alleged crony of the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was impleaded as a co-defendant in Sandiganbayan Civil Case Nos. 0009, 0024 and 0034.<br><br>On November 3, 1990, Benedicto and the Republic of the Philippines executed a compromise agreement before this Court whereby they settled their controversy in the aforementioned civil cases. Under the compromise agreement, Benedicto surrendered to the respondent PCGG 51% of his equity in Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (ETPI) consisting of 2,652,000 shares of stock which is equivalent to 10.2% of the total capital stock of ETPI.<br><br>Alleging ownership over the aforementioned shares which were ceded by Benedicto to the respondent, the petitioners filed with the Sandiganbayan a complaint for declaration of ownership, accounting, and damages against the respondent PCGG on April 17, 1998, praying that the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos and/or his estate be declared the true and lawful owner of such shares, and for the respondent to render a full accounting of said shares, and to pay the petitioners Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos for moral damages, Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos for exemplary damages and Two Hundred Thousand (P200,000.00) Pesos for attorney's fees as well as the costs of the suit. The petitioners paid a filing fee of Four Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty (P4,850.00) Pesos.<br><br>On June 29, 1998, the respondent filed its answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and the case was set for pre-trial on October 9, 1998. However, at the scheduled pre-trial conference, the Sandiganbayan held the proceedings in abeyance and invited the attention of the  counsel for  the  petitioners  regarding  the lack of amount of filing fees paid invoking Section 7 of   Rule 141 of  the Revised  Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>   Section 4 of  Republic Act  (R.A.) No. 7975<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and the doctrine laid down in the case of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> that the correct amount of filing fees must first be paid, otherwise the court concerned cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>On October 14, 1998, the Sandiganbayan, in open court, issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> directing petitioners to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to their alleged nonpayment of the prescribed docket fee, more particularly the additional amount of One Million Three Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty-Five (P1,326,955.00) Pesos considering the prayer in the complaint that the ownership of the Two Million Six Hundred Fifty-Two Thousand (2,652,000) shares of stock of ETPI (with a par value of One Hundred [P100.00] Pesos per share) be judicially declared in favor of the petitioners.<br><br>Following one request for extension, the petitioners filed their "Response to Show Cause Order dated October 14, 1998,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> on November 17, 1998, stating that the application of Section 7 of Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court in relation to Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975 would result in an unconstitutional diminution or modification of the petitioners' substantive rights under Section 11 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1606,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which, according to petitioners, had not been expressly nor impliedly repealed by R.A. Nos. 7975 and 8249,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which were two later amendatory laws to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Furthermore, they contend that even in the absence of any constitutional proscription, the Sandiganbayan is of the same level as the Court of Appeals, thus, Sections 4 and 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of Rule 141 should be applied as to the filing fees to be paid.<br><br>On February 15, 1999, the Sandiganbayan issued the assailed resolution dismissing Civil Case No. 0183 for lack of jurisdiction due to the failure of petitioners to pay the proper amount of filing fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The petitioners filed their motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on March 10, 1999, and after one request for extension, respondent through counsel filed its comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> on April 7, 1999.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan, in a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated May 24, 1999, denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.  Hence, this present petition where the petitioners submit that the Sandiganbayan, in dismissing the case, erred as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">A.<br></div><br>The inference reached by the Sandiganbayan that the schedule of fees for Regional Trial Courts under Section 7 of Rule 141 applies or should be the one made to apply to it is not readily discernible in Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">B.<br></div><br>Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975 which makes the "Rules of Court promulgated by the Supreme Court" apply to all cases and proceedings filed with the Sandiganbayan" would result in an unconstitutional application of Rule 141 or any section thereof for that matter.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">C.<br></div><br>R.A. Nos. 7579 and 8249 did not expressly repeal Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">D.<br></div><br>Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606 covers even civil cases in light of its forthright and unambiguous terms.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">E.<br></div><br>There is no glaring inconsistency or repugnancy between Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606 and Section 4 of R.A. No. 7975 for the latter to be deemed to have impliedly repealed the former.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">F.<br></div><br>Even in the absence of any constitutional proscription, it is not Section 7 in particular of Rule 141 as to the legal fees payable to Regional Trial Courts which will apply to all cases or proceedings, civil or criminal, before the Sandiganbayan, but Sections 4 and 5 thereof as to the legal fees payable to the Court of Appeals as the latter and the Sandiganbayan are "of the same level."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">G.<br></div><br>No less than the Honorable Court and recent legislation recognize that both the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan are "of the same level."<br></blockquote>As can be culled from the aforementioned assignment of errors, the main issue submitted to this Court for resolution is whether the Sandiganbayan erred in dismissing petitioners' complaint for failure to pay the correct filing fees.<br><br>The petition is unmeritorious.<br><br>In the 2000 case of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yuchengco v. Republic of the Philippines, et al.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> wherein petitioner Yuchengco assailed the Sandiganbayan resolution dismissing his amended complaint-in-intervention for failure to pay the proper docket fee on time, this Court stressed the rule that <span style="font-weight: bold;">parties filing civil actions before the Sandiganbayan are liable to pay the required docket fees.</span>  We ruled:<br><blockquote>" petitioner's position that subsequent amendments to PD 1606 did not expressly repeal Section 11 thereof is untenable. Petitioner failed to appreciate that the expansion of the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction to include civil cases impliedly amended the same and Section 1, Rule IV, Part I of the Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan. Moreover, the Supreme Court enjoys exclusive power to promulgate the rules on pleading, practice, and procedure.<br><br>In addition, Republic Act No. 7975 amended Section 9 of P.D. 1606 to read as follows:<br><blockquote>Rules of Procedure. - The Rules of Court promulgated by the Supreme Court shall apply to all cases and proceedings filed with the Sandiganbayan. . . .<br></blockquote>Hence, Rule 141 Section 7(a) of the Rules of Court applies to petitioner's complaint and/or amended complaints-in-intervention.<br></blockquote>When P.D. No. 1606 and Section 11 thereof, which provides that all proceedings in the Sandiganbayan shall be conducted at no cost to the complainant, were issued on December 10, 1978, the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan was limited to criminal actions. Since then, R.A. Nos. 7975 and 8249 have expanded the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan to include civil cases and resultantly, Section 11 of P.D. No. 1606 should be deemed impliedly amended by the said laws. Thus, Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court on Legal Fees must now be observed by parties filing civil actions before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>We also reject petitioners' contention that Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court on the legal fees payable to the Court of Appeals should apply to the Sandiganbayan, because they are of the same level. Although it could be argued that the Sandiganbayan is of the same level as the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan performs the functions of a trial court and its limited and exclusive appellate jurisdiction covers only appeals from the final judgments, resolutions or orders of regional trial courts where all the accused are occupying positions lower than salary grade 27 or not otherwise covered by the enumeration of certain public officers in Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606 as amended by R.A. No. 8249. Since the cognizance of the present case by the Sandiganbayan is in the exercise of its function as a trial court and not of its appellate function, it is Section 7 of Rule 141 that should apply as to the legal fees to be paid.<br><br>There is another reason why the petition must fail. In the case of S<span style="font-weight: bold;">un Insurance Office Ltd. v. Hon. Maximiano Asuncion,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> laid down the following rules as regards the payment of filing fees:<br><blockquote><ol><li>It is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but [also] the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject-matter or nature of the action. Where the filing of the initiatory pleading is not accompanied by payment of the docket fee, the court may allow payment of the fee within a reasonable time but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.<br><br></li><li>The same rule applies to permissive counterclaims, third-party claims and similar pleadings, which shall not be considered filed until and unless the filing fee prescribed therefor is paid. <span style="font-style: italic;">The court may also allow payment of said fee within a reasonable time but also in no case beyond its applicable prescriptive or reglementary period.<br><br></span></li><li>Where the trial court acquires jurisdiction over a claim by the filing of the appropriate pleading and payment of the prescribed filing fee but, subsequently, the judgment awards a claim not specified in the pleading, or if specified the same has been left for determination by the court, the additional filing fee therefor shall constitute a lien on the judgment. It shall be the responsibility of the Clerk of Court or his duly authorized deputy to enforce said lien and assess and collect the additional fee.</li></ol></blockquote>The rule is clear. It is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate initiatory pleading, but also the payment of the prescribed docket fee, that vests the trial court with jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Payment within "a reasonable time" of the prescribed filing fees may be granted by the courts upon equitable considerations but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or reglementary period. Since the petitioners in the case at bar seek to recover shares of stock, the ownership and possession of which they have been allegedly wrongfully deprived, assuming hypothetically this averment to be true, the legal relationship of constructive trust was present among the parties concerned.<br><br>A constructive trust, otherwise known as an implied trust, is a trust by operation of law which arises contrary to intention and in <span style="font-style: italic;">invitum</span>, against one who, by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of wrong, or by any form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means, or who in any way against equity and good conscience, either has obtained or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, hold and enjoy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is a resulting obligation created by law and actions thereon prescribe after ten (10) years as provided by Article 1144 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, even if we consider the petitioners' right of action for recovery of the shares as having accrued only on November 3, 1990, when Benedicto entered into a compromise agreement with the Republic of the Philippines surrendering the shares in question, or even on the latter period of September 10, 1993, wherein this Court upheld the validity of the compromise agreement, the ten (10)-year prescriptive period has already elapsed. The petitioners, through their belated filing of numerous motions of extensions to file their reply instead of manifesting a willingness to abide by the ruling of the Sandiganbayan on the proper docket fees to be paid, have clearly slept on their rights. Prescription has already set in, thereby barring their right of action.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW WHEREOF</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
