				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appellant Ricardo B. Miranda was charged with Rape in a criminal complaint which reads: <br><blockquote>That on or about the 28th of December 1996, in Barangay San Pedro, Municipality of Guagua, Province of Pampanga, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, RICARDO B. MIRANDA, with lewd designs, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with (sic) Joylene O. Balagtas, a five year old minor, against her will and without&nbsp; her consent. <br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>On arraignment, appellant pleaded "not guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; Trial on the merits then ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses, the victim, 5-year-old Joylene O. Balagtas (Joylene), her mother Georgina<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Balagtas and Dr. Carlos P. Mercado.<sup>[4]</sup><br><br>Joylene testified that in the afternoon of December 28, 1996, she was playing with her friends Lotlot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[</sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">5] </sup>and Shasha<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> near the billiard hall beside appellant's house in San Pedro, Guagua, Pampanga.&nbsp; Appellant who is also known as "Tuko," allegedly approached them and forcibly dragged her inside the house and up the stairs.&nbsp; Upon reaching the second floor, appellant pushed her down on the floor and removed her panties.&nbsp; When Joylene started crying, he covered her mouth with one hand and proceeded to undress himself with the other.<br><br>Appellant tried to insert his penis into Joylene's vagina but was not successful so he inserted his finger into her instead.&nbsp; Joylene cried throughout her ordeal.&nbsp; After a while, appellant told Joylene to leave and come back again next time.&nbsp; Joylene went back to her playmates before going home.&nbsp; She relayed the incident to her mother the next morning.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</span></sup><br><br>Georgina testified that upon learning about the incident, she immediately confronted appellant but he denied the accusation.&nbsp; She then proceeded to the house of their Barangay Captain who instructed her to file a report at the police station.&nbsp; Georgina testified that after the incident, Joylene had trouble sleeping, became withdrawn and no longer played with her friends like she used to.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</span></sup>&nbsp; She also testified that Joylene was born on July 1, 1991 and was 5 years old when the incident happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Dr. Carlos P. Mercado testified that on January 19, 1997, he examined Joylene and found her "conscious, coherent and ambulatory."&nbsp; Her genitals appeared normal except for superficial abrasions on the lateral sides of the labia minora which could have been caused by a hard, sharp object. Her vagina admits a little finger and there were fresh abrasions on her vulva, between her anus and her vagina.&nbsp; Dr. Mercado also noted that Joylene was in a state of trauma and was initially unwilling to relate her ordeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]&nbsp;</sup> When asked whether the abrasions could have been caused by a penis, Dr. Mercado stated that only the fingers were used on the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The defense presented appellant as its sole witness.&nbsp; He denied the charge against him and maintained that he did not see Joylene on the day of the alleged rape because he stayed home to take care of his chidren.<br><br>Appellant claimed that in the morning of December 29, 1996, Joylene and her sister J.L. called him to their house because their mother wanted him to fetch water for them.&nbsp; Later that same morning, he claimed that Georgina called him again and upon entering the house, the latter physically attacked him and forced him to admit to having raped Joylene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; When he refused, he was brought to the police station.&nbsp; He maintained that he was in good terms with the family of the victim and could not think of any reason why they would accused him of such crime.<br><br>After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Guagua, Pampanga, Branch 49 rendered judgment<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13] </span></sup>convicting appellant of the crime of rape, the dispositive portion of which states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered finding the accused Ricardo B. Miranda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentencing him to the extreme penalty of death. Accused is further directed to pay the offended party Joylene Balagtas the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Conformably with this Court's decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Mateo</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> appellant's appeal by way of automatic review was transferred to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; On June 16, 2005, the appellate court rendered its decision<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</span></sup> affirming appellant's conviction.<br><br>Appellant raises the following errors in this petition for review:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>GRANTING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY OF THE CRIME CHARGED, THE TRIAL COURT, HOWEVER, ERRED IN IMPOSING UPON HIM THE SUPREME PENALTY OF DEATH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Appellant maintains that the test of moral certainty and standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt required for conviction in criminal cases have not been satisfactorily attained.&nbsp; He argues that assuming he is found guilty, the evidence adduced by the prosecution only establishes that he inserted his finger in Joylene's vagina, an offense which falls squarely under paragraph 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; He contends that the death penalty imposed upon him should be reduced accordingly pursuant to Article 266-B which provides that "object rape" under paragraph 2 of Article 266-A shall be punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>.<br><br>Any review of a rape case begins with the settled reality that accusing a person of this crime can be done with facility.&nbsp; Thus, the testimony of the complainant must always be scrutinized with great caution.&nbsp; It may not be easy for her to prove the commission of rape; yet it is even more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove his guilt.&nbsp; This principle must be viewed in relation to that which holds that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits; it cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Where the life of another human being hangs on the balance, nothing but proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the accused is charged must be established in order for the corresponding penalty thereto to be upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Findings of facts of the trial courts carry great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless shown to be contrary to facts or circumstances of weight and substance in the record. For, generally, the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by trial courts, because of their unique opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor, conduct, and attitude, especially under cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In this case, however, we have to depart from this settled rule because the evidence on record does not fully sustain the trial court's findings and conclusions.<br><br>During direct examination, Joylene testified that:<br><blockquote><div align="justify"><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

However, since the offense occurred on December 28, 1996 or prior to the effectivity of the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, the same finds no application in this case.<br><br>We now come to the penalty.<br><br>Under Article 51 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty to be imposed upon persons found guilty of an attempted crime is the penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by law for the consummated felony.&nbsp; The penalty for consummated rape is death, pursuant to Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 or the Death Penalty Law, since Joylene was below 7 years old when raped.&nbsp; The penalty for attempted rape is<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion temporal </span>which is two degrees lower than that prescribed for consummated rape.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the appellant may be sentenced to an indeterminate imprisonment penalty whose minimum is within the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span>, that is, six (6) years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years and whose maximum shall be within the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal </span>in its medium period pursuant to Article 64(1) of the Revised Penal Code, the range of which is fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months.<br><br>As to the amount of damages, prevailing jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> sets the amount of the civil indemnity in attempted rape at P30,000.00.
