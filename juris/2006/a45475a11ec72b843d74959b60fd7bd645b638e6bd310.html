Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution's version of the facts of the two criminal cases is as follows: Around 7:00 p.m. of April 14, 1990, brothers Roque Ferrer (Roque) and Ricardo Ferrer (Ricardo) were on their way to the house of their father in Barangay Olo-Cafabrosan, Mangatarem, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; When they were near the house of their father, they heard someone shout the words, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Dumating na ang mga mayabang.</span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9] </sup>They discovered that it was their cousin, Ramon, who uttered said words.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>Ramon was in the yard fronting his father's house which is adjacent to the house of the father of Roque and Ricardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup>Ramon was then in the middle of a drinking spree with his brother Tommy, the latter's wife Che-Che and two other companions whom Roque and Ricardo did not recognize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Upon hearing the words uttered by Ramon, Roque stopped and asked him who he was referring to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13] </sup>In the meantime, Ricardo proceeded to the house of their father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> After asking Ramon and without getting a response from him, Roque followed Ricardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Upon reaching their father's house, Roque was met at the door by Ricardo and was told by the latter that he is going to ask Ramon why he made those remarks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Roque proceeded to enter their father's house but later went out and followed his brother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the meantime, Ricardo was able to confront Ramon.&nbsp; However, Ramon did not answer when Ricardo asked him why he spoke words apparently referring to them as "<span style="font-style: italic;">mayabang"</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18] </sup>Since Ramon did not answer his question, Ricardo was about to go away when Roque approached them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Without any warning, Ramon stabbed Roque with a kitchen knife hitting his stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]&nbsp;</sup> Ricardo immediately held Ramon's right arm to prevent him from further stabbing Roque.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> At that instant, Tommy and Che-Che moved toward them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22] </sup>Tommy suddenly stabbed Ricardo's back twice with an ice pick causing him to release his hold on Ramon's arm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23] </sup>After stabbing Ricardo, Tommy proceeded to stab Roque twice on his "right side".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Che-Che then started hitting Roque's back with a bamboo pole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25] </sup>Ramon, on the other hand, stabbed Ricardo twice on the right side of his waist.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26] </span></sup>After stabbing Ricardo, he resumed attacking Roque and again stabbed him twice on his chest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> When Ramon, Tommy and Che-Che noticed Roque to be bloody, they ran away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It was then that Roque and Ricardo's sister-in-law, Leonila Ferrer (Leonila), summoned them to board the jeepney parked near their father's house in order for them to be brought to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29] </sup>Roque proceeded to board the vehicle but when he was near the jeepney he was hit on the forehead by a drinking glass thrown by Robert Tan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30] </sup>Roque was eventually able to get on the jeepney.&nbsp; Ricardo drove the vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31] </sup>They were able to reach their uncle's house half a kilometer away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> From there they were rushed to Mangatarem Hospital where first aid was administered to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; They were then brought to Tarlac Provincial Hospital where they were further treated and confined for four days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup>Thereafter, Ricardo was discharged from the hospital while Roque was transferred to the Chinese General Hospital where he stayed for another four days before being released.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]&nbsp;</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the following is the account of the defense:&nbsp; Between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. of April 14, 1990, Ramon and his brother Tommy, together with their wives Lucia and Che-Che, respectively, and a visitor, Tommy Gallano, were gathered in front of the house of Ramon and Tommy's father at Olo-Cafabrosan, Mangatarem, Pangasinan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; They were in the midst of merrymaking and were being entertained by Tommy's son who was dancing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> While watching his nephew dance, Ramon remarked, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ang yabang talaga ng aking pamangkin</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> At that moment, it happened that brothers Roque and Ricardo were passing by.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39] </sup>They proceeded directly to their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]&nbsp;</sup> A few minutes later, Roque went out of their house and went towards the group of Ramon and Tommy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41] </sup>When Roque was approaching, Tommy stood up and asked him what the problem was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]&nbsp;

Thereafter, Ricardo arrived, armed with a jungle bolo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]&nbsp;</sup> Upon seeing that Ricardo was armed, Ramon, Tommy and Che-Che ran and went inside their father's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Their other companions followed suit.&nbsp; Tommy Gallano and Ricardo's wife closed the main door while Tommy proceeded to the back door to keep watch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50] </sup>Meanwhile, Ricardo gave the jungle bolo to Roque who proceeded to follow Ramon and Tommy's group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51] </sup>The entrance to the main door is through a stairs which is about five feet high.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]&nbsp;</sup> Roque went up the stairs and, despite seeing the main door closed, insisted on entering the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53] </sup>By pushing, he was able to pry the door open and half of his body was able to enter the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54] </sup>At that moment, Ramon went to their kitchen, took a knife and stabbed Roque's stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]&nbsp;</sup> Despite being stabbed, Roque still insisted on getting inside the house.&nbsp; Ramon then went out of the house through the back door and proceeded to go to the main door where Roque was.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56] </sup>When he saw that Roque was still trying to force his way inside the house, he stabbed him, hitting his back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57] </sup>When Ramon noticed Ricardo approaching, he also stabbed him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58] </sup>After wounding Roque and Ricardo, Ramon went inside his father's house and closed the door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59] </sup>Thereafter, they heard that Roque and Ricardo were brought to the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; Fearing that they might be the victims of retaliation, Ramon and Tommy together with their other companions proceeded to the house of a certain Councilor Sabado and spent the night there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]&nbsp;</sup> The following morning, Tommy went to Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>After trial, the lower court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: <br><blockquote>WHEREFORE IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, it is the Judgment of this Court: <br><br>In Criminal Case No. L-4302 for Frustrated Homicide, the Court finds the accused Ramon Ferrer and Tommy Ferrer GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Attempted Homicide without the attendance of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law hereby sentences each of the accused to suffer imprisonment [of] 6 months of <span style="font-style: italic;">arresto mayor&nbsp; </span>as minimum to 2 years 4 months and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>as maximum;&nbsp;<br><br>In Criminal Case No. L-4303 for frustrated homicide, the Court finds the accused Ramon Ferrer and Tommy Ferrer GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Frustrated Homicide without the attendance of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and applying the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law hereby sentences each of the accused to suffer imprisonment of 2 years 4 months and 1 day of<span style="font-style: italic;"> prision correcciona</span>l as minimum to 8 years and 1 day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> as maximum.<br><br>The said accused Ramon Ferrer and Tommy Ferrer are ordered to pay solidarily the following amounts: <br><ol><li> To Roque Ferrer – The sum of P1,809.45 representing medical expenses; P11,979.60 representing unrealized earnings; P5,000.00 as expenses of litigation; and moral damages of P10,000.00 for a total of P28,789.05; <br><br></li><li> To Ricardo Ferrer – The sum of P2,000.00 as hospitalization and medical expenses; P10,000.00 as unrealized earnings; P5,000.00 as expenses in attending the hearings; and P8,000.00 as moral damages; for [a total of] P25,000.00 without subsidiary liability in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.</li></ol>With respect to the accused Cheche Ferrer, the Court finds her Not Guilty for lack of evidence.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved by the trial court's decision, Ramon and Tommy appealed to the CA.<br><br>In the presently assailed Decision, the CA affirmed the judgment of the RTC.&nbsp; The CA denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Ramon and Tommy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Hence, the present petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> filed by Tommy Ferrer (petitioner) only, raising the following issues:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS OVERLOOKED CERTAIN FACTS OF SUBSTANCE AND VALUE THAT, IF CONSIDERED, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THE ACQUITTAL OF THE PETITIONER HEREIN. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION CAN SUSTAIN THE CONVICTION OF THE PETITIONER HEREIN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br></blockquote>As in their appeal filed with the CA, the issues presented by petitioner in the instant petition boil down to the question of credibility of the witnesses.&nbsp; In both issues, petitioner contends that Ricardo and Roque's claim that he (petitioner) stabbed them should not be given credence because their testimonies are devoid of any factual basis.&nbsp; To support his contention, petitioner asserts that there are inconsistencies between the testimonies of Ricardo and Roque, on one hand, and the testimony of Dr.&nbsp; Tañedo, the physician who treated their wounds, on the other.&nbsp; Petitioner cites the separate testimonies of Roque and Ricardo wherein they claimed that petitioner stabbed both of them; and that based on the testimony of Ricardo, petitioner used an ice pick in stabbing them.&nbsp; Petitioner alleges that the testimonies of Ricardo and Roque were directly contradicted by the testimony of Dr. Tañedo when the latter testified that the injuries sustained by Ricardo and Roque were caused by a "sharp instrument" or "sharp bladed instrument."&nbsp; Petitioner argues that an ice pick is neither a "sharp instrument" nor a "sharp bladed instrument."&nbsp; Concluding that a wound caused by an ice pick is a puncture wound, he then cites Dr. Tañedo's testimony that the latter did not see any puncture wounds when he treated Ricardo and Roque.&nbsp; In other words, petitioner makes much of the fact that none of the wounds of Ricardo and Roque were found by the examining physician as puncture wounds vis-à-vis Ricardo's testimony that petitioner used an ice pick in stabbing him.&nbsp; Petitioner also reasons out that the trial court did not give credence to the testimony of Roque Ferrer that he was hit on his right ear with a bamboo pole by Che-Che Ferrer; instead it (the trial court) relied on the testimony of Dr. Tañedo that the injury on the right ear of Roque is a stab wound caused by a sharp instrument; consequently, it exonerated Che-Che for lack of evidence to prove her liability.&nbsp; Based on this premise, petitioner proceeds to argue that since Dr. Tañedo testified that none of the injuries sustained by Ricardo and Roque is a puncture wound, the claims of the latter that petitioner stabbed them with an ice pick should not also be given credence and, thus, petitioner should also be acquitted.&nbsp;<br><br>We are not persuaded.&nbsp;<br><br>First, while Ricardo testified that the weapon used by petitioner is an ice pick, Roque did not claim that petitioner used an ice pick in stabbing him or his brother, Ricardo.&nbsp; In fact, Roque testified that he did not notice the weapon used by petitioner when the latter stabbed Ricardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]&nbsp;</sup><br><br>Second, Dr. Tañedo testified that the injuries sustained by Ricardo and Roque were probably caused by a "sharp instrument", contrary to petitioner's claim that the wounds were caused by a "sharp-bladed instrument."&nbsp; While Dr. Tañedo admits that a knife could produce the kinds of wounds sustained by Ricardo and Roque there is nothing in the testimony of the doctor which discounts the possibility that said injuries could have also been caused by other weapons such as an ice pick. In fact, the testimony of Dr. Tañedo is consistent with the definition cited by petitioner and his brother in their appeal brief filed with the CA, which, however, is omitted in their present petition, that "an ice pick is a <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">sharp</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">, </span>pointed kitchen or bar implement for cracking ice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]&nbsp; </sup>Moreover, Dr. Tañedo did not testify nor did the defense present any evidence to prove that an ice pick could only cause a puncture wound.<br><br>Third, we cannot give credit to petitioner's reliance on the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Mozar</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> wherein this Court held that the nature of the injuries sustained by the deceased demolishes the credibility of the prosecution witness' story that he saw the other accused hack the deceased because it was found out later that the victim did not sustain any hack wound.&nbsp; In the present case, there is no dispute that Ricardo and Roque sustained multiple stab wounds.&nbsp; Together with prosecution witness Leonila, they unanimously identified Ramon and Tommy as their assailants.&nbsp;<br><br>Granting that Ricardo erred in claiming that Tommy used an ice pick in stabbing him and Roque, it is a settled rule that witnesses are not expected to remember every single detail of an incident with perfect or total recall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]&nbsp;</sup> Even if the offended party may have erred in some aspects of his testimony, the same does not necessarily impair his testimony nor corrode his credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; Where a part of the testimony of a witness runs counter to the medical evidence submitted, it is within the sound discretion of the court to determine which portions of the testimony to reject as false and which to consider worthy of belief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]&nbsp;</sup> In the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Lucena</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72] </sup>we held that: <br><blockquote>Modern trend in jurisprudence favors more flexibility when the testimony of a witness may be partly believed and partly disbelieved depending on the corroborative evidence presented at the trial.&nbsp; Thus, where the challenged testimony is sufficiently corroborated in its material points, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">where the mistakes arise from innocent lapses and not from an apparent desire to pervert the truth, the rule may be relaxed.&nbsp; </span>It is a rule that is neither absolute nor mandatory and binding upon the court, which may accept or reject portions of the witness' testimony based on its inherent credibility or on the corroborative evidence in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73] </sup>(Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>In the present case, Ricardo's testimony – that it was Tommy and Ramon who assaulted him and Roque and that they sustained various injuries by reason of such attack – is corroborated in its material points by the testimonies of the other prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; Roque testified as follows:&nbsp; <br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">FISCAL ABELON</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>xxx</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">With whom was your brother talk (sic) in front of the house of Delfin Ferrer?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td> <div align="justify">Ramon Ferrer, maam.&nbsp;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">When you saw your brother Ricardo Ferrer and Ramon Ferrer talking, what did you do?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">I went near them, maam.&nbsp;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">What happened next when you went near them?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td> <div align="justify">Upon getting near them, Ramon Ferrer immediately stab (sic) me, maam or suddenly stabbed me.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q</td><td><div align="justify">What part of your body was stabbed by Ramon Ferrer?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>A</td><td><div align="justify">I was first stabbed or hit in the stomach, maam.

Dr. Tañedo testified that all the injuries sustained by Roque and Ricardo were stab wounds caused by a sharp instrument.&nbsp; This finding is not negated by Ricardo's testimony that the weapon used by petitioner in stabbing him was an ice pick.&nbsp; Rather, this finding is consistent with the positive statements of Roque and Leonila that petitioner stabbed Ricardo and Roque.&nbsp; In other words, insofar as the criminal liability of petitioner is concerned, we find nothing inconsistent between the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, on one hand, and the medical findings of Dr. Tañedo, on the other.<br><br>Against the positive identification of Ricardo, Roque and Leonila, all that petitioner could interpose as defense is denial, which, under settled jurisprudence, could not prevail over the positive testimony of witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]&nbsp; </sup>Denial is intrinsically a weak defense which must be buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]&nbsp;</sup> To be sure, it is negative, self-serving evidence that cannot be given evidentiary weight greater than that of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]&nbsp;</sup> Time-tested is the rule that between the positive assertions of prosecution witnesses and the negative averments of the accused, the former indisputably deserve more credence and evidentiary weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]&nbsp;</sup><br><br>Petitioner insists that his defense does not consist of bare denial.&nbsp; He claims that his testimony is corroborated by the testimonies of prosecution witness Dr. Tañedo and of his (petitioner's) brother, Ramon.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>The testimony of Dr. Tañedo does not corroborate petitioner's defense of denial because, as we have earlier discussed, it does not disregard the possibility that the stab wounds sustained by Ricardo and Roque were caused by an ice pick.&nbsp; There is nothing in the testimony of Dr. Tañedo that an ice pick can only produce a puncture wound.&nbsp; It is only petitioner's assumption and conclusion that an ice pick can only cause a puncture wound.&nbsp;<br><br>Ramon attempted to corroborate petitioner's denial by testifying that he (Ramon) alone stabbed Ricardo and Roque and that he inflicted two wounds on Roque and only one wound on Ricardo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>&nbsp; However, the same does not inspire belief.&nbsp; The physical evidence does not support Ramon's testimony because the medical certificates issued by Dr. Tañedo showed that Roque sustained six stab wounds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88] </sup>while Ricardo had four stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]&nbsp;</sup> It follows that someone else must have inflicted the other wounds of Roque and Ricardo.&nbsp; Based on the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Roque, Ricardo and Leonila, both petitioner and Ramon stabbed Roque and Ricardo.&nbsp; The physical evidence taken together with the testimonies of Ramon, Roque, Ricardo and Leonila point to the inevitable conclusion that petitioner inflicted stab wounds on Roque and Ricardo.&nbsp;<br><br>In other words, the prosecution sufficiently established the fact that petitioner was seen stabbing Ricardo and Roque with a weapon and that they sustained stab wounds by reason of such attack.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Moreover, as to the location of the wounds, it must be noted that most of the stab wounds sustained by Roque (on the right and left sides of his chest and on the right side of his abdomen) and Ricardo (on the left side of the abdomen and on the left and right lower back) are located either at the thoracic or abdominal areas, which are delicate portions of the body.&nbsp; It is in these areas that vital organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, gall bladder, spleen, and pancreas are located.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]&nbsp;</sup> A penetrating wound in any of these spots may cause grave injuries that can lead to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]&nbsp; &nbsp;</sup><br><br>In the case of Ricardo, while Dr. Tañedo testified that the wounds sustained by the former are classified as minor injuries and that these wounds would not normally cause death, he also declared that it is possible that complications which could be fatal would have arisen if no medical intervention was made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>&nbsp; The nature of the weapons used as well as the nature and location of the wounds inflicted upon Ricardo and Roque undoubtedly established petitioner's and Ramon's intent to kill the victims.&nbsp; Thus, the CA did not err in finding petitioner and Ramon guilty of Attempted Homicide in Criminal Case No. L-4302 and Frustrated Homicide in Criminal Case No. L-4303.&nbsp;<br><br>It is a well-settled rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case wide open for review and that it becomes the duty of the Court to correct such errors as may be found in the judgment appealed from, whether they are assigned as errors or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> <br><br>Based on the evidence adduced, we find that the lower courts erred in awarding some of the damages in favor of the victims, insofar as herein petitioner is concerned.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>First, we find the award of P10,000.00 in favor of Roque and P10,000.00 in favor of Ricardo, as compensation for unrealized earnings, improper for lack of evidence to prove the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation&nbsp; for&nbsp; lost income is in the nature of damages and&nbsp; requires&nbsp; due&nbsp; proof&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; amount&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; damage&nbsp; suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]&nbsp;</sup> In the present case, aside from the self-serving testimony of Ricardo, the prosecution failed to present any other proof to substantiate his claim of lost earnings.&nbsp;<br><br>Second, the award of P2,000.00 in favor of Ricardo, representing hospitalization and medical expenses is likewise improper for lack of proof to substantiate the same.&nbsp; As correctly held by the trial court, Ricardo failed to present receipts of payment when he claimed the amount of P2,000.00 as his expenses for hospitalization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, Roque was able to present receipts to prove his medical expenses.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Third, the award of P8,000.00 as moral damages in favor of Ricardo is also unsubstantiated and, therefore, should be deleted, as he did not testify on any emotional distress, mental anguish or even physical suffering which he suffered as a result of the crime.&nbsp; While no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary, it is essential that the claimant should satisfactorily provide factual basis for the alleged moral injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>&nbsp; Nonetheless, we find the award of moral damages in favor of Roque to be in order since he testified that he suffered pain even at the time that he was being discharged from the hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]&nbsp;</sup><br><br>Fourth, we find the award of P5,000.00, as "expenses of litigation" and "expenses in attending the hearings" in favor of Roque and Ricardo, respectively, to be without basis.&nbsp; Article 2208 of the Civil Code provides, among others, that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, may be recovered in cases where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.&nbsp; However, considering that the grant of attorney's fees and litigation expenses under this provision of law is in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, it is necessary for the court to make findings of fact and law and give good reasons in granting such an award.&nbsp; Thus, in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Colonia</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> we disallowed the award of litigation expenses and ruled as follows: <br><blockquote>Regarding the attorney's fees and litigation expenses, Article 2208 of the New Civil Code enumerates the instances where such may be awarded and, in any event, it must be reasonable, just and equitable.&nbsp; Attorney's fees as part of damages are not meant to enrich the winning party at the expense of the losing litigant.&nbsp; They are not awarded every time a party prevails in a suit because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate.&nbsp; The award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the rule.&nbsp; As such, it is necessary for the court to make findings of fact and law that would bring the case within the exception and justify the grant of such award.&nbsp; Aside from the dispositive portion, nothing was ever said by the trial court in the body of the decision to justify the award of attorney's fees and litigation expenses.&nbsp; Hence, we disallow them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>In the instant case, a perusal of the trial court's decision shows that the trial court did not make any findings or discussions to justify the award of litigation expenses.&nbsp; Moreover, a review of the records indicates that while Roque testified that he and his brother spent money in attending the hearings before the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> no documentary evidence was presented to prove the actual expenses that they incurred.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
