On one hand, the testimony of Geodetic Engineer Ernesto Erive showed that petitioner's property is located in Xavierville, while respondent's is in Tandang Sora.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, Benjamin Bustos, testified that the lot described in the title of the Bank of Commerce is identical with the lot described in respondent's title.&nbsp; This was allegedly corroborated in the Order of Reconstitution issued by Bustos, stating that "[T]he lot described in TCT No. 265907 is identical to the lot described in TCT No. 265984 issued in the name of spouses Miguel Uy and Carmela Lim and was ordered reconstituted under administrative Order No. Q-366 on September 23, 1992."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC also ruled that the filing of the action for Quieting of Title by the Bank of Commerce on February 1, 1997, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-30333, amounts to an implied admission that the two titles cover the same property.&nbsp; Given these, the RTC concluded that petitioner's and respondent's titles refer to the same property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The RTC also ruled that respondent was in prior possession of the property inasmuch as the Deed of Sale between respondent and Quesada, which was executed on June 7, 1993, amounts to possession in legal contemplation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The CA upheld the RTC's findings and conclusion.&nbsp; The CA ruled that respondent has a better right to the property since the sale between her and Quesada was on June 7, 1993, while the Contract to Sell between petitioner and the Bank of Commerce was dated September 6, 1995.&nbsp; While the testimony of Engineer Erive may have cast a doubt or cloud on respondent's title, still, until there is a judicial declaration as regards its nullity, then respondent's title remains valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The CA also found that respondent had prior possession of the property, which began in 1993, and petitioner encroached on such possession.&nbsp; While respondent did not stay on the property, her regular visits are the same as being in possession thereof.&nbsp; The CA acknowledged that the tax declarations in the name of respondent are indications that strengthened her claim of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; With regard to the testimony of Engineer Erive on the identity of the property, the CA held that this can be properly threshed out in Civil Case No. Q-97-30333 presently pending with the RTC of Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Petitioner takes exception to the foregoing findings of the RTC and the CA.&nbsp; Petitioner argues that despite the execution of the Deed of Sale, respondent was never in actual and physical possession of the property prior to the filing of the forcible entry case, unlike petitioner who was able to build improvements thereon.&nbsp; Petitioner also argues that his predecessor-in-interest, the Bank of Commerce, has also been in prior possession of the property, as shown by the fence it built around the area even before it was sold to petitioner.&nbsp; The Bank of Commerce's lack of title over the property can be explained by the fact that it was pending reconstitution and the title was in fact already reconstituted during the pendency of the case.<br><br>Petitioner also objects to the admission by the RTC of respondent's tax declarations since it was presented only for the first time during the appellate proceedings.&nbsp; Even then, petitioner maintains that the tax declarations do not establish respondent's actual physical possession.<br><br>Finally, petitioner asserts that the evidence presented clearly indicates that property described in respondent's title is not the same property bought by petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>At the outset, it should be stated that as a general rule, the Court will not entertain petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which raise questions of fact, as its power of judicial review is confined only to errors of law. Considering, however, that the CA and the RTC came up with contradictory findings with that of the MeTC, the Court is now constrained to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence presented in the proceedings below, as it is clearly an exception to the general rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>An action for forcible entry is a quieting process that is summary in nature.&nbsp; It is designed to recover physical possession through speedy proceedings that are restrictive in nature, scope and time limits. In forcible entry, the plaintiff is deprived of physical possession by means of force, intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth. The presence of any of these elements in the present case implies that the possession of the disputed land by the defendant has been unlawful from the beginning; that is, he acquired possession by illegal means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The principal issue to be resolved in forcible entry cases is mere physical or material possession (possession <i>de facto</i>) and not juridical possession (possession <i>de jure</i>) nor ownership of the property involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Title is not involved.&nbsp; Thus, in <i>David v. Cordova</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court explained:<blockquote>The only question that the courts must resolve in ejectment proceedings is -who is entitled to the physical possession of the premises, that is, to the possession <i>de facto</i> and not to the possession <i>de jure</i>. <b>It does not even matter if a party's title to the property is questionable</b>, or when both parties intruded into public land and their applications to own the land have yet to be approved by the proper government agency. <b>Regardless of the actual condition of the title to the property, the party in peaceable quiet possession shall not be thrown out by a strong hand, violence or terror.</b> Neither is the unlawful withholding of property allowed. Courts will always uphold respect for prior possession.<br><br><b>Thus, a party who can prove prior possession can recover such possession even against the owner himself. Whatever may be the character of his possession, if he has in his favor prior possession in time, he has the security that entitles him to remain on the property until a person with a better right lawfully ejects him.</b> To repeat, the only issue that the court has to settle in an ejectment suit is the right to physical possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>It is also well settled that in civil cases, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish his case by a preponderance of evidence. If the plaintiff claims a right granted or created by law, the same must be proven by competent evidence.&nbsp; The plaintiff must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of his opponent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, it devolved upon respondent to show by preponderance of evidence that she was illegally deprived of possession of the property subject of the forcible entry case for her to obtain judgment in her favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Coming now to the issue of who, as between petitioner and respondent, has priority in possession of the property, the Court notes, at this juncture, a basic error in the decisions of the MeTC, RTC, and the CA, which should be rectified.&nbsp; All three courts entertained the impression that petitioner's possession is based on his claim of ownership of the property.&nbsp; This is not so.&nbsp; It should be pointed out that petitioner's right to possess the property is not derived from any claim of ostensible ownership over the same but on the provision in the Contract to Sell allowing him to take possession of the property pending reconstitution of the title and full payment of the purchase price.&nbsp; Ownership remained in the name of the Bank of Commerce, and petitioner is yet to become the owner of the property at the time the ejectment proceedings were had.&nbsp; This is simply because in a contract to sell, ownership is, by agreement, reserved in the vendor and is not to pass to the vendee until full payment of the purchase price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, The Bank of Commerce can even avail of the remedy of ejectment against petitioner in case the latter defaults payment since the former retains ownership of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]&nbsp; </sup>While this particular issue was neither raised nor brought up, the Court, nevertheless, deems it necessary to bring it up, in the interest of substantial justice and to avoid further litigation on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It has been ruled that a plaintiff in an ejectment case cannot succeed where it appears that, as between himself and the defendant, the latter had a possession antedating his own. To ascertain this, it is proper to look at the situation as it existed before the first act of spoliation occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As borne by the records, petitioner claims actual and physical possession of the property, while respondent claims possession through an ostensible ownership over the property.&nbsp; With regard to petitioner, his claim of right to possession is derived from the Contract to Sell between him and his wife as buyers, and the Bank of Commerce as seller.&nbsp; Based on said contract, petitioner was allowed to take possession of the property.&nbsp; In turn, the Bank of Commerce (then the Overseas Bank of Manila) bought the property from the Xavierville Estate, Inc. in a Deed of Sale of Real Estate dated September 8, 1967, and from which TCT No. 265907 issued on December 5, 1979 was based.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent's claim of possession over the property is based on an Absolute Deed of Sale of Real Estate dated June 7, 1993 between respondent and Christine Quesada, and by virtue of which, TCT No. 87569 was issued in her name on June 8, 1993.&nbsp; TCT No. 87569 was traced back to Ana Maria Pilarta Figueras, who was the previous holder of TCT No. 76045 issued on January 6, 1993, and from whom Quesada bought the property. Meanwhile, TCT No. 80618 in the name of Quesada was issued on February 18, 1993.<br><br>Given the surrounding circumstances of this case, the Court finds that petitioner is in prior possession of the property, and is entitled to remain therein.<br><br>First, while it may be true that the Absolute Deed of Sale of Real Estate between respondent and Christine Quesada was executed on June 7, 1993, prior to the Contract to Sell between petitioner and the Bank of Commerce on September 6, 1995, it should be emphasized that the execution of a deed of sale is merely a <i>prima facie</i> presumption of delivery of possession of a piece of real property, which is destroyed when the delivery is not effected because of a legal impediment.&nbsp; Said constructive or symbolic delivery, being merely presumptive, may be negated by the failure of the vendee to take actual possession of the land sold,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as in respondent's case.&nbsp; Records show that respondent never occupied the property from the time it was allegedly sold to her on June 7, 1993 or at any time thereafter.<br><br>Respondent, however, maintains that her "regular" visits to the property constitute possession.&nbsp; In <i>Dela Rosa v.
