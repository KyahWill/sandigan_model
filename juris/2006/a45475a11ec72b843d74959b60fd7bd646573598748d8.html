				<BR><STRONG>CORONA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us are two petitions for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 28, 2000 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 41399, the dispositive portion of which read:<blockquote>THE FOREGOING CONSIDERED, the Amended Decision while AFFIRMED, is hereby MODIFIED, by also directing the [South Pacific Plastic Manufacturing Corporation] to pay the [Manila Electric Company] P100,000.00 exemplary damages and P25,000.00 attorney's fees.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>The Manila Electric Company (Meralco) is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws engaged in the distribution and sale of electric power.&nbsp; South Pacific Plastic Manufacturing Corporation (South Pacific) is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws engaged in the manufacture, sale and exportation of plastic products. Both assail the decision of the CA via separate petitions for review.&nbsp; The cases were consolidated by this Court in a resolution dated July 18, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The facts, as summarized by the CA, are as follows:<blockquote>South Pacific and Manila Electric Company (Meralco) were parties to several Contracts of Services under four (4) Contract Account Numbers, namely, Account Numbers 9487-4712-12, 9487-4922-18, 9487-902216 and 9487-9212-16.&nbsp; Under these contracts, Meralco agreed to supply South Pacific with electric power at the latter's factory located at T. Santiago Street, Canumay, Valenzuela, Metro Manila.<br><br>In consideration for Meralco's services, South Pacific agreed to pay the former its monthly billings as determined by the four (4) electric supply reading instruments to which the aforementioned account numbers have been assigned respectively.&nbsp; These electric meter instruments were installed by Meralco in South Pacific's premises.<br><br>Under the contract of services, both parties agreed that:<blockquote>"6.&nbsp; The monthly bills for electric service rendered shall be paid by the CUSTOMER to collectors or at the COMPANY'S main or branch offices or at its authorized banks within ten (10) days from the date said bills are presented for payment and should the CUSTOMER fail to pay any of the bills under this agreement or any other agreements, whether prior or present, with the COMPANY when due <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or should the CUSTOMER fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this agreement or any other agreements the COMPANY shall have the right to discontinue the supply of electric energy</span> at the expiration of five (5) days from and after delivery to the CUSTOMER of a written notice to this effect.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div></blockquote>CUSTOMER'S LIABILITY<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><blockquote>Customers will be held responsible for tampering, interfering with, or breaking of seals of meters or other equipment of the Company installed on the Customer's premises, and shall be held liable for the same according to law.</blockquote></span>PAYMENTS:<blockquote>xxx&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the event of the stoppage or the failure by any meter to register the full amount of energy consumed, the Customer shall be billed for such period on an estimated consumption based upon his use of energy in a similar period of like use.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div></blockquote>DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE<blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The company reserves the right to discontinue service</span> in case the Customer is in arrears in the payment of bills or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for failure to pay the adjusted bills in those cases where the meter stopped or failed to register the correct amount of energy consumed</span>, or for failure to comply with any of these terms and conditions, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or in the case of or to prevent fraud upon the Company</span>.&nbsp; Before disconnection is made in the case of or to prevent fraud, the Company may adjust the bill of said Customer accordingly and if the adjusted bill is not paid, the Company may disconnect the same. xxx"&nbsp;</blockquote>For several years, Meralco continuously supplied South Pacific with electric power.&nbsp; The latter, in turn, regularly paid its bills for electric consumption as registered in the metering devices installed by Meralco.<br><br>In 1981, however, South Pacific began receiving notices from Meralco demanding payment for certain amounts representing electric power consumption allegedly not reflected on South Pacific's electric meters, and which was allegedly due to the defective electric meters installed in the latter's premises.<br><br>A routine inspection on the metering facilities at South Pacific's, and in the presence of the latter's representative officer on numerous occasions starting June 1981 until 198<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>, however, revealed that the four (4) electric meters installed therein were defective and were allegedly found to be tampered.&nbsp; For some time, said meters had been allegedly reflecting unusually lower power consumption by South Pacific than it actually used, as a result of which, the latter had not been paying the corresponding amount for its actual electricity consumption, thus, causing Meralco to sustain undue losses.<br><br>Based on the results of, and findings at the inspection and the consequent laboratory tests, Meralco determined the number of kilowatt hours in unregistered electric energy actually used covering certain periods when South Pacific would have been liable to pay said unregistered electric consumption.<br><br>Subsequently, Meralco sent the corresponding demand letters to South Pacific for the payment of the adjusted bills totaling P1,572,346.85, covering the period from April 1981 to April 1984, under threat of disconnection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>On August 15, 1984, Meralco sent South Pacific a letter demanding the payment of the sum of P1,338,727.77 under threat of termination of all service contracts and disconnection of all power supply to South Pacific's premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; On August 23, 1984, South Pacific filed a petition for prohibition with the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, Branch 171 docketed as Civil Case No. 2099-V-84. It alleged that irreparable damage to both its business and reputation, as well as immeasurable injury to its more than 1,500 employees, would result if Meralco was allowed to terminate its services and disconnect power supply to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;<br><br>The trial court rendered a decision dated February 10, 1995 dismissing South Pacific's petition and awarding to Meralco the sum of P1,174,190.91 on its counterclaim, plus P25,000 as attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>South Pacific filed a motion for reconsideration while Meralco filed a motion for partial reconsideration (and to amend to conform to evidence).&nbsp; In an order dated January 31, 1996, the trial court denied both motions for reconsideration but granted the motion to amend of Meralco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp;<br><br>Thus, in an amended decision dated February 8, 1996, the trial court reiterated its ruling dismissing South Pacific's petition but increasing the award on Meralco's counterclaims to P6,199,393.02.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Both parties appealed the amended decision.<br><br>On July 28, 2000, the CA rendered a decision not only affirming the amended decision but also awarding exemplary damages to Meralco in the amount of P100,000.<br><br>In this petition before us, South Pacific raises the following grounds in support of its petition:<blockquote><table style="border-collapse: collapse; text-align: justify;" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>4.1</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>THE FINDINGS OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>4.2</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>MERALCO MISERABLY FAILED TO JUSTIFY ITS ADJUSTED BILLINGS AGAINST SOUTH PACIFIC.</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td> <br></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td> <br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>4.3</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>THERE WAS NO LEGAL BASIS FOR THE AWARD OF EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>It prays that the CA's decision be reversed and set aside and that its petition for prohibition be granted.<br><br>Meralco, on the other hand, filed its petition on this sole ground:<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT'S RULING THAT THERE WAS NO FACTUAL AND LEGAL BASIS TO HOLD SOUTH PACIFIC LIABLE FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL BILLINGS AMOUNTING TO P397,155.94 AS A RESULT OF THE TAMPERING DISCOVERED ON 17 JUNE 1981 (ACCOUNT NO. 9487-4712), 16 JANUARY 1982 (ACCOUNT NO. 9487-4922-18), 13 APRIL 1981 (ACCOUNT NO. 9487-9012 [OLD]), 21 NOVEMBER 1983 (ACCOUNT NO. 9487-9022-16 [NEW]) AND 13 APRIL 1981 (ACCOUNT NO. 9487-[9212-16]).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>It prays that South Pacific be also held liable for the amount of P397,155.94, with interest thereon at the legal rate commencing from the date of demand on August 15, 1984 until the amount is fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It is obvious that both parties want this Court to revisit the factual findings of the lower courts.&nbsp; Well established is the doctrine that under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law, not of fact, may be raised before the Supreme Court. It must be stressed that this Court is not a trier of facts and it is not its function to re-examine and weigh anew the respective evidence of the parties. Factual findings of the trial court, especially those affirmed by the CA, are conclusive on this Court when supported by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; While this Court has recognized several exceptions to this rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> none of these exceptions applies here.<br><br>Both the trial court and the CA found that South Pacific was liable for the unregistered electric power consumption which it failed to pay due to its defective meters' inability to reflect the correct number of kilowatt hours actually used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; As held by the CA:<blockquote>Contrary to South Pacific's contention that the award of P6,199,393.02 in favor of Meralco was not supported by evidence, We believe, however, that the latter is entitled to said amount.&nbsp; The lower court, in its assailed Decisions, was able to arrive at its own computation based on the figures submitted by Meralco which South Pacific failed to refute.&nbsp; These figures were apparently arrived at based on the findings during routine inspections, laboratory tests and computations made by Meralco in accordance with the stipulation in the service contracts providing that in the event any meter fails to register the full amount of energy consumed, "the Customer shall be billed for such period on an estimated consumption based upon his use of energy in a similar period of like use."&nbsp; There was nothing irregular in the manner that Meralco was able to come up with the adjusted billings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>We see no reason to disturb these findings.<br><br>Both the trial court and the CA also found that Meralco was not entitled to the differential billings in the total amount of P397,155.94:<blockquote>xxx However, the Court is at a loss how [Meralco] arrived at the computation of the differential bills under Account No. 9487-4712-12 in the amount of P12,288.97 as a result of the June 17, 1981 inspection;&nbsp; the amount of P121,470.90 on January 16, 1982 inspection of Account No. 9487-4922-18; the amount of P73,496.33 on April 13, 1981 inspection of Account No. 9498-9012-18 (old);&nbsp; the amount of P62,695.72 on November 21, 1983 inspection of Account No. 9487-9022-16 (New) and the amount of P127,204.02 on April 13, 1981 inspection of Account No. 9487-9212-16.&nbsp; The date or period when the computation of differential billings as the result of the inspections conducted on June 17, 1981 of Account No. 9487-4712-12; the inspection on January 16, 1982 of Account No. 9487-4922-18; the inspection on April 13, 1981 of Account No. 9498-90<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1]</span>2-18 (old); the inspection on November 21, 1983 of Account No. 9487-9022-16 (New) and the inspection on April 13, 1981 of Account No. 9487-9212-16 started and the reasons thereof [were] not clearly and convincingly given/explained by [Meralco].&nbsp; There is no clear and positive evidence of the exact date prior to the inspection conducted on June 17, 1981, January 16, 1982, April 13, 1981, November 21, 1983 and April 13, 1981 of the respective accounts numbers when the meters failed to register the actual electric consumption of [South Pacific].&nbsp; There is no convincing proof when [South Pacific] started to benefit out of the unregistered electric energy.&nbsp; The abnormally low registration in the meters could have been caused by other factors and not a conclusive proof/result of the tampered condition of the meter or metering facilities.&nbsp; The Court is of the considered view that [South Pacific] should not be held liable to pay the differential bills corresponding to the said periods in the total amount of P397,155.94.&nbsp; The said adjusted billings appeared to be without factual and legal basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>No compelling reason has been shown by Meralco for this Court to disturb and reverse the trial court's findings and conclusions, as affirmed by the CA.<br><br>Likewise, the award of exemplary damages to Meralco must be sustained.&nbsp; The CA granted exemplary damages because South Pacific acted in a fraudulent manner:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><blockquote>On numerous occasions, and while in the presence of South Pacific's officers, Meralco agents were able to discover that the former had been using a removable short circuiting device as indicated by the pricked holes on the secondary current leads for lower and upper element near the [bushing current transformer or] BCT terminal.&nbsp; Further inspection revealed that the [BCT] terminal, main terminal and cover seals of the electric meters were deformed.&nbsp; This meant that the electric meters concerned were not registering the full amount of electric energy actually being used by the former. These, among other instances, point to South Pacific's culpability. It would seem inconceivable for all the four electric meters inside South Pacific's premises to be in such a defective condition even without any deliberate act on its part.&nbsp; The evidence in the case at bar affords a substantial basis of fact to justify a conclusion that South Pacific must be held responsible for the tampered meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>Again, fraud is a question of fact which must be alleged and proved at the level of the courts below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Fraud cannot be presumed and must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; We agree with the CA that it was incredible that not just one but all four meters in South Pacific's premises would, at the same time, fail to completely register the amount of energy consumed.&nbsp; South Pacific's full physical control of these meters clearly enabled it to tamper with them and this undeniably redounded to its benefit.<br><br>Lastly, we also affirm the award for attorney's fees, considering the exemplary damages granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, both petitions are hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
