Thus, petitioner sought to foreclose the mortgages  extrajudicially.<br><br>On February 28, 2001, respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 56, Mandaue City, a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for Declaratory Relief, Injunction, Damages, Annulment of Promissory Notes, Documents, and  Contracts against petitioner, docketed as Civil Case No. MAN-4045.  The complaint alleges that prior to 1998, respondents obtained credit accommodations from petitioner.  The latter required respondents' representatives to sign "standard pre-printed bank forms in fine print, such as Credit Line Agreements (CLA), Promissory Notes (PN), Real Estate Mortgages (REM), Chattel Mortgages (CM), Trust Receipts (TR), Surety Agreements (JSS) and other bank forms and documents."  Respondents complied since they trusted petitioner.  However, it tuned out that petitioner's employees filled the blanks with "false and inaccurate entries."  Respondents deny and dispute the genuineness and due execution of the documents and pray for the following reliefs:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div align="justify"><ol><li>Immediately upon filing, to issue <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> a 72-hour temporary restraining order and thereafter upon summary hearing, to issue a temporary     restraining order for a maximum period of twenty (20) days restraining and enjoining defendants, their agents, representatives or any other persons acting on their behalf from doing or proceeding with the following:<br><br>a) proceeding with the auction sale of the properties under the REMs, <br>b) execution of Certificate of Sale;<br> c) registering Certificate of Sale with the Registry of Deeds; <br>d) execution of the Deed of Final Sale and other consolidation documents; <br>e) publication of Notices of Sale; <br>f) posting of Notices of Sale;<br>g) using the questioned documents, like the TRs, to seek administrative, civil, or criminal remedies;<br>h) disturbing the status quo prior to the litigation.<br><br></li><li>After due notice and hearing, a Preliminary Injunction be issued upon posting of a bond enjoining defendant, its employees, agents, representatives, or any other persons acting on its behalf from doing the above acts complained against;<br><br></li><li>After trial, it is prayed that judgment be rendered in favor of plaintiffs and <br>         against defendant as follows:</li></ol></div></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Declaring null and void the CLA, REMs, CMs, PNs, JSS, TRs, and other related documents, the notices of sale, the entire foreclosure proceedings, including the auction sale, the amount claimed by the bank to be the outstanding account, the amount claimed by the bank to be the principal, the interest unilaterally imposed by the bank, the penalties imposed by the bank and the PNs made basis for default and foreclosure;<br><br>b) Declaring the CLA, REMs, CMs, PNs, JSS, TRs, and other related documents as without consideration, invalid, inoperative, ineffective, unenforceable, null and void and to cancel the same;<br><br>c) To make the injunction permanent;<br><br>d) To order the bank to comply with its commitments, assurances and representations to help in the rehabilitation of the Dacay Group and the restructuring of its obligations, if any;<br><br>e) To award to plaintiffs moral damages of P300,000.00, exemplary damages of P200,000.00, attorney's fees of P200,000.00 plus P1,000.00 per billable hour, and litigation expenses of P300,000.00;<br><br>f) Declaring that the defendant cannot validly do, perform or suffer to be done the acts complained of.<br></div><br></div>On March 9, 2001, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5] </sup>granting respondents' prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), thus:<br><br>In resolving the petition for the issuance of a TRO the court, without going into the merits of the case has taken into consideration:<br><blockquote>a) the fact that petitioners/plaintiffs are presently in the process of rehabilitating their business concerns and for which purpose, a consortium of banks/creditors has been put into existence and that Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) even had initially approved and led such effort as indicated by the participation of one of its Senior Vice Presidents Ricardo G.

In fact, defendant's annexes to its answer (Annex "I" and "L") admit that plaintiffs' business address and principal place of business are at Pakna-an, Mandaue City.

Nowhere in the complaint in Civil Case No. MAN-4045 did respondents allege the assessed values of their realties.  Hence, there is no adequate basis for computing the proper filing fees.  It necessarily follows that the fees paid are deficient.  The trial court, therefore, did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.  <br><br>Respondents counter that a perusal of the complaint in Civil Case No. MAN-4045 shows that the suit primarily involves cancellation of mortgages, an action incapable of pecuniary estimation.  Consequently, petitioner's contention that there is a deficiency in the payment of docket fees is without merit.<br><br>A court acquires jurisdiction over a case only upon the payment of the prescribed fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>   The importance of filing fees cannot be gainsaid for these are intended to take care of court expenses in the handling of cases in terms of costs of supplies, use of equipment, salaries and fringe benefits of personnel, and others, computed as to man-hours used in the handling of each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>  Hence, the non-payment or insufficient payment of docket fees can entail tremendous losses to the government in general and to the judiciary in particular.<br><br>Is an action for cancellation of mortgage incapable of pecuniary estimation?<br><br>Under Section 19 (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 180, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691, Regional Trial Courts have sole, exclusive, and original jurisdiction to hear, try, and decide "all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation."  <br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Singsong v. Isabela Sawmill</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this Court laid the test for determining whether the subject matter of an action is incapable of pecuniary estimation, thus:  Ascertain the nature of the principal action or remedy sought.  If the action is primarily for recovery of a sum of money, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary estimation.  Whether the trial court has jurisdiction would depend upon the amount of the claim. <span style="font-weight: bold;">However, where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, where the money claim is only incidental or a consequence of the principal relief sought, the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation.</span><br><br>Here, the primary reliefs prayed for by respondents in Civil Case    No. MAN-4045 is the cancellation of the real estate and chattel mortgages for want of consideration.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Bumayog v. Tumas,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup> this Court ruled that where the issue involves the validity of a mortgage, the action is one incapable  of  pecuniary estimation.  In the more recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Russell v. Vestil,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><sup> </sup> this Court, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Bumayog</span>,<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</span> </sup> held that an action questioning the validity of a mortgage is one incapable of pecuniary estimation. Petitioner has not shown adequate reasons for this Court to revisit <span style="font-style: italic;">Bumayog </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Russell</span>.  Hence, petitioner's contention can not be sustained.   Since respondents paid the docket fees, as computed by the clerk of court, consequently, the trial court acquired jurisdiction over Civil Case No. MAN-4045.<br><br>Concerning to the <span style="font-style: italic;">second issue</span>, it should be noted that CA-G.R. SP No. 67270 is a petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus alleging that the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the following Orders:  (1) Order dated March 9, 2001 granting respondents' prayer for a TRO; (2) Order dated March 27, 2001, directing the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction; (3) Order also dated March 27, 2001 denying petitioner's motion to dismiss; and (4) Order dated August 16, 2001 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration of the grant of preliminary injunction.  <br><br>This Court holds that the Court of Appeals did not commit grave abuse of discretion in issuing the questioned Orders.<br><br>There is grave abuse of discretion where the acts complained of amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reasons of passion or personal hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  It is such whimsical and capricious exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.  <br><br>The Court of Appeals found that the trial court acted in fair, reasonable, and expeditious manner, thus:<br><blockquote><div align="justify">Thus, on the 6th of March 2001, His Honor held a hearing on the application for temporary restraining order. He conducted at least three trial-type hearings on the 19th, 20th, and 23rd of March 2001, complete with direct examination, cross-examination, re-direct examination, re-cross examination and marking and offer of exhibits vis-á-vis the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Four witnesses testified during the hearings – two for the Dacay Group and two for the bank. Both parties were even required to submit memoranda.<br></div></blockquote>Indeed, the records are bereft of any indication that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the challenged Orders.  Verily, the Court of Appeals correctly held that certiorari will not lie, the sole office of the writ being to correct grave abuse of discretion.  Where a court has jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the action, as in the instant case, its decisions on all questions arising from the case are but exercises of such jurisdiction.<sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</span>  </sup> If its findings are not correct, these would at best be questions of law, not abuse of discretion correctible by the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE, </span>this Court <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIES</span> the petition.
