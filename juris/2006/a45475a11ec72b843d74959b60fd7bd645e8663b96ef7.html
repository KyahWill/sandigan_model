Appended to the letter were proposals on revisions of the previous CBA, which included wage and bonus increase, welfare allowances and hospitalization incentives, transportation, uniform, and rice subsidy augmentation. The Union also proposed the amendment of the existing retirement program of the Corporation for its employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The Corporation did not respond to the letter. Consequently, the proposed conference failed to materialize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; On March 9, 2004, Diaz issued a Memorandum informing all employees that a comprehensive cost reduction program would be implemented by the Corporation on April 15, 2004, "on account of depressed business conditions brought about by the currency crisis in Southeast Asia, the Middle East war and the 9/11 incident in the United States of America." According to the Memorandum, the employees concerned would receive the following benefits:<br><blockquote>a) Separation pay<br>b) Cash equivalent of earned but unused vacation and sick leave credits<br>c) Pro-rata 13<sup>th</sup> month pay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Of the 88 employees who were terminated from employment, 77 were Union members,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> including Edgardo Villanueva, who was elected Union officer after the personnel reduction program commenced. The 14 Union members who were retrenched received their separation pay and other benefits from the Corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In a letter dated March 11, 2004, Diaz informed the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) of its retrenchment program, which was being implemented "on account of a slump in the demand of its products due to their uncompetitiveness compared to similar products made elsewhere in Asia where cost of labor is very low." According to the letter, the Corporation decided to retrench its personnel to save production costs and to stay in business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The Corporation submitted the list of 88 employees who were to be retrenched effective at the close of working hours on or about April 15, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated March 18, 2004 signed by Rafael G. Villareal, Acting Assistant General Manager, the Corporation proposed a moratorium on wage increase and additional benefits, considering that business, especially the export manufacturing sector, had been hard hit by "a series of externally generated factors."&nbsp; It was pointed out that the prices of the Corporation's products remained uncompetitive compared to those of China, Thailand, and Indonesia, and this drove prospective buyers away.&nbsp; The Corporation was also confronted with stiff competition coming from traders who brought in smuggled goods and the fact that the market trend had shifted to cheap foreign-produced carpet rolls.&nbsp; The letter also stressed that the car carpet industry profits were predominantly marginal due to competition and customer requirements.<br><br>The letter further stated that the Philippine economy in general was in crisis, and that the biggest problem of all was the uncertainty of the country's political and economic future. Consequently, the volume of business generated by the Corporation had steadily declined from 2000 to 2003, such that workers were forced to avail of their leaves as there was not enough workload.&nbsp; The Corporation's objective was to keep the business viable by rationalizing manpower and reducing production and labor cost, including the implementation of the voluntary retirement program.&nbsp; The Corporation anticipated a prolonged demand slowdown and it was surmised that, based on reasonable projections, the business would remain at a standstill with no improvement until after two or three years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, given these circumstances, the only way to survive the crisis was for the Union to agree on a moratorium on increase in wages and benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Frustrated at the Corporation's response, the Union filed a notice of strike with the DOLE on the same day.&nbsp; Negotiations before the National Conciliation and Mediation Board ensued,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> but the Corporation stood pat on its stance for a moratorium on increases in wages and benefits.&nbsp; The Union rejected this and accused the Corporation of union busting, as 77 of its members were dismissed.<br><br>On March 31, 2004, the Union filed a petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> with the DOLE for the Secretary of Labor and Employment (SOLE) to assume jurisdiction over the labor dispute involving the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>ECONOMIC ISSUES<br><ol><li>Wage Increase</li><li>Benefits<br>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Uniform<br>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; HMO (Hospitalization Assistance)<br>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Christmas Bonus<br>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Rice Subsidy<br>2.5&nbsp;&nbsp; Early Retirement<br><br></li></ol></li><li>NON-ECONOMIC ISSUES<br><ol><li>Scope of the Bargaining Unit<br><br></li></ol></li><li>UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE<br><ol><li>Illegal dismissal of 76 union members;</li><li>CBA violation; and</li><li>Refusal to bargain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>In its Position Paper, the Union alleged that its proposed CBA package for three years (2004 to 2007) would amount only to P35,890,500.00, or an average of P11,963,500.00 per CBA year, hardly a dent on the Corporation's accumulated net profit of P213,858,402.00 for the last six years (1998 to 2003).&nbsp; It was pointed out that the Corporation earned a net income of P39,553,028.00 in 2002, and P12,729,776.00 in 2003.&nbsp; The Union claimed that there was no valid economic reason to retrench employees, and that a "slump" in demand of the Corporation's products was not a valid ground to dismiss employees.&nbsp; The Union also charged the Corporation of resorting to a sinister scheme of re-channeling its carpet business to its wholly owned subsidiary, PCMC-Clark, while negotiations for a new CBA were ongoing.&nbsp; According to the Union, this was also to justify the dismissal of the 77 Union members and bust the Union in the process. The Union insisted that the Corporation was guilty of unfair labor practice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The Union maintained that in dismissing its employees, the Corporation violated the mandatory 30-day notice rule because such employees received the notice of termination on March 13, 2004 (Saturday), to take effect the following working day, March 15, 2004 (Monday).&nbsp; It stressed that the 30-day mandatory notice could not be substituted by paying the affected employees their respective one month salaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>For its part, the Corporation alleged that based on the documents submitted to the SOLE, it suffered a sharp decline in business in terms of volume and income derived since 2001, caused by the Asian financial crisis and later aggravated by the 9/11 incident in the U.S. and the ongoing war in the Middle East.&nbsp; This was aggravated by higher production and labor costs as compared to its competitors in China, Thailand, and Indonesia; as such, the net incomes of the Corporation drastically declined from 2000 to 2003, as follows:<br><blockquote>2000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; P41,905,721.00<br>2001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; P32,903,800.00<br>2002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P27,661,213.00<br>2003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P11,122,142.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The Corporation went on to explain that its income from the domestic market and export operations declined sharply: from its export operations, its income of P28,855,000.00 in 2001 dropped to P23,927,000.00 in 2002; and, thereafter, to P5,796,000.00 in 2003.&nbsp; From its domestic operations, it had a net loss of P1,406,000.00 in 2001 which increased to P7,363,000.00 in 2002, and to P6,605,000.00 in 2003.&nbsp; The sharp decline in export sales and income in 2003 was due to the fact that it lost 16 of its clients in the Middle East, costing the Corporation a total of US$4,668,908.28 in unrealized sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; It also lost 70 of its domestic clients to its competitors, resulting in unrealized sales of P69,866,638.67.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; Due to the lack of orders, the volume of business was drastically reduced, as shown in the workload of the Corporation as of April 2004:<br><blockquote>x x x the workload for PPC was good for only 8 days; for Spinning, 40 days; for Dyeing, 2 days; for Graphic Arts, 8 days; for Stenciling, 15 days; for Weaving, 8 days; for Sample, 3 days; for Pass Machine, 1 day; and for Car Carpet, 16 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Aside from the 88 affected employees, even managerial and supervisory employees were not spared, as six of them were also retrenched.&nbsp; Seventeen Union members had accepted their separation pay and other benefits, and as to the remaining employees, the Corporation averred that they received the following, aside from productivity incentive bonuses:&nbsp;&nbsp;

P22,820,151.00 in 2004; P29,274,211.00 in 2005; and P26,924,602.00 in 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The SOLE also ruled that the Corporation was not guilty of union-busting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The Union thereafter filed a petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>with the Court of Appeals (CA), assailing the decision of the SOLE on the following grounds:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE HON.

National Labor Relations Commission</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the CA declared that while low volume of work and completion of project alone did not justify dismissal under the Labor Code, if accompanied by evidence which show that certain positions had become redundant, employees could be validly dismissed on such ground.&nbsp; The CA also declared that a position is redundant when it is superfluous, and may be caused by decrease in volume of business.&nbsp; It emphasized that what determines the validity of the dismissal based on redundancy is the sufficiency of evidence showing the superfluity of the position and the substantial compliance with the procedure laid down under the aforesaid article.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The appellate court declared that while the corporation hired employees after the retrenchment, the new workers were hired for fixed periods only.&nbsp; The Corporation had been hiring workers for fixed periods and "on a need basis" even before the retrenchment program was implemented.&nbsp; The CA observed that it even engaged the services of independent contractors to perform carpet installation work to augment its personnel complement.&nbsp; Thus, contrary to the position of the Union, the hiring of workers for a fixed period was not intended to fill up the positions left by the retrenched 77 Union members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The CA also ruled that the Memorandum announcing the retrenchment to the employees was circulated on March 9, 2004.&nbsp; It was even followed by individual notices of termination on March 13, 2004 indicating that the intended termination would take effect only on April 15, 2004.&nbsp; Hence, the employees were given prior notices, more than one month before the intended termination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Union filed a motion for reconsideration, which the appellate court denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Thus, petitioner Union seeks relief from this Court, alleging that the CA erred in affirming the dismissal of its Union members on the ground of retrenchment or redundancy, and in dismissing its complaint for unfair labor practice against respondent Corporation.<br><br>Petitioner avers that there was no factual basis for the dismissal of 77 of its members due to retrenchment or redundancy.&nbsp; Contrary to the findings of the CA that there was a "slump" in demand for respondent's products and a decrease in volume of business and profits, net sales increased to P504,580,259.00, gross profit to P145,507,002.00, and net profit to P48,193,416.00 in 2004.&nbsp; Petitioner relies on the annual audited report of respondent Corporation filed with the SEC on April 15, 2005.&nbsp; Such claim of a slump in product demand is likewise belied by the following: hiring or rehiring 100 new employees, mass promotions of 12 managerial and supervisory employees, contracting janitorial services, and authorizing full blast overtime work for 6 hours every day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner posits that respondent Corporation transferred most of the jobs of the 77 dismissed Union members to its subsidiary, the PCMC-Clark, to justify the mass dismissal.&nbsp; Petitioner insists that respondent Corporation should not be allowed to evade its liabilities for unfair labor practices and hide behind the cloak of the separate corporate entity of its wholly-owned subsidiary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that respondent Corporation violated Section 3(e), Article IV of the CBA by dismissing Edgardo Villanueva, an elected senior officer.&nbsp; Moreover, in effecting the dismissal of its 77 members, respondent Corporation violated the 30-day mandatory notice rule under the existing CBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>By way of Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> respondent Corporation avers that the issues raised by petitioner are factual, and under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, such issues are proscribed.&nbsp; It insists that the evidence relied on by petitioner in its Manifestation dated May 30, 2005 was irrelevant, relating as it does to its financial status and those of its subsidiaries known as "The Group." It further asserts that some managers and supervisors were promoted in the ordinary course of personnel movement based on merits. It reiterates that the services of the 77 Union members were terminated due to redundancy, a result of a radical reduction in volume of business, and implemented in the legitimate exercise of its management prerogative.&nbsp; Respondent Corporation cites the ruling of the SOLE as basis to reject petitioner's plea to pierce the separate corporate entity of the PCMC-Clark and find respondent guilty of union busting.<br><br>In reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> petitioner avers that the documents appended to its Manifestation dated May 30, 2005 before the CA pertained to respondent Corporation, and were filed with the SEC on April 15, 2005.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Retrenchment is an authorized cause for the termination of employment under Article 283 of the Labor Code, which reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 283.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel</span>. – The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the <span style="font-style: italic;">installation of labor saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment</span> or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof.&nbsp; In case of termination due to the installation of labor saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.&nbsp; In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.&nbsp; A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Retrenchment is defined as the termination of employment initiated by the employer through no fault of the employee and without prejudice to the latter, resorted by management during periods of business recession, industrial depression or seasonal fluctuations or during lulls over shortage of materials.&nbsp; It is a reduction in manpower, a measure utilized by an employer to minimize business losses incurred in the operation of its business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Explaining the import of the phrase "to prevent losses," this Court held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>In its ordinary connotation, the phrase "to prevent losses" means that retrenchment or termination of the services of some employees is authorized to be undertaken by the employer <span style="font-style: italic;">sometime before </span>the losses anticipated are actually sustained or realized.&nbsp; It is not, in other words, the intention of the lawmaker to compel the employer to stay his hand and keep all his employees until sometime after losses shall have, in fact, materialized; if such an intent were expressly written into the law, that law may well be vulnerable to constitutional attack as taking property from one man to give to another.&nbsp; This is simple enough.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>The prerogative of an employer to retrench its employees must be exercised only as a last resort, considering that it will lead to the loss of the employees' livelihood.&nbsp; It is justified only when all other less drastic means have been tried and found insufficient or inadequate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Moreover, the employer must prove the requirements for a valid retrenchment by clear and convincing evidence; otherwise, said ground for termination would be susceptible to abuse by scheming employers who might be merely feigning losses or reverses in their business ventures in order to ease out employees.&nbsp; The requirements are:<br><blockquote>xxx (1) that the retrenchment is reasonably necessary and likely to prevent business losses which, if already incurred, are not merely <span style="font-style: italic;">de minimis</span>, but substantial, serious, actual and real, or if only expected, are reasonably imminent as perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer; (2) that the employer served written notice both to the employees and to the Department of Labor and Employment at least one month prior to the intended date of retrenchment; (3) that the employer pays the retrenched employees separation pay equivalent to one month pay or at least ½ month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; (4) that the employer exercises its prerogative to retrench employees in good faith for the advancement of its interest and not to defeat or circumvent the employees' right to security of tenure; and (5) that the employer used fair and reasonable criteria in ascertaining who would be dismissed and who would be retained among the employees, such as status (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., whether they are temporary, casual, regular or managerial employees), efficiency, seniority, physical fitness, age, and financial hardship for certain workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>What the law speaks of is serious business losses or financial reverses.&nbsp; Sliding incomes or decreasing gross revenues are not necessarily losses, much less serious business losses within the meaning of the law.&nbsp; The bare fact that an employer may have sustained a net loss, such loss,<span style="font-style: italic;"> per se</span>, absent any other evidence on its impact on the business, nor on expected losses that would have been incurred had operations been continued, may not amount to serious business losses mentioned in the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; The employer must also show that its losses increased through a period of time and that the condition of the company will not likely improve in the near future.<br><br>Redundancy, on the other hand, exists when the service capability of the work force is in excess of what is reasonably needed to meet the demands of the enterprise.&nbsp; A redundant position is one rendered superfluous by any number of factors, such as overhiring of workers, decreased volume of business, dropping of a particular product line previously manufactured by the company, or phasing out of a service activity previously undertaken by the business.&nbsp;

Cash dividends were likewise declared on March 29, 2004, barely two weeks after it implemented its "retrenchment program."<br><br>If respondent Corporation were to be believed that it had to retrench employees due to the debilitating slump in demand for its products resulting in severe losses, how could it justify the purchase of P20,000,000.00 worth of machinery and equipment?&nbsp; There is likewise no justification for the hiring of more than 100 new employees, more than the number of those who were retrenched, as well as the order authorizing full blast overtime work for six hours daily.&nbsp; All these are inconsistent with the intransigent claim that respondent Corporation was impelled to retrench its employees precisely because of low demand for its products and other external causes.<br><br>The evidence on record also shows that from 1999 to 2003, respondent Corporation had the following net sales, gross and net profits, as well as net income:<br>&nbsp;
