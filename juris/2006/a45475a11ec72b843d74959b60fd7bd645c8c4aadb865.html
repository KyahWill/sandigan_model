Petitioner asserts that it is the Sandiganbayan, not the RTC, which has jurisdiction over this "ill-gotten wealth" case because the complaint involved the annulment of a fraudulent conveyance of government property to a Marcos crony and the recovery of such "ill-gotten wealth" by the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup>Furthermore, for failure to consolidate this civil case with the criminal case in the Sandiganbayan [charging petitioner with violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019], this case should be considered abandoned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  <br><br>Petitioner's contention has no merit. <br><br>Petitioner argued and discussed this particular issue for the first time in his memorandum before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> While it is true that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case may be raised at any stage of the proceedings since it is conferred by law, it is nevertheless settled that a party may be barred from raising it on the ground of estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> After voluntarily submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is improper and too late for the losing party to question the jurisdiction of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> A party who has invoked the jurisdiction of a court over a particular matter to secure affirmative relief cannot be permitted to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  Thus petitioner is estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the courts below.<br><br>Now, the merits of the petition.<br><br>We agree with the conclusion of the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and the RTC that the second contract was null and void<span style="font-style: italic;"> ab initio. </span><br><br>The second contract was null and void <span style="font-style: italic;">ab initio</span> for being in contravention of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019, otherwise known as the "Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Both the trial and appellate courts found that the second contract gave petitioner unwarranted benefits and was grossly disadvantageous to the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Under Article 1409(7) of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the contract was null and void from the beginning.<br><br>We quote the discussion of the CA with approval: <br><blockquote>The inquiry that must be settled is – Whether or not the subject Agreement had been grossly disadvantageous to the economic interests of the Republic.<br><br>xxx                               xxx                               xxx<br><br>x x x prior to the subject Agreement, there was a subsisting lease-purchase Agreement between GSIS and the Republic, thru the OGCC, whereby the latter undertakes to pay the former the total amount of [P1,500,000], payable within [15] years and the payment of the yearly amortization of [P100,000] shall be made in equal quarterly installments of [P25,000]. Under the same Agreement, the Republic, thru the OGCC shall manage and administer the leased premises as if it were the absolute owner thereof. As of August 1982, the Republic, thru the OGCC had been collecting an average monthly rental of [P10,000] from [various tenants of the premises].<br><br>The foregoing figures [leads] to the conclusion that the Republic, thru the OGCC, had been earning an average annual rental income of [P120,000], an amount which is more than enough to cover its yearly amortization-rental to the GSIS which is only [P100,000].<br><br>The economic benefit which the Republic, thru the OGCC, enjoys during the subsistence of the prior Agreement is shown by its being able to liquidate its yearly amortization-rental from the rental income of the subject property without any need for the Republic to appropriate additional funds for such disbursement and further, by the transfer of absolute ownership of the subject property to the Republic, thru the OGCC, at the termination of the [15] year lease-purchase Agreement.<br><br>In the subject Agreement with [petitioner], the consideration was increased to [P2,000,000] with a down payment of [P200,000] and the balance payable within a period of [15] years at [12%] per annum interest thereon, compounded yearly, with a yearly amortization of [P264,278.37], including principal and interest. Under the same Agreement, the OGCC was likewise allowed to continue occupying its offices from the second to the fifth floors of the premises, at the rental rate of [P100,000] annually.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Agreement between [petitioner] and the GSIS which is the subject of the instant case had in fact transferred the economic benefits which the Republic used to enjoy to [petitioner]. </span>At the end of [15] years, [petitioner] shall become the absolute owner of the subject property upon full payment of the [15] yearly amortizations. At bottom, however, is the fact that, at least for the first [five] years of the [Agreement], [petitioner] shall not be shelling out of his own pocket the yearly amortization since the same shall be covered by the annual rental coming from the OGCC and the other tenants thereof. In the meantime, the Republic, thru the OGCC, shall not only be appropriating additional funds for its annual rental but worse, it was stripped of the opportunity to become the absolute owner of the subject property.<br><br>The Court cannot also ignore the marked differences between the consideration of TWO MILLION PESOS (P2,000,000.00) and the valuations of the subject property in 1982 as appraised by Mr. Narlito Mari'o to the effect that the fair market value of the subject property from FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,575,000.00) as the minimum and SEVEN MILLION EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED PESOS (P7,083,300.00) as the maximum and Cuervo Appraisers, Inc. to the effect that the fair market value of the subject property is EIGHT MILLION FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PESOS (P8,005,500.00). While concededly the foregoing property appraisal was conducted in 1989 and 1996 respectively, the Court is not unmindful of the fact that the valuations were arrived at by taking into consideration all the parameters that, by practice, could provide reasonable statistical indication of the value of the subject property in 1982.<br><br>On this respect, [respondents'] assertion that the subject Agreement is at the behest of [petitioner] and is grossly disadvantageous to the Republic had become self-evident since it certainly bewilders the mind why the GSIS would enter into an Agreement which smacks of disturbing economic implications, i.e. <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Republic would need to appropriate additional funds to pay for its rentals and abandon the chance of becoming the owner of the subject property which it uses for governmental purposes </span>and the fact that the subject property was negotiated by the government via a losing proposition.<br><br>xxx                               xxx                               xxx<br><br>... [I]n view of GSIS' undertaking to construct another building for the OGCC ... what was revealed is the fact that if only to accommodate the subject Agreement with the [petitioner], the GSIS had undertaken to build another building for the OGCC or to make available for OGCC's use any other acquired property and to grant the same terms and conditions as that of the previous agreement.  Necessarily so, the GSIS had imposed additional economic burden upon itself, at the expense of government funds, in order to meet the terms and conditions of the subject Agreement when the same was not necessary during the subsistence of the prior agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30] </sup>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The foregoing clearly shows that the second contract caused undue injury to the government, gave petitioner unwarranted benefits and was grossly disadvantageous to the government. The disquisition of the CA is sufficiently exhaustive and convincing considering that in civil cases like this one, the party with the burden of proof  (in this case, the respondents) needs only to establish its case by a preponderance of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31] </sup> <br><br>The act of entering into the second contract was a corrupt practice and was therefore unlawful. It was a contract expressly prohibited by RA 3019. As a result, it was null and void from the beginning under Art. 1409(7) of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>As for the forfeiture of the payments made by petitioner, the latter did not raise any substantial argument against it.  He merely stated that "there should be no reason why the amounts paid by petitioner should be forfeited in favor of the Republic" since the property was owned by GSIS and the Republic, through the OGCC, was merely a lessee. <br><br>The RTC decision was clear. The amount forfeited was in favor of GSIS as owner of the property.  <br><br>Having disposed of the main issue and ruling that the second contract was void ab initio for being prohibited by law, a discussion of the other ancillary issues raised by petitioner is no longer necessary.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span> and the June 27, 2003 decision and November 10, 2003 resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

It is clear under the law of contracts that vitiation of consent does not make a contract null and void<span style="font-style: italic;"> ab initio.</span>  It merely results in a voidable contract.  We declared this in <span style="font-style: italic;">MWSS v. CA</span> (357 Phil. 966, 978-979 [1998]):<br><blockquote>As noted by both lower courts, petitioner MWSS admits that it consented to the sale of the property, with the qualification that such consent was allegedly unduly influenced by the President Marcos. Taking such allegation to be hypothetically true, such would have resulted in only voidable contracts because all three elements of a contract, still obtained nonetheless. The alleged vitiation of MWSS' consent did not make the sale null and void ab initio. Thus, "a contract where consent is given through mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud, is voidable."  Contracts "where consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud" are voidable or annullable. These are not void as '<br><blockquote>"Concepts of Voidable Contracts. — Voidable or anullable contracts are existent, valid, and binding, although they can be annulled because of want of capacity or vitiated consent of the one of the parties, but before annulment, they are effective and obligatory between parties. Hence, it is valid until it is set aside and its validity may be assailed only in an action for that purpose.

Philippine Ports Authority</span> (G.R. L-75197, 22 June 1987, 151 SCRA 233). We held in that case that the management contract executed by and between E. Razon, Inc. and PPA, represented by its then General Manager. E.S. Baclig, Jr. on June 27, 1980 was null and void. At the time of the execution of the management contract, E. Razon, Inc. later known as Metro Port Services, Inc. was controlled by Alfredo "Bejo" Romualdez, brother-in-law of deposed President Marcos. Under Section 5 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. No. 3019) Romualdez, by reason of his relationship with the then President of the Philippines, was prohibited from intervening, directly or indirectly, in any transaction or business with the government. Thus, the management contract, entered into by E. Razon, Inc. which was controlled by Alfredo Romualdez as 60% equity owner thereof, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">null and void and of no effect, being one expressly prohibited by law (par. [7], Art. 1409, Civil Code of the Philippines).</span></div>
