The second Resolution denied Petitioner Acejas' Motion for New Trial.</p> <p>Hence, petitioners now seek recourse in this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p> <p align="center"><strong><u>The Facts</u></strong></p> <p>The facts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> are narrated by the Sandiganbayan as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"At around 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. of December 17, 1993, accused Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID) Intelligence Agent Vladimir Hernandez, together with a reporter, went to the house of Takao Aoyagi and Bethel Grace Pelingon-Aoyagi at 27 Pacific Drive, Grand Villa, Sto. Niño, Parañaque, Metro Manila. His purpose was to serve Mission Order No. 93-04-12 dated December 13, 1993, issued by BID Commissioner Zafiro Respicio against Takao Aoyagi, a Japanese national. Hernandez told Takao Aoyagi, through his wife, Bethel Grace, that there were complaints against him in Japan and that he was suspected to be a Yakuza big boss, a drug dependent and an overstaying alien.</p> <p>"To prove that he had done nothing wrong, Takao Aoyagi showed his passport to Hernandez who issued an undertaking (Exh. 'B') which Aoyagi signed. The undertaking stated that Takao Aoyagi promised to appear in an investigation at the BID on December 20, 1993, and that as a guarantee for his appearance, he was entrusting his passport to Hernandez. Hernandez acknowledged receipt of the passport.</p> <p>"On December 18, 1993, Bethel Grace Aoyagi called accused Expedito 'Dick' Perlas<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and informed him about the taking of her husband's passport by Hernandez. Perlas told her he would refer their problem to his brother-in-law, Atty. Danton Lucenario of the Lucenario, Margate, Mogpo, Tiongco and Acejas III Law Firm. It was at the Sheraton Hotel that Perlas introduced the Aoyagis to Atty. Lucenario. They discussed the problem and Atty. Lucenario told the Aoyagis not to appear before the BID on December 20, 1993.</p> <p>"As advised by Atty. Lucenario, Takao Aoyagi did not appear before the BID. Instead, Atty. Rufino M. Margate of the Lucenario Law Firm filed with the BID an Entry of Appearance (Exh. '6' – Acejas). Atty. Margate requested for copies of any complaint-affidavit against Takao Aoyagi and asked what the ground was for the confiscation of x x x Aoyagi's passport.</p> <p>"Hernandez prepared a Progress Report (Exh. '5' – Hernandez) which was submitted to Ponciano M. Ortiz, the Chief of Operations and Intelligence Division of the BID. Ortiz recommended that Takao Aoyagi, who was reportedly a Yakuza and a drug dependent, be placed under custodial investigation.</p> <p>"In the evening of December 22, 1993 at the Diamond Hotel, the Aoyagis met accused Atty. Francisco Acejas III who was then accompanied by Perlas. Atty. Acejas informed them that it would be he who would handle their case. A Contract for Legal Services (Exh. 'D') dated December 22, 1993 was entered into by Takao Aoyagi and Atty. Acejas, who represented the Lucenario Law Firm.</p> <p>"In the morning of December 23, 1993, Perlas and Atty. Acejas accompanied the Aoyagis to the Domestic Airport as the latter were going to Davao. It was here that Takao Aoyagi paid Atty. Acejas P40,000.00, P25,000 of which is 50% of the acceptance fee, and the P15,000.00 is for filing/docket fee (Exh. 'O'). The Aoyagis were able to leave only in the afternoon as the morning flight was postponed.</p> <p>"On December 24, 1993, while attending a family reunion, Bethel Grace Pelingon-Aoyagi informed her brother, Filomeno 'Jun' Pelingon, Jr., about her husband's passport.</p> <p>"On January 2, 1994, Jun Pelingon talked to BID Commissioner Zafiro Respicio in Davao and told the latter of Takao Aoyagi's problem with the BID. Respicio gave Pelingon his calling card and told Pelingon to call him up in his office. That same day, Jun Pelingon and Mr. and Mrs. Aoyagi flew back to Manila.</p> <p>"On January 5, 1994, Jun Pelingon, Dick Perlas, Atty. Acejas, Vladimir Hernandez, Vic Conanan and Akira Nemoto met at the Aristocrat Restaurant in Roxas Boulevard.</p> <p>"Another meeting was arranged at the Manila Nikko Hotel in Makati on January 8, 1994 with Jun Pelingon, Perlas, Atty. Acejas and Hernandez attending.</p> <p>"On January 11, 1994, on account of the alleged demand of P1 million for the return of Takao Aoyagi's passport, Jun Pelingon called up Commissioner Respicio. The latter referred him to Atty. Angelica Somera, an NBI Agent detailed at the BID. It was Atty. Carlos Saunar, also of the NBI, and Atty. Somera who arranged the entrapment operation.</p> <p>"On January 12, 1994, Vladimir Hernandez returned the passport to Takao Aoyagi at the Coffee Shop of the Diamond Hotel. The NBI Team headed by Attorneys Saunar and Somera arrested Dick Perlas, Atty. Acejas and Jose Victoriano after the latter picked up the brown envelope containing marked money representing the amount being allegedly demanded. Only Perlas, Acejas and Victoriano were brought to the NBI Headquarters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><em><strong><u>Version of the Prosecution</u></strong></em></p> <p>Testifying for the prosecution were Bethel Grace Pelingon Aoyagi, Filomeno "Jun" Basaca Pelingon, Jr., and Carlos Romero Saunar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> <p>The prosecution evidence showed that it was during a meeting on January 5, 1994, when P1 million as consideration for the passport was demanded. Conanan averred that Aoyagi was a drug trafficker and Yakuza member. The money was to be used to settle the alleged "problem" and to facilitate the processing of a permanent visa. When Pelingon negotiated to lower the amount demanded, Conanan stated that there were many of them in the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p> <p>During the second meeting held at Hotel Nikko, Pelingon was informed that the press and government enforcers were after Aoyagi. Hernandez asked for a partial payment of P300,000, but Pelingon said that the whole amount would be given at just one time to avoid another meeting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p> <p>After talking to Commissioner Respicio on January 11, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Pelingon called up Dick Perlas to schedule the exchange.</p> <p>Regarding the involvement of Petitioner Acejas, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) adds the following facts:</p> <blockquote> <p>"1.2. On 5 January 1994, [Acejas] and Perlas met Pelingon at the Aristocrat Restaurant. [Acejas] informed Pelingon that he would file a P1 million lawsuit against the BID agents who confiscated the passport of Takao Aoyagi. [Acejas] showed Pelingon several papers, which allegedly were in connection with the intended lawsuit. However, when Hernandez and Conanan arrived at the Aristocrat Restaurant, [Acejas] never mentioned to the BID agents the P1 million lawsuit. [Acejas] just hid the papers he earlier showed to Pelingon inside his [Acejas'] bag.</p> <p>"1.3. [Acejas] was present when Hernandez proposed that Takao Aoyagi pay the amount of P1 million in exchange for the help he would extend to him (Takao) in securing a permanent visa in the Philippines. [Acejas], who was Aoyagi's lawyer, did nothing.</p> <p>"1.4. On 10 January 1994, [Acejas], Pelingon, Perlas and Hernandez met at the Hotel Nikko. Thereat, Hernandez informed the group that certain government officials and even the press were after Takao Aoyagi. Hernandez said that Takao Aoyagi can make a partial payment of P300,000.00. Pelingon however, assured the group that Takao Aoyagi would pay in full the amount of P1 million so as not to set another meeting date. [Acejas] kept quiet throughout the negotiations.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>"1.5.a. [Acejas] was present during the entrapment that took place at the Diamond Hotel. Hernandez handed the passport to [Acejas], who handed it then to Perlas and thereafter to Takao Aoyagi. After Takao Aoyagi went over his confiscated passport, Bethel Grace handed to Hernandez the envelope<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> containing the supposed P1 million. Hernandez refused and motioned that [Acejas] be the one to receive it. [Acejas] willingly got the envelope and placed it beside him and Perlas.</p> <p>x x x before Hernandez handed out Aoyagi's passport, he reminded the group of their earlier agreement of <em>'kaliwaan,' i.e.,</em> that after the passport is released, the Aoyagis should give the P1 million."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><em><strong><u>Version of the Defense</u></strong></em></p> <p>Vladimir S. Hernandez, Expedito S. Perlas, Francisco SB. Acejas III, Victor D. Conanan and Ponciano M. Ortiz testified for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> <p>To the Sandiganbayan's narration, Hernandez adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>"6. x x x [Hernandez], an intelligence agent of the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation (BID), went to the house of Private Respondents Takao and Bethel Grace Aoyagi to enforce and serve a Mission Order issued and assigned to him by BID Commissioner Zafiro Respicio on December 13, 1993, for the arrest of Takao Aoyagi.</p> <p>"7. When Bethel Grace showed [Hernandez] her husband's passport, [Hernandez] found out that the latter's [authority] to stay had already been duly extended. He invited private respondents to go with him to the BID office. They declined, but made a written undertaking to appear at the BID office for investigation on December 20, 1993. As security for said undertaking, Bethel Grace Aoyagi entrusted to [Hernandez] her husband's passport, receipt of which [Hernandez], in return, acknowledge[d] in the same instrument.</p> <p>"8. On January 19, 1994, [Hernandez] signified that the record of Aoyagi has been cleared and that he can pick up his passport at the BID office. In connection therewith, [Hernandez] was invited by Perlas to make the return at a lunchtime meeting to be held at the Diamond Hotel Coffee Shop. Upon arrival thereat, [Hernandez] gave the passport to Atty. Acejas, Aoyagi's counsel, and within less than ten minutes, he left the coffee shop."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p>In his Petition, Acejas narrates some more occurrences as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"1. <em>18<sup>th</sup> December 1993</em> – The law firm of Lucenario Margate Mogpo Tiongco &amp; Acejas was engaged by the spouses Takao Aoyagi and Bethel Grace Pelingon Aoyagi. x x x.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>"3. 22<sup>nd</sup> December 1993 –</p> <p>"a) The managing partner of the law firm, Atty.

Lucenario to <em>'meet his brother-in-law Mr. Expedito Perlas, who happened to be a policeman and a friend of Mr. Takao Aoyagi.'</em> Thus, [Acejas] <em>'met Mr. Perlas for the <u>first</u> time in the afternoon'</em> of this date.</p> <p>"c) Also, for the <u><em>first</em></u> time, [Acejas] met the clients, spouses Aoyagis, at the Diamond Hotel, where they were staying. x x x [Acejas] advised them that the law firm decided that the clients <em>'can file an action for Replevin plus Damages for the recovery of the Japanese passport.'</em></p> <p>"d) The CONTRACT FOR LEGAL SERVICES was signed between the client and the law firm, thru [Acejas] as partner thereof. x x x The amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php. 50,000.00) was agreed to be paid by way of <em>'Case Retainer's/Acceptance Fees,'</em> which was supposed to be payable <em>'upon (the) signing (t)hereof,'</em> and the sum of Php. 2,000.00 by way of <em>appearance fee</em>. However, the client proposed to pay half only of the acceptance fee (Php. 25,000.00), plus the estimated judicial expenses for the filing or docket fees (Php. 15,000.00). x x x It was then further agreed that the <em><u>'balance of Php. 25,000.00 was supposed to be given upon the successful recovery of the Japanese passport</u>.'</em></p> <p>"e) The clients informed [Acejas] that <em>'they are supposed to leave for Davao the following day on the 23<sup>rd</sup> because they will spend their Christmas in Davao City; but they promised that they will be back on the 26<sup>th</sup>, which is a Sunday, so that on the 27<sup>th</sup>, which is a Monday, the complaint against the BID officers will have to be filed in Court.'</em></p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>"6. <em>27<sup>th</sup> December 1993</em> – <em>'(T)he law office received word from Mr. Perlas that the Japanese did not come back on the 26<sup>th</sup> (December), x x x so that the case cannot be filed on the 27<sup>th</sup> instead (it has) to wait for client's instruction.'</em></p> <p>"7. <em>4<sup>th</sup> January 1994</em> – <em>'In the late afternoon, the law firm received a telephone call from Mr. Perlas informing (it) that the Japanese is already in Manila and he was requesting for an appointment with any of the lawyer of the law firm on January 5, 1994.'</em></p> <p>"8. <em>5<sup>th</sup> January 1994</em> – [Acejas] <em>'met for the <u>first</u> time Mr. Filomeno Pelingon Jr.'</em> including a certain Nimoto Akira. x x x.</p> <p>"b) [Acejas] <em>'told Mr. Pelingon Jr. that all the pleadings are ready for filing but, of course, the <u>Japanese client and the wife should first read the complaint and sign</u> if they want to pursue the filing of the complaint against the BID agents.'</em></p> <p>"c) For the <u><em>first</em></u> time, <em>'Mr. Pelingon advised against the intended filing of the case.'</em> x x x He <em>'instead suggested that he wants to directly negotiate with the BID agents.'</em></p> <p>"d) Thereafter, <em>'Mr. Pelingon instructed Mr. Dick Perlas to contact the BID agent who confiscated the Japanese passport.'

In the course of the meeting, a confrontation ensued between [Acejas] and [Hernandez] concerning the legal basis for the confiscation of the passport. [Acejas] <em>demanded for the return of the Japanese passport x x x</em>. Mr. Hernandez <em>'said that if there are no further derogatory report concerning the Japanese client, then in a matter of week (from January 5 to 12), he will return the passport.'</em></p> <p>"f) [Acejas] <em>'gave an ultimatum to Mr. Hernandez that if the Japanese passport will not be returned in one (1) week's time, then (the law firm) will pursue the filing of the replevin case plus the damage suit against him including the other BID agents.'</em></p> <p>"g) 'x x x <em>Mr. Pelingon Jr. for the <u>second</u> time advised against the filing thereof saying that his Japanese brother-in-law would like to negotiate or in his own words 'magbibigay naman [i.e. will give money anyway].'</em></p> <p>"9. <em>8<sup>th</sup> January 1994 –</em></p> <p>"a) Again, <em>'Mr. Perlas called the law office and informed x x x that the Japanese client is now in Manila.'</em> Petitioner attended the meeting they arranged in <em>'(Makati) and meet Dick Perlas, Vladimir Hernandez and Pelingon Jr.</em> x x x.</p> <p>"b) x x x <em>according to Pelingon Jr., the Japanese does not want to meet with anybody because anyway they are willing to pay or negotiate</em>.</p> <p>"c) [Hernandez was also] present at the meeting and [Acejas] <em>'met him for the <u>second</u> time. x x x [Acejas] said that if [Hernandez] will not be able to return the passport <u>on or before January 12, 1994,</u> then the law firm will have no choice but to file the case against him x x x.

It would be illogical to sustain his contention that the envelope represented the balance of his firm's legal fees. That it was given to Hernandez immediately after the return of the passport leads to the inescapable conclusion that the money was a consideration for the return. Moreover, Acejas should have kept the amount if he believed it to be his. The Court agrees with the Sandiganbayan's pronouncement on this point:</p> <blockquote> <p>"x x x. If he believed that the brown envelope contained the balance of the acceptance fee, how come he passed it to Perlas? His passing the brown envelope to Perlas only proves that the same did not contain the balance of the acceptance fee; otherwise, he should have kept and retained it. Moreover, the three prosecution witnesses testified that the brown envelope was being given to Hernandez who refused to accept the same. This further shows that the brown envelope was not for the balance of the acceptance fee because, if it were, why was it given to Hernandez.</p> <p align="center">x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x</p> <p>"Acejas' defense was further weakened by the fact that his testimony as to why he left immediately after the brown envelope was given to him was uncorroborated. He should have presented accused Victoriano to corroborate his testimony since it was the latter who allegedly called him and caused him to leave their table. This, he did not do. The ineluctable conclusion is that he was, indeed, in cahoots with his co-accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong><u>Lawyer's Duty</u></strong></em></p> <p>Acejas alleges that the Sandiganbayan failed to appreciate his lawyer-client relationship with the complainants. He was supposedly only acting in their best interest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and had the right to be present when the passport was to be returned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p> <p>True, as a lawyer, it was his duty to represent his clients in dealing with other people. His presence at Diamond Hotel for the scheduled return of the passport was justified. This fact, however, does not support his innocence</p> <p>Acejas, however, failed to act for or represent the interests of his clients. He knew of the payoff, but did nothing to assist or protect their rights, a fact that strongly indicated that he was to get a share. Thus, he received the money purporting to be the payoff, even if he was not involved in the entrapment operation. The facts revealed that he was a conspirator.</p> <p>The Court reminds lawyers to follow <em>legal ethics</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> when confronted by public officers who extort money. Lawyers must decline and report the matter to the authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> If the extortion is directed at the client, they must advise the client not to perform any illegal act. Moreover, they must report it to the authorities, without having to violate the attorney-client privilege.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Naturally, they must not participate in the illegal act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p> <p>Acejas did not follow these guidelines. Worse, he conspired with the extortionists.</p> <p><em><strong><u>Instigation</u></strong></em></p> <p>Also futile is the contention of petitioners that Pelingon instigated the situation to frame them into accepting the payoff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Instigation is the employment of ways and means to lure persons into the commission of an offense in order to prosecute them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> As opposed to entrapment, criminal intent originates in the mind of the instigator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p> <p>There was no instigation in the present case, because the chain of circumstances showed an extortion attempt. In other words, the criminal intent originated from petitioners, who had arranged for the payoff.</p> <p>During the cross-examination of Bethel Grace Aoyagi, pertinent was Associate Justice Escareal clarifying question as follows:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"AJ ESCAREAL:</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">"[Q:]</div></td> <td>Did Mr. Hernandez say anything when he returned the passport to your husband?</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">"A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">He did not say anything except that he instructed [the] group to abide with the agreement that upon handing of the passport, the money would also be given immediately (<em>'magkaliwaan'</em>)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote> <p><em><strong><u>Alleged Discrepancies</u></strong></em></p> <p>According to Acejas, Pelingon's testimonies given in his Complaint-Affidavit, Supplemental-Affidavit, inquest testimony, testimony in court, and two Affidavits of Desistance were contradictory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> He cites these particular portions of Pelingon's Affidavit:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>"5.

An affidavit of desistance must be ignored when pitted against positive evidence given on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p> <p>Acejas has failed to identify the other material points that were allegedly inconsistent. The Court therefore adopts the Sandiganbayan's finding that these were minor details that were not indicative of the lack of credibility of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> <em>People v.

As long as the mass of testimony jibes on material points, the slight clashing statements neither dilute the witnesses' credibility nor the veracity of their testimony. Thus, inconsistencies and contradictions referring to minor details do not, in any way, destroy the credibility of witnesses, for indeed, such inconsistencies are but natural and even enhance credibility as these discrepancies indicate that the responses are honest and unrehearsed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p><em><strong><u>Suppression of Evidence</u></strong></em></p> <p>Acejas further raises the issue of suppression of evidence.

Further, it showed no prayer that the Sandiganbayan needed to act upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p> <p>Finally we reiterate that, as a rule, factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are conclusive upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> We are convinced that these were clearly based on the evidence adduced in this case.</p> <p>In sum, we find that the prosecution proved the elements of direct bribery. <em>First,</em> there is no question that the offense was committed by a public officer.

Aoyagi, in Davao City and told her to come back to Manila immediately, his sister, in her testimony in Court, declared she did not talk to Perlas through the phone when she was in Davao; (2) NBI Agent Saunars testimony in Court that the amount handed over to him by the complainants was P50,000.00 run counter to Jun Pelingon's testimony that the amount provided by the spouses Aoyagi was P25,000.00; and (3) Jun Pelingon stated in the inquest proceedings that BID Agents Hernandez and Conanan arrived at the Aristocrat on January 5, 1994 30 to 45 minutes after 10:30 a.m. However, in his complaint, he said the BID agents came at 1:00 p.m.</p> <p>"The alleged discrepancies relate to (a) whether or not Dick Perlas called complainants in Davao; (b) how much money the complainants gave to the NBI to be used as marked money; [(c)] what time the BID Agents arrived at the Aristocrat Restaurant on January 5, 1994.</p> <p>"The Court considers these alleged discrepancies to be collateral matters or minor details that do not adversely affect the credibility of the prosecution witnesses or the trustworthiness of the testimonies offered by them. They do not touch upon the commission of the crime itself, which was committed when the demand was made, and when the bribe money was received. It has been ruled that contradictions in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses not on material points are not fatal (<em>People v. Pulo</em>, 147 SCRA 551).
