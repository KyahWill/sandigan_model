Matilde thus concluded that the actions subsequent to the finality of the first order of dismissal were void, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Del Castillo v.

What defendant-movant should have done was to file an answer immediately after the second order of dismissal was set aside.<br><br>On the second assertion of defendant-movant in her Motion to set aside the Decision, suffice it to state that the same is supported by evidence of the plaintiff.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration filed by defendant-movant, thru counsel, is hereby denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On appeal by Matilde, the appellate court, by Decision of November 21, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> set aside the trial court's decision in light of the following observations:<br><blockquote>As noted elsewhere, in its Order dated March 26, 1993, the lower court dismissed the case without prejudice for plaintiff's failure to prosecute (p. 9, record).  On April 22, 1993, plaintiff (herein appellee) filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of the aforesaid Order of dismissal (p. 12, record).  As pointed by defendant-appellant, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the timeliness of the filing of the aforesaid urgent Motion for Reconsideration could not be ascertained</span> inasmuch as movant (plaintiff-appellee) did not indicate therein the date that it received the 26 March 1993 Order of dismissal.  Further, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the motion did not set a specific date for the hearing</span> thereof (p. 13, record).  In its attempt to cure the aforesaid defect, plaintiff-appellee's counsel filed a separate notice of hearing for said motion (p. 14, record).  The record shows that the said <span style="text-decoration: underline;">notice of hearing was filed by plaintiff-appellee on October 27, 1993 and the hearing of the Motion for Reconsideration was set for November 5, 1993</span>.  The record, however, shows that plaintiff-appellee's Motion for Reconsideration was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">granted by the lower court on October 28, 1993 or before the supposed date of hearing of said motion</span> (November 5, 1993).  It is therefore clear that <span style="font-weight: bold;">defendant-appellant was not heard on the said Urgent Motion for Reconsideration.</span>  And as if such procedural anomaly was not enough, the record further shows that <span style="font-weight: bold;">defendant-appellant was not served a copy of the October 28, 1993 Order which granted plaintiff-appellee's Urgent Motion for Reconsideration.</span>  It appears that a copy of said order was sent only to plaintiff-appellee's counsel (back of p. 15, record).  There is truth therefore to defendant-appellant's protestation that her failure to file an answer to the complaint which subsequently resulted in an Order of Default issued on November 8, 1994 was due to the fact that as far as she knew the case was already dismissed in an Order dated March 26, 1993 and she was completely unaware that the case was subsequently reinstated in an Order dated November 28, 1993, of which she was not served a copy, pursuant to plaintiff-appellee's Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of which she was never heard.<br><br>Undoubtedly, plaintiff-appellee's Urgent Motion for Reconsideration of the March 26, 1993 Order of dismissal which was only filed on April 22, 1993 was <span style="font-weight: bold;">fatally flawed for the reason that the timeliness of its filing could not be ascertained</span> inasmuch as the Motion did not state the date of receipt by movant of the Order sought to be reconsidered and for lack of the requisite notice of hearing.  While plaintiff-appellee attempted to cure the latter defect by subsequently filing a separate Notice of Hearing for the aforesaid Motion for Reconsideration, <span style="font-weight: bold;">no hearing thereof was actually conducted by the lower court</span> because nine (9) days before the supposed date of hearing of said motion or on October 28, 1993 to be precise, the lower court had already issued an Order granting plaintiff-appellee's Motion for Reconsideration.  The Court finds therefore that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Order of dismissal dated March 26, 1993 which was final in nature had already acquired final and executory character with the inevitable consequence that all subsequent proceedings taken by the court below like the October 23, 1993</span> Order which granted plaintiff-appellee's urgent Motion for Reconsideration and reinstated the case, the November 8, 1994 Order which declared defendant-appellant in default, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ex-parte</span> hearing conducted on July 10, 1995, and the insuing October 19, 1995 Decision which is the subject of the herein appeal, were all taken or issued by the court <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a quo</span> without authority and are therefore <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">NULL and VOID</span>.  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Hence, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> filed by petitioner which argues that:<br><ol><li>Matilde's right to be heard had been waived by her inaction.<br><br></li><li>Courts will set aside technicalities and decide a case on the merits.<br><br></li><li>The order of dismissal without prejudice did not become final as it could be "revived within a reasonable period of time," citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Medrano &amp; Associates v. Roxas &amp; Company</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> which held:<br></li></ol><blockquote>Moreover, even assuming said dismissal order had become final, the said dismissal was without prejudice.  Plaintiff can very well refile the case.  There is no reason why instead of asking plaintiff to refile the case, the case can not be reopened in the interest of justice.<br><br>It is far better to dispose of a case on the merits rather than on a technicality.  That is the primordial end of justice.<br></blockquote><ol start="4"><li>The trial court committed a mistake in dismissing the complaint.<br><br></li><li>The trial court may rectify its own mistake and reinstate the complaint citing Sec. 5(g), Rule 135.<br><br></li><li>There was no need to furnish copy of the Order dated October 28 (not 25), 1993 (granting petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the first order of dismissal without prejudice) to Matilde as she had been priorly served with summons but she filed no Answer and, in any event, she did not raise this matter in her Motion for Reconsideration of the trial court's Decision.<br></li></ol>The petition must be denied for lack of merit.<br><br>The Court of Appeals correctly found that all proceedings taken after the issuance of the March 23, 1993 first order of dismissal without prejudice are void.   For, indeed, petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of said order is fatally flawed in light of the procedural infirmities reflected in the above recital of the incidents in the case including lack of indication that said motion was timely filed.  Petitioner in fact never ever denied that it was not timely filed.<br><br>That petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration may indeed have been filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period gains credence with the declaration by the trial court that, as priorly quoted, "the plaintiff can revive the case anytime, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even after the lapse of the 15-day reglementary period from receipt of the</span> . . . <span style="text-decoration: underline;">order of dismissal</span> and that it (trial court) treated petitioner's motion as a Motion to Revive."<br><br>The treatment by the trial court of petitioner's motion for reconsideration as one for revival is of course erroneous.  For <span style="font-style: italic;">BaÃ±ares II v. Balising</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>This Court has previously held that an order dismissing a case without prejudice is a final order if no motion for reconsideration or appeal therefrom is timely filed.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Olympia International vs. Court of Appeals</span>, we stated, thus:<br><br>The dismissal without prejudice of a complaint does not however mean that said dismissal order was any less final.  Such order of dismissal is complete in all details, and though without prejudice, nonetheless finally disposed of the matter.  It was not merely an interlocutory order but a final disposition of the complaint.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The law grants an aggrieved party a period of fifteen (15) days from his receipt of the court's decision or order disposing of the action or proceeding to appeal or move to reconsider the same.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">After the lapse of the fifteen-day period, an order becomes final and executory and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is beyond the power or jurisdiction of the court which rendered it to further amend or revoke</span>.  A final judgment or order cannot be modified in any respect, even if the modification sought is for the purpose of correcting an erroneous conclusion by the court which rendered the same.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">After the order of dismissal of a case without prejudice has become final, and therefore becomes outside the court's power to amend and modify, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">party who wishes to reinstate the case has no other remedy but to file a new complaint</span>.</span>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Rodriguez, Jr.  v. Aguilar, Sr.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> echoed the above-quoted ruling.<br><br>The facts and circumstances attendant to <span style="font-style: italic;">Medrano</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> cited by petitioner, wherein this Court held that even assuming that the therein order of dismissal without prejudice had become final, "[t]here was no reason why instead of asking plaintiff to refile the case, the case cannot be reopened in the interest of justice," are clearly different from those of the present case.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Medrano</span>, the trial court, by Order of March 5, 1986, <span style="font-style: italic;">motu propio</span> dismissed the case without prejudice for failure to prosecute.  On May 5, 1986, the plaintiff filed a motion to set the case for hearing on May 9, 1986.  Before that or on May 7, 1986, the plaintiff's counsel received a copy of the March 5, 1986 order of dismissal.  In remanding the case for further proceedings by the trial court, this Court held:<br><blockquote>Although the March 5, 1986 order of dismissal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appears to have become final</span> as plaintiff failed to appeal therefrom or to file a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period, the reason plaintiff failed to act accordingly appears to be that even <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before receipt of said notice of the dismissal order he filed a motion to set the case for hearing</span>.  He was obviously awaiting action on the same.  Nevertheless, the trial court reset the hearing of the case not once but three times.  The only logical consequence of these actions is that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trial court effectively reconsidered its order of dismissal dated March 5</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In other words, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Medrano</span>, this Court took into account the fact that, among other things, <span style="font-style: italic;">before the plaintiff received a copy of the dismissal without prejudice order</span>, it filed before the trial court a motion to set the case for hearing, which the trial court granted when it set the case for hearing three times, which action of the trial court this Court took to logically mean that the order of dismissal was "effectively reconsidered." <br><br>In fine, the appellate court's nullification of the trial court's October 28, 1994 Order granting petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the March 26, 1993 final and executory order and of all proceedings taken thereafter is in order.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Records, pp. 1-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 9 (emphasis, underscoring and italics supplied).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 12-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Id. at 12 (emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 12-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 14 (underscoring supplied).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 20.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at 23-24.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 28-29  (emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Id. at 31-32.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Id. ats 33.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Id. at 37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Id. at 62.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Ibid.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Id. at 64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Id. at 38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Id. at 61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> G.R.
