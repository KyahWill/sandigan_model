				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A transparent government is one of the hallmarks of a truly republican state.  Even in the early history of republican thought, however, it has been recognized that the head of government may keep certain information confidential in pursuit of the public interest.  Explaining the reason for vesting executive power in only one magistrate, a distinguished delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention said: "Decision, activity, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">secrecy</span>, and dispatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man, in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number; and in proportion as the number is increased, these qualities will be diminished."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><div align="justify"><br>History has been witness, however, to the fact that the power to withhold information lends itself to abuse, hence, the necessity to guard it zealously.<br><br>The present consolidated petitions for certiorari and prohibition proffer that the President has abused such power by issuing Executive Order No. 464 (E.O. 464) last September 28, 2005. They thus pray for its declaration as null and void for being unconstitutional.<br><br>In resolving the controversy, this Court shall proceed with the recognition that the issuance under review has come from a co-equal branch of government, which thus entitles it to a strong presumption of constitutionality. Once the challenged order is found to be indeed violative of the Constitution, it is duty-bound to declare it so.  For the Constitution, being the highest expression of the sovereign will of the Filipino people, must prevail over any issuance of the government that contravenes its mandates.<br><br>In the exercise of its legislative power, the Senate of the Philippines, through its various Senate Committees, conducts inquiries or investigations in aid of legislation which call for, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, the attendance of officials and employees of the executive department, bureaus, and offices including those employed in Government Owned and Controlled Corporations, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and the Philippine National Police (PNP).<br><br>On September 21 to 23, 2005, the Committee of the Senate as a whole issued invitations to various officials of the Executive Department for them to appear on September 29, 2005 as resource speakers in a public hearing on the railway project of the North Luzon Railways Corporation with the China National Machinery and Equipment Group (hereinafter North Rail Project).  The public hearing was sparked by a privilege speech of Senator Juan Ponce Enrile urging the Senate to investigate the alleged overpricing and other unlawful provisions of the contract covering the North Rail Project.<br><br>The Senate Committee on National Defense and Security likewise issued invitations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated September 22, 2005 to the following officials of the AFP: the Commanding General of the Philippine Army, Lt. Gen. Hermogenes C. Esperon; Inspector General of the AFP Vice Admiral Mateo M. Mayuga; Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence of the AFP Rear Admiral Tirso R. Danga; Chief of the Intelligence Service of the AFP Brig. Gen. Marlu Q. Quevedo; Assistant Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Brig. Gen. Francisco V. Gudani; and Assistant Commandant, Corps of Cadets of the PMA, Col. Alexander F. Balutan, for them to attend as resource persons in a public hearing scheduled on September 28, 2005 on the following: (1) Privilege Speech of Senator Aquilino Q. Pimentel Jr., delivered on June 6, 2005 entitled "Bunye has Provided Smoking Gun or has Opened a Can of Worms that Show Massive Electoral Fraud in the Presidential Election of May 2005"; (2) Privilege Speech of Senator Jinggoy E. Estrada delivered on July 26, 2005 entitled "The Philippines as the Wire-Tapping Capital of the World"; (3) Privilege Speech of Senator Rodolfo Biazon delivered on August 1, 2005 entitled "Clear and Present Danger"; (4) Senate Resolution No. 285  filed by Senator Maria Ana Consuelo Madrigal - Resolution Directing the Committee on National Defense and Security to Conduct an Inquiry, in Aid of Legislation, and in the National Interest, on the Role of the Military in the So-called "Gloriagate Scandal"; and (5) Senate Resolution No. 295 filed by Senator Biazon - Resolution Directing the Committee on National Defense and Security to Conduct an Inquiry, in Aid of    Legislation, on the Wire-Tapping of the President of the Philippines.<br><br>Also invited to the above-said hearing scheduled on September 28 2005 was the AFP Chief of Staff, General Generoso S. Senga who, by letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated September 27, 2005, requested for its postponement "due to a pressing operational situation that demands [his] utmost personal attention" while "some of the invited AFP officers are currently attending to other urgent operational matters."<br><br>On September 28, 2005, Senate President Franklin M. Drilon received from Executive Secretary Eduardo R. Ermita a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated September 27, 2005 "respectfully request[ing] for the postponement of the hearing [regarding the NorthRail project] to which various officials of the Executive Department have been invited" in order to "afford said officials ample time and opportunity to study and prepare for the various issues so that they may better enlighten the Senate Committee on its investigation."<br><br>Senate President Drilon, however, wrote<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Executive Secretary Ermita that the Senators "are unable to accede to [his request]" as it "was sent belatedly" and "[a]ll preparations and arrangements as well as notices to all resource persons were completed [the previous] week."<br><br>Senate President Drilon likewise received on September 28, 2005 a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> from the President of the North Luzon Railways Corporation Jose L. Cortes, Jr. requesting that the hearing on the NorthRail project be postponed or cancelled until a copy of the report of the UP Law Center on the contract agreements relative to the project had been secured.<br><br>On September 28, 2005, the President issued E.O. 464, "Ensuring Observance of the Principle of Separation of Powers, Adherence to the Rule on Executive Privilege and Respect for the Rights of Public Officials Appearing in Legislative Inquiries in Aid of Legislation Under the Constitution, and For Other Purposes,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which, pursuant to Section 6 thereof, took effect immediately.  The salient provisions of the Order are as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Appearance by Heads of Departments Before Congress.</span> - In accordance with Article VI, Section 22 of the Constitution and to implement the Constitutional provisions on the separation of powers between co-equal branches of the government, <b>all heads of departments of the Executive Branch of the government shall secure the consent of the President prior to appearing before either House of Congress.</b><br><br>When the security of the State or the public interest so requires and the President so states in writing, the appearance shall only be conducted in executive session.<br><br>SECTION. 2.<span style="font-style: italic;"> Nature, Scope and Coverage of Executive Privilege. </span>-<br><br>(a) Nature and Scope. - The rule of confidentiality based on executive privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution (<span style="font-style: italic;">Almonte vs. Vasquez,</span> G.R.

On even date which was also the scheduled date of the hearing on the alleged wiretapping, Gen. Senga sent a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to Senator Biazon, Chairperson of the Committee on National Defense and Security, informing him "that per instruction of [President Arroyo], thru the Secretary of National Defense, no officer of the [AFP] is authorized to appear before any Senate or Congressional hearings without seeking a written approval from the President" and "that no approval has been granted by the President to any AFP officer to appear before the public hearing of the Senate Committee on National Defense and Security scheduled [on] 28 September 2005."<br><br>Despite the communications received from Executive Secretary Ermita and Gen. Senga, the investigation scheduled by the Committee on National Defense and Security pushed through, with only Col. Balutan and Brig. Gen. Gudani among all the AFP officials invited attending.<br><br>For defying President Arroyo's order barring military personnel from testifying before legislative inquiries without her approval, Brig. Gen. Gudani and Col. Balutan were relieved from their military posts and were made to face court martial proceedings.<br><br>As to the NorthRail project hearing scheduled on September 29, 2005, Executive Secretary Ermita, citing E.O. 464, sent letter of regrets, in response to the invitations sent to the following government officials:  Light Railway Transit Authority Administrator Melquiades Robles, Metro Rail Transit Authority Administrator Roberto Lastimoso, Department of Justice (DOJ) Chief State Counsel Ricardo V.

Additionally, petitioners claim that E.O. 464 infringes on their rights and impedes them from fulfilling their respective obligations. Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bayan Muna</span> alleges  that E.O. 464 infringes on its right as a political party entitled to participate in governance; Satur Ocampo, <span style="font-style: italic;">et al. </span>allege that E.O. 464 infringes on their rights and duties as members of Congress to conduct investigation in aid of legislation and conduct oversight functions in the implementation of laws; Courage alleges that the tenure of its members in public office is predicated on, and threatened by, their submission to the requirements of E.O. 464 should they be summoned by Congress; and CODAL alleges that its members have a sworn duty to uphold the rule of law, and their rights to information and to transparent governance are threatened by the imposition of E.O. 464.<br><br>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R.

To resolve the question of whether such withholding of information violates the Constitution, consideration of the general power of Congress to obtain information, otherwise known as the power of inquiry, is in order.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The power of inquiry</span><br><br>The Congress power of inquiry is expressly recognized in Section 21 of Article VI of the Constitution which reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. The Senate or the House of Representatives or any of its respective committees may conduct <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inquiries in aid of legislation</span> in accordance with its duly published rules of procedure. The rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries shall be respected.  (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>This provision is worded exactly as Section 8 of Article VIII of the 1973 Constitution except that, in the latter, it vests the power of inquiry in the unicameral legislature established therein - the <span style="font-style: italic;">Batasang Pambansa </span>- and its committees.<br><br>The 1935 Constitution did not contain a similar provision.  Nonetheless, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arnault v. Nazareno</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> a case decided in 1950 under that Constitution, the Court already recognized that the power of inquiry is inherent in the power to legislate.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Arnault</span> involved a Senate investigation of the reportedly anomalous purchase of the Buenavista and Tambobong Estates by the Rural Progress Administration.  Arnault, who was considered a leading witness in the controversy, was called to testify thereon by the Senate.  On account of his refusal to answer the questions of the senators on an important point, he was, by resolution of the Senate, detained for contempt.  Upholding the Senate's power to punish Arnault for contempt, this Court held:<br><blockquote>Although there is no provision in the Constitution expressly investing either House of Congress with power to make investigations and exact testimony to the end that it may exercise its legislative functions advisedly and effectively, such power is so far incidental to the legislative function as to be implied.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>That this power of inquiry is broad enough to cover officials of the executive branch may be deduced from the same case.  The power of inquiry, the Court therein ruled, is co-extensive with the power to legislate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  The matters which may be a proper subject of legislation and those which may be a proper subject of investigation are one.  It follows that the operation of government, being a legitimate subject for legislation, is a proper subject for investigation.<br><br>Thus, the Court found that the Senate investigation of the government transaction involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arnault</span> was a proper exercise of the power of inquiry. Besides being related to the expenditure of public funds of which Congress is the guardian, the transaction, the Court held, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">also involved government agencies created by Congress and officers whose positions it is within the power of Congress to regulate or even abolish.</span>"<br><br>Since Congress has authority to inquire into the operations of the executive branch, it would be incongruous to hold that the power of inquiry does not extend to executive officials who are the most familiar with and informed on executive operations.<br><br>As discussed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arnault,</span> the power of inquiry, "with process to enforce it," is grounded on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">necessity</span> of information in the legislative process.  If the information possessed by executive officials on the operation of their offices is necessary for wise legislation on that subject, by parity of reasoning, Congress has the right to that information and the power to compel the disclosure thereof.<br><br>As evidenced by the American experience during the so-called "McCarthy era," however, the right of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation is, in theory, no less susceptible to abuse than executive or judicial power.  It may thus be subjected to judicial review pursuant to the Court's certiorari powers under Section 1, Article VIII of the Constitution.<br><br>For one, as noted in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon v. Senate Blue Ribbon Committee</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the inquiry itself might not properly be in aid of legislation, and thus beyond the constitutional power of Congress.  Such inquiry could not usurp judicial functions.  Parenthetically, one possible way for Congress to avoid such a result as occurred in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bengzon</span> is to indicate in its invitations to the public officials concerned, or to any person for that matter, the possible needed statute which prompted the need for the inquiry.  Given such statement in its invitations, along with the usual indication of the subject of inquiry and the questions relative to and in furtherance thereof, there would be less room for speculation on the part of the person invited on whether the inquiry is in aid of legislation.<br><br>Section 21, Article VI likewise establishes crucial safeguards that proscribe the legislative power of inquiry. The provision requires that the inquiry be done in accordance with the Senate or House's duly published rules of procedure, necessarily implying the constitutional infirmity of an inquiry conducted without duly published rules of procedure.  Section 21 also mandates that the rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries be respected, an imposition that obligates Congress to adhere to the guarantees in the Bill of Rights.<br><br>These abuses are, of course, remediable before the courts, upon the proper suit filed by the persons affected, even if they belong to the executive branch.  Nonetheless, there may be exceptional circumstances, none appearing to obtain at present, wherein a clear pattern of abuse of the legislative power of inquiry might be established, resulting in palpable violations of the rights guaranteed to members of the executive department under the Bill of Rights.  In such instances, depending on the particulars of each case, attempts by the Executive Branch to forestall these abuses may be accorded judicial sanction.<br><br>Even where the inquiry is in aid of legislation, there are still recognized exemptions to the power of inquiry, which exemptions fall under the rubric of "executive privilege."

The Court, nonetheless, rejected the President's claim of privilege, ruling that the privilege must be balanced against the public interest in the fair administration of criminal justice.

It quoted the following portion of the Nixon decision which explains the basis for the privilege:<br><blockquote>"The expectation of a President to the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">confidentiality</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">his</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">conversations and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">correspondences,</span> like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations,</span> for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decision-making.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">A</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">President</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">assist</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">him must</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">free</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">explore</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">alternatives</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">process</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shaping</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">policies</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">making decisions</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">so</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">way</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">many</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unwilling</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">express</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">except privately</span>.  These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution</span> x x x "  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Almonte </span>involved a subpoena <span style="font-style: italic;">duces tecum</span> issued by the Ombudsman against the therein petitioners.  It did not involve, as expressly stated in the  decision, the right of the people to information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup>  Nonetheless, the Court  recognized that there are certain types of information which the government may withhold from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">public</span>, thus acknowledging, in substance if not in name, that executive privilege may be claimed against citizens' demands for information.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Chavez v. PCGG,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the Court held that this jurisdiction recognizes the common law holding that there is a "governmental privilege<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> against public disclosure</span> with respect to state secrets regarding military, diplomatic and other national security matters."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  The same case held that closed-door Cabinet meetings are also a recognized limitation on the right to information.<br><br>Similarly, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chavez v. Public Estates Authority</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the Court ruled that the right to information does not extend to matters recognized as "privileged information under the separation of powers,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> by which the Court meant Presidential conversations, correspondences, and discussions in closed-door Cabinet meetings.  It also held that information on military and diplomatic secrets and those affecting national security, and information on investigations of crimes by law enforcement agencies before the prosecution of the accused were exempted from the right to information.<br><br>From the above discussion on the meaning and scope of executive privilege, both in the United States and in this jurisdiction, a clear principle emerges.  Executive privilege, whether asserted against Congress, the courts, or the public, is recognized only in relation to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">certain types of information of a sensitive character.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span> While executive privilege is a constitutional concept, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">claim </span>thereof may be valid or not depending on the ground invoked to justify it and the context in which it is made.  Noticeably absent is any recognition that executive officials are exempt from the duty to disclose information by the mere fact of being executive officials.  Indeed, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the extraordinary character of the exemptions indicates that the presumption inclines heavily against executive secrecy and in favor of disclosure.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Validity of Section 1</span><br><br>Section 1 is similar to Section 3 in that both require the officials covered by them to secure the consent of the President prior to appearing before Congress.  There are significant differences between the two provisions, however, which constrain this Court to discuss the validity of these provisions separately.<br><br>Section 1 specifically applies to department heads.  It does not, unlike Section 3, require a prior determination by any official whether they are covered by E.O. 464.  The President herself has, through the challenged order, made the determination that they are. Further, unlike also Section 3, the coverage of department heads under Section 1 is not made to depend on the department heads' possession of any <span style="font-weight: bold;">information</span> which might be covered by executive privilege.  In fact, in marked contrast to Section 3 <span style="font-style: italic;"> vis-á-vis </span>Section 2, there is no reference to executive privilege at all.  Rather, the required prior consent under Section 1 is grounded on Article VI, Section 22 of the Constitution on what has been referred to as the question hour.<br><blockquote>SECTION 22. The heads of departments may upon their own initiative, with the consent of the President, or upon the request of either House, as the rules of each House shall provide, appear before and be heard by such House on any matter pertaining to their departments. Written questions shall be submitted to the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House of Representatives at least three days before their scheduled appearance. Interpellations shall not be limited to written questions, but may cover matters related thereto. When the security of the State or the public interest so requires and the President so states in writing, the appearance shall be conducted in executive session.<br></blockquote>Determining the validity of Section 1 thus requires an examination of the meaning of Section 22 of Article VI. Section 22 which provides for the question hour must be interpreted<span style="font-style: italic;"> vis-á-vis </span>Section 21 which provides for the power of either House of Congress to "conduct inquiries in aid of legislation."  As the following excerpt of the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission shows, the framers were aware that these two provisions involved distinct functions of Congress.<br><blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG. x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When we amended <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 20</span></span> [now Section 22 on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Question Hour] yesterday, I noticed that members of the Cabinet cannot be compelled anymore to appear before the House of Representatives or before the Senate. </span> I have a particular problem in this regard, Madam President, because in our experience in the Regular Batasang Pambansa - as the Gentleman himself has experienced in the interim Batasang Pambansa - one of the most competent inputs that we can put in our committee deliberations, either in aid of legislation or in congressional investigations, is the testimonies of Cabinet ministers.  We usually invite them, but if they do not come and it is a congressional investigation, we usually issue subpoenas.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">I want to be clarified on a statement made by Commissioner Suarez when he said that the fact that the Cabinet ministers may refuse to come to the House of Representatives or the Senate [when requested under Section 22] does not mean that they need not come when they are invited or subpoenaed by the committee of either House when it comes to inquiries in aid of legislation </span>or congressional investigation<span style="font-weight: bold;">.  According to Commissioner Suarez, that is allowed and their presence can be had under Section 21</span>.  Does the gentleman confirm this, Madam President?<br><br>MR. DAVIDE.  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We confirm that,</span> Madam President, because Section 20 refers only to what was originally the Question Hour, whereas,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Section 21 would refer specifically to inquiries in aid of legislation,</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>under which anybody for that matter, may be summoned and <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">if he refuses, he can be held in contempt of the House</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>A distinction was thus made between inquiries in aid of legislation and the question hour.  While attendance was meant to be discretionary in the question hour, it was compulsory in inquiries in aid of legislation.  The reference to Commissioner Suarez bears noting, he being one of the proponents of the amendment to make the appearance of department heads discretionary in the question hour.<br><br>So clearly was this distinction conveyed to the members of the Commission that the Committee on Style, precisely in recognition of this distinction, later moved the provision on question hour from its original position as Section 20 in the original draft down to Section 31, far from the provision on inquiries in aid of legislation.  This gave rise to the following exchange during the deliberations:<br><blockquote>MR. GUINGONA. [speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Style]  We now go, Mr. Presiding Officer, to the Article on Legislative and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may I request the chairperson of the Legislative Department, Commissioner Davide, to give his reaction.</span><br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jamir).  Commissioner Davide is recognized.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE.  Thank you, Mr. Presiding Officer. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I have only one reaction to the Question Hour.  I propose that instead of putting it as </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Section 31</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, it should follow Legislative Inquiries.</span><br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER.  What does the committee say?<br><br>MR. GUINGONA. I ask Commissioner Maambong to reply, Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>MR. MAAMBONG.  <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Actually, we considered that previously when we sequenced this but we reasoned that in Section 21, which is Legislative Inquiry, it is actually a power of Congress in terms of its own lawmaking; whereas, a Question Hour is not actually a power in terms of its own lawmaking power</span> because in Legislative Inquiry, it is in aid of legislation.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">And so we put Question Hour as Section 31</span>.  I hope Commissioner Davide will consider this.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Question Hour is closely related with the legislative power, and it is precisely as a complement to or a supplement of the Legislative Inquiry. </span> The appearance of the members of Cabinet would be very, very essential not only in the application of check and balance but also, in effect, in aid of legislation.<br><br>MR. MAAMBONG. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> After conferring with the committee, we find merit in the suggestion of Commissioner Davide.</span>  In other words, we are accepting that and so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this Section 31 would now become Section 22</span>.  Would it be, Commissioner Davide?<br><br>MR. DAVIDE. Yes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Consistent with their statements earlier in the deliberations, Commissioners Davide and Maambong proceeded from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the same assumption</span> that these provisions pertained to two different functions of the legislature.  Both Commissioners understood that the power to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation is different from the power to conduct inquiries during the question hour.  Commissioner Davide's only concern was that the two provisions on these distinct powers be placed closely together, they being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complementary</span> to each other.  Neither Commissioner considered them as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">identical</span> functions of Congress.<br><br>The foregoing opinion was not the two Commissioners' alone. From the above-quoted exchange, Commissioner Maambong's committee - the Committee on Style - shared the view that the two provisions reflected distinct functions of Congress.  Commissioner Davide, on the other hand, was speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Legislative Department.  His views may thus be presumed as representing that of his Committee.<br><br>In the context of a parliamentary system of government, the "question hour" has a definite meaning.  It is a period of confrontation initiated by Parliament to hold the Prime Minister and the other ministers accountable for their acts and the operation of the government,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> corresponding to what is known in Britain as the question period.  There was a specific provision for a question hour in the 1973 Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> which made the appearance of ministers mandatory.  The same perfectly conformed to the parliamentary system established by that Constitution, where the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> ministers are also members of the legislature and are directly accountable to it.</span><br><blockquote>An essential feature of the parliamentary system of government is the immediate accountability of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to the National Assembly.  They shall be responsible to the National Assembly for the program of government and shall determine the guidelines of national policy.  Unlike in the presidential system where the tenure of office of all elected officials cannot be terminated before their term expired, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet remain in office only as long as they enjoy the confidence of the National Assembly.  The moment this confidence is lost the Prime Minister and the Cabinet may be changed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote>The framers of the 1987 Constitution removed the mandatory nature of such appearance during the question hour in the present Constitution so as to conform more fully to a system of separation of powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>  To that extent, the question hour, as it is presently understood in this jurisdiction, departs from the question period of the parliamentary system.  That department heads may not be required to appear in a question hour does not, however, mean that the legislature is rendered powerless to elicit information from them in all circumstances.  In fact, in light of the absence of a mandatory question period, the need to enforce Congress' right to executive information<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in the performance of its legislative function</span> becomes more imperative.  As Schwartz observes:<br><blockquote>Indeed,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> if the separation of powers has anything to tell us on the subject under discussion, it is that the Congress has the right to obtain information from any source - even from officials of departments and agencies in the executive branch.</span>  In the United States there is, unlike the situation which prevails in a parliamentary system such as that in Britain, a clear separation between the legislative and executive branches. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is this very separation that makes the congressional right to obtain information from the executive so essential, </span>if the functions of the Congress as the elected representatives of the people are adequately to be carried out</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The absence of close rapport between the legislative and executive branches in this country, comparable to those which exist under a parliamentary system, and the nonexistence in the Congress of an institution such as the British question period have perforce made reliance by the Congress upon its right to obtain information from the executive essential, <span style="font-weight: bold;">if it is intelligently to perform its legislative tasks.</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span> Unless the Congress possesses the right to obtain executive information, its power of oversight of administration in a system such as ours becomes a power devoid of most of its practical content, since it depends for its effectiveness solely upon information parceled out ex gratia by the executive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Sections 21 and 22, therefore, while closely related and complementary to each other, should not be considered as pertaining to the same power of Congress.  One specifically relates to the power to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation, the aim of which is to elicit information that may be used for legislation, while the other pertains to the power to conduct a question hour, the objective of which is to obtain information in pursuit of Congress' oversight function.<br><br>When Congress merely seeks to be informed on how department heads are implementing the statutes which it has issued, its right to such information is not as imperative as that of the President to whom, as Chief Executive, such department heads must give a report of their performance as a matter of duty. In such instances, Section 22, in keeping with the separation of powers, states that Congress may only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">request</span> their appearance.  Nonetheless, when the inquiry in which Congress requires their appearance is "in aid of legislation" under Section 21, the appearance is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandatory</span> for the same reasons stated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Arnault</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>In fine, the oversight function of Congress may be facilitated by compulsory process only to the extent that it is performed in pursuit of legislation. This is consistent with the intent discerned from the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission.<br><br>Ultimately, the power of Congress to compel the appearance of executive officials under Section 21 and the lack of it under Section 22 find their basis in the principle of separation of powers.  While the executive branch is a co-equal branch of the legislature, it cannot frustrate the power of Congress to legislate by refusing to comply with its demands for information.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">When Congress exercises its power of inquiry, the only way for department heads to exempt themselves therefrom is by a valid claim of privilege.  They are not exempt by the mere fact that they are department heads</span>. Only one executive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">official</span> may be exempted from this power - the President on whom executive power is vested, hence, beyond the reach of Congress except through the power of impeachment. It is based on her being the highest official of the executive branch, and the due respect accorded to a co-equal branch of government which is sanctioned by a long-standing custom.<br><br>By the same token, members of the Supreme Court are also exempt from this power of inquiry.  Unlike the Presidency, judicial power is vested in a collegial body; hence, each member thereof is exempt on the basis not only of separation of powers but also on the fiscal autonomy and the constitutional independence of the judiciary.  This point is not in dispute, as even counsel for the Senate, Sen. Joker Arroyo, admitted it during the oral argument upon interpellation of the Chief Justice.<br><br>Having established the proper interpretation of Section 22, Article VI of the Constitution, the Court now proceeds to pass on the constitutionality of Section 1 of E.O. 464.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 1, in view of its specific reference to Section 22 of Article VI of the Constitution and the absence of any reference to inquiries in aid of legislation, must be construed as limited in its application to appearances of department heads<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> in the question hour</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>contemplated in the provision of said Section 22 of Article VI.  The reading is dictated by the basic rule of construction that issuances must be interpreted, as much as possible, in a way that will render it constitutional.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The requirement then to secure presidential consent under Section 1, limited as it is only to appearances in the question hour,  is valid on its face</span>.  For under Section 22, Article VI of the Constitution, the appearance of department heads in the question hour is discretionary on their part.<br><br>Section 1 cannot, however, be applied to appearances of department heads <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in inquiries in aid of legislation.</span>  Congress is not bound in such instances to respect the refusal of the department head to appear in such inquiry, unless a valid claim of privilege is subsequently made, either by the President herself or by the Executive Secretary.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Validity of Sections 2 and 3</span><br><br>Section 3 of E.O. 464 requires all the public officials enumerated in Section 2(b) to secure the consent of the President prior to appearing before either house of Congress.  The enumeration is broad.  It covers all senior officials of executive departments, all officers of the AFP and the PNP, and all senior national security officials <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who, in the judgment of the heads of offices designated in the same section</span> (i.e. department heads, Chief of Staff of the AFP, Chief of the PNP, and the National Security Adviser), are <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">"covered by the executive privilege."</span><br><br>The enumeration also includes such other officers <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as may be determined by the President</span>.  Given the title of Section 2 - "Nature, Scope and Coverage of Executive Privilege" -, it is evident that under the rule of <span style="font-style: italic;">ejusdem generis</span>, the determination by the President under this provision is intended to be based on a similar finding of coverage under executive privilege.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">En passant,</span> the Court notes that Section 2(b) of E.O. 464 virtually states that executive privilege actually covers persons.  Such is a misuse of the doctrine.  Executive privilege, as discussed above, is properly invoked in relation to specific categories of <span style="font-weight: bold;">information</span> and not to categories of persons.<br><br>In light, however, of Sec 2(a) of E.O. 464 which deals with the nature, scope and coverage of executive privilege, the reference to persons being "covered by the executive privilege" may be read as an abbreviated way of saying that the person is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in possession of information</span> which is, in the judgment of the head of office concerned, privileged as defined in Section 2(a).  The Court shall thus proceed on the assumption that this is the intention of the challenged order.<br><br>Upon a determination by the designated head of office or by the President that an official is "covered by the executive privilege," such official is subjected to the requirement that he first secure the consent of the President prior to appearing before Congress. This requirement effectively bars the appearance of the official concerned unless the same is permitted by the President.  The proviso allowing the President to give its consent means nothing more than that the President may reverse a prohibition which already exists by virtue of E.O. 464.<br><br>Thus, underlying this requirement of prior consent is the determination by a head of office, authorized by the President under E.O. 464, or by the President herself, that such official is in possession of information that is covered by executive privilege.  This determination then becomes the basis for the official's not showing up in the legislative investigation.<br><br>In view thereof, whenever an official invokes E.O. 464 to justify his failure to be present, such invocation must be construed as a declaration to Congress that the President, or a head of office authorized by the President, has determined that the requested information is privileged, and that the President has not reversed such determination.  Such declaration, however, even without mentioning the term "executive privilege," amounts to an implied claim that the information is being withheld by the executive branch, by authority of the President, on the basis of executive privilege.  Verily, there is an <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">implied claim of privilege</span>.</span><br><br>The letter dated September 28, 2005 of respondent Executive Secretary Ermita to Senate President Drilon illustrates the implied nature of the claim of privilege authorized by E.O. 464.  It reads:<br><blockquote>In connection with the inquiry to be conducted by the Committee of the Whole regarding the Northrail Project of the North Luzon Railways Corporation on 29 September 2005 at 10:00 a.m., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please be informed that officials of the Executive Department invited to appear at the meeting will not be able to attend the same without the consent of the President, pursuant to Executive Order No. 464 (s. 2005), </span>entitled "Ensuring Observance Of The Principle Of Separation Of Powers, Adherence To The Rule On Executive Privilege And Respect For The Rights Of Public Officials Appearing In Legislative Inquiries In Aid Of Legislation Under The Constitution, And For Other Purposes".  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Said officials have not secured the required consent from the President</span>. (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The letter does not explicitly invoke executive privilege or that the matter on which these officials are being requested to be resource persons falls under the recognized grounds of the privilege to justify their absence.  Nor does it expressly state that in view of the lack of consent from the President under E.O. 464, they cannot attend the hearing.<br><br>Significant premises in this letter, however, are left unstated, deliberately or not.  The letter assumes that the invited officials are covered by E.O. 464.  As explained earlier, however, to be covered by the order means that a determination has been made, by the designated head of office or the President, that the invited official possesses information that is covered by executive privilege.  Thus, although it is not stated in the letter that such determination has been made, the same must be deemed implied.  Respecting the statement that the invited officials have not secured the consent of the President, it only means that the President has not reversed the standing prohibition against their appearance before Congress.<br><br>Inevitably, Executive Secretary Ermita's letter leads to the conclusion that the executive branch, either through the President or the heads of offices authorized under E.O. 464, has made a determination that the information required by the Senate is privileged, and that, at the time of writing, there has been no contrary pronouncement from the President.  In fine, an implied claim of privilege has been made by the executive.<br><br>While there is no Philippine case that directly addresses the issue of whether executive privilege may be invoked against Congress, it is gathered from <span style="font-style: italic;">Chavez v. PEA</span> that certain information in the possession of the executive may validly be claimed as privileged even against Congress. Thus, the case holds:<br><blockquote>There is no claim by PEA that the information demanded by petitioner is<span style="font-weight: bold;"> privileged information rooted in the separation of powers.</span>  The information does not cover <span style="font-weight: bold;">Presidential conversations, correspondences, or discussions during closed-door Cabinet meetings which, like internal-deliberations of the Supreme Court and other collegiate courts, or executive sessions of either house of Congress, are recognized as confidential.  This kind of information cannot be pried open by a co-equal branch of government.</span>  A frank exchange of exploratory ideas and assessments, free from the glare of publicity and pressure by interested parties, is essential <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to protect the independence of decision-making of those tasked to exercise </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Presidential, Legislative and Judicial power. </span> This is not the situation in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 3 of E.O. 464, therefore, cannot be dismissed outright as invalid by the mere fact that it sanctions claims of executive privilege.  This Court must look further and assess the claim of privilege authorized by the Order to determine whether it is valid.<br><br>While the validity of claims of privilege must be assessed on a case to case basis, examining the ground invoked therefor and the particular circumstances surrounding it, there is, in an implied claim of privilege, a defect that renders it invalid <span style="font-style: italic;">per se.</span>  By its very nature, and as demonstrated by the letter of respondent Executive Secretary quoted above, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the implied claim authorized by Section 3 of E.O. 464 is not accompanied by any specific allegation of the basis thereof </span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., whether the information demanded involves military or diplomatic secrets, closed-door Cabinet meetings, etc.).  While Section 2(a) enumerates the types of information that are covered by the privilege under the challenged order, Congress is left to speculate as to which among them is being referred to by the executive.  The enumeration is not even intended to be comprehensive, but a mere statement of what is<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> included</span> in the phrase "confidential or classified information between the President and the public officers covered by this executive order."<br><br>Certainly, Congress has the right to know why the executive considers the  requested information privileged.  It does not suffice to merely declare that the President, or an authorized head of office, has determined that it is so, and that the President has not overturned that determination.  Such declaration leaves Congress in the dark on how the requested information could be classified as privileged. That the message is couched in terms that, on first impression, do not seem like a claim of privilege only makes it more pernicious.  It threatens to make Congress doubly blind to the question of why the executive branch is not providing it with the information that it has requested.<br><br>A claim of privilege, being a claim of exemption from an obligation to disclose information, must, therefore, be clearly asserted.  As <span style="font-style: italic;">U.S. v. Reynolds </span>teaches:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The privilege belongs to the government and must be </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">asserted </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">by it</span>; it can neither be claimed nor waived by a private party.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not to be lightly invoked.  There must be a formal claim of privilege</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">, </span>lodged by the head of the department which has control over the matter, after actual personal consideration by that officer.  The court itself must determine whether the circumstances are appropriate for the claim of privilege, and yet do so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the privilege is designed to protect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Absent then a statement of the specific basis of a claim of executive privilege, there is no way of determining whether it falls under one of the traditional privileges, or whether, given the circumstances in which it is made, it should be respected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>  These, in substance, were the same criteria in assessing the claim of privilege asserted against the Ombudsman in <span style="font-style: italic;">Almonte v. Vasquez</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> and, more in point, against a committee of the Senate  in Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v.

Sheraton Corp. of America</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> amplifies, thus:<br><blockquote>A formal and proper claim of executive privilege requires a specific designation and description of the documents within its scope as<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> well as <span style="font-weight: bold;">precise and certain reasons for preserving their confidentiality.</span>  Without this specificity, it is impossible for a court to analyze the claim short of disclosure of the very thing sought to be protected.</span>  As the affidavit now stands, the Court has little more than its sua sponte speculation with which to weigh the applicability of the claim.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">An improperly asserted claim of privilege is no claim of privilege</span>.  Therefore, despite the fact that a claim was made by the proper executive as <span style="font-style: italic;">Reynolds</span> requires, the Court can not recognize the claim in the instant case because it is legally insufficient to allow the Court to make a just and reasonable determination as to its applicability.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">To recognize such a broad claim in which the Defendant has given no precise or compelling reasons to shield these documents from outside scrutiny, would make a farce of the whole procedure</span>.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Due respect for a co-equal branch of government, moreover, demands no less than a claim of privilege clearly stating the grounds therefor.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Apropos</span> is the following ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">McPhaul v. U.S:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><blockquote>We think the Court's decision in United States v. Bryan, 339 U.S. 323, 70 S. Ct. 724, is highly relevant to these questions.  For it is as true here as it was there, that "if (petitioner) had legitimate reasons for failing to produce the records of the association,<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> a decent respect for the House of Representatives, by whose authority the subpoenas issued, would have required that (he) state (his) reasons for noncompliance upon the return of the writ.</span>  Such a statement would have given the Subcommittee an opportunity to avoid the blocking of its inquiry by taking other appropriate steps to obtain the records. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">"To deny the Committee the opportunity to consider the objection or remedy is in itself a contempt of its authority and an obstruction of its processes.</span>  His failure to make any such statement was "a patent evasion of the duty of one summoned to produce papers before a congressional committee[, and] cannot be condoned." (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Upon the other hand, Congress must not require the executive to state the reasons for the claim with such particularity as to compel disclosure of the information which the privilege is meant to protect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>  A useful analogy in determining the requisite degree of particularity would be the privilege against self-incrimination.  Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hoffman v. U.S</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> declares:<br><blockquote>The witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he would incriminate himself - <span style="font-weight: bold;">his say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination. It is for the court to say whether his silence is justified, and to require him to answer if "it clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken.</span>"  However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the witness, upon interposing his claim, were required to prove the hazard in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be established in court, he would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee. <span style="font-weight: bold;"> To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span>" x x x  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The claim of privilege under Section 3 of E.O. 464 in relation to Section 2(b) is thus <span style="font-weight: bold;">invalid <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span></span>.  It is not asserted.  It is merely implied.  Instead of  providing precise and certain reasons for the claim, it merely invokes E.O. 464, coupled with an announcement that the President has not given her consent.  It is woefully insufficient for Congress to determine whether the withholding of information is justified under the circumstances of each case.  It severely frustrates the power of inquiry of Congress.<br><br>In fine, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Section 3 and Section 2(b) of E.O. 464 must be invalidated.</span><br></div><br>No infirmity, however, can be imputed to Section 2(a) as it merely provides guidelines, binding only on the heads of office mentioned in Section 2(b), on what is covered by executive privilege. It does not purport to be conclusive on the other branches of government.  It may thus be construed as a mere expression of opinion by the President regarding the nature and scope of executive privilege.<br><br>Petitioners, however, assert as another ground for invalidating the challenged order the alleged unlawful delegation of authority to the heads of offices in Section 2(b).  Petitioner Senate of the Philippines, in particular, cites the case of the United States where, so it claims, only the President can assert executive privilege to withhold information from Congress.<br><br>Section 2(b) in relation to Section 3 virtually provides that, once the head of office determines that a certain information is privileged, such determination is presumed to bear the President's authority and has the effect of prohibiting the official from appearing before Congress, subject only to the express pronouncement of the President that it is allowing the appearance of such official.  These provisions thus allow the President to authorize claims of privilege by mere silence.<br><br>Such presumptive authorization, however, is contrary to the exceptional nature of the privilege.  Executive privilege, as already discussed, is recognized with respect to information the confidential nature of which is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crucial</span> to the fulfillment of the unique role and responsibilities of the executive branch,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> or in those instances where exemption from disclosure is necessary to the discharge of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly important</span> executive responsibilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>  The doctrine of executive privilege is thus premised on the fact that certain informations must,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> as a matter of necessity,</span> be kept confidential in pursuit of the public interest.  The privilege being, by definition, an exemption from the obligation to disclose information, in this case to Congress, the necessity must be of such high degree as to outweigh the public interest in enforcing that obligation in a particular case.<br><br>In light of this highly exceptional nature of the privilege, the Court finds it essential to limit to the President the power to invoke the privilege.  She may of course authorize the Executive Secretary to invoke the privilege on her behalf, in which case the Executive Secretary must state that the authority is "By order of the President," which means that he personally consulted with her.  The privilege being an extraordinary power, it must be wielded only by the highest official in the executive hierarchy.  In other words, the President may not authorize her subordinates to exercise such power.  There is even less reason to uphold such authorization in the instant case where the authorization is not explicit but by mere silence.  Section 3, in relation to Section 2(b), is further invalid on this score.<br><br>It follows, therefore, that when an official is being summoned by Congress on a matter which, in his own judgment, might be covered by executive privilege, he must be afforded reasonable time to inform the President or the Executive Secretary of the possible need for invoking the privilege.  This is necessary in order to provide the President or the Executive Secretary with fair opportunity to consider whether the matter indeed calls for a claim of executive privilege.  If, after the lapse of that reasonable time, neither the President nor the Executive Secretary invokes the privilege, Congress is no longer bound to respect the failure of the official to appear before Congress and may then opt to avail of the necessary legal means to compel his appearance.<br><br>The Court notes that one of the expressed purposes for requiring officials to secure the consent of the President under Section 3 of E.O. 464 is to ensure "respect for the rights of public officials appearing in inquiries in aid of legislation."  That such rights must indeed be respected by Congress is an echo from Article VI Section 21 of the Constitution mandating that "[t]he rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries shall be respected."<br><br>In light of the above discussion of Section 3, it is clear that it is essentially an authorization for implied claims of executive privilege, for which reason it must be invalidated. That such authorization is partly motivated by the need to ensure respect for such officials does not change the infirm nature of the authorization itself.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right to Information</span><br><br>E.O 464 is concerned only with the demands of Congress for the appearance of executive officials in the hearings conducted by it, and not with the demands of citizens for information pursuant to their right to information on matters of public concern.  Petitioners are not amiss in claiming, however, that what is involved in the present controversy is not merely the legislative power of inquiry, but the right of the people to information.<br><br>There are, it bears noting, clear distinctions between the right of Congress to information which underlies the power of inquiry and the right of the people to information on matters of public concern.  For one, the demand of a citizen for the production of documents pursuant to his right to information does not have the same obligatory force as a <span style="font-style: italic;">subpoena duces tecum</span> issued by Congress.  Neither does the right to information grant a citizen the power to exact testimony from government officials.  These powers belong only to Congress and not to an individual citizen.<br><br>Thus, while Congress is composed of representatives elected by the people, it does not follow, except in a highly qualified sense, that in every exercise of its power of inquiry, the people are exercising their right to information.<br><br>To the extent that investigations in aid of legislation are generally conducted in public, however, any executive issuance tending to unduly limit disclosures of information in such investigations necessarily deprives the people of information which, being presumed to be in aid of legislation, is presumed to be a matter of public concern.  The citizens are thereby denied access to information which they can use in formulating their own opinions on the matter before Congress - opinions which they can then communicate to their representatives and other government officials through the various legal means allowed by their freedom of expression.  Thus holds <span style="font-style: italic;">Valmonte v. Belmonte:</span><br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is in the interest of the State that the channels for free political discussion be maintained to the end that the government may perceive and be responsive to the people's will.  Yet, this open dialogue can be effective only to the extent that the citizenry is informed and thus able to formulate its will intelligently. </span> Only when the participants in the discussion are aware of the issues and have access to information relating thereto can such bear fruit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The impairment of the right of the people to information as a consequence of E.O. 464 is, therefore, in the sense explained above, just as direct as its violation of the legislature's power of inquiry.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Implementation of E.O. 464 prior to its publication</span><br><br>While E.O. 464 applies only to officials of the executive branch, it does not follow that the same is exempt from the need for publication.  On the need for publishing even those statutes that do not directly apply to people in general,<span style="font-style: italic;"> Tañada v. Tuvera </span>states:<br><blockquote>The term "laws" should refer to all laws and not only to those of general application, for strictly speaking all laws relate to the people in general albeit there are some that do not apply to them directly.  An example is a law granting citizenship to a particular individual, like a relative of President Marcos who was decreed instant naturalization.  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It surely cannot be said that such a law does not affect the public although it unquestionably does not apply directly to all the people.  The subject of such law is a matter of public interest which any member of the body politic may question</span> i<span style="text-decoration: underline;">n the political forums or, if he is a proper party, even in courts of justice.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Although the above statement was made in reference to statutes, logic dictates that the challenged order must be covered by the publication requirement.  As explained above, E.O. 464 has a direct effect on the right of the people to information on matters of public concern.  It is, therefore, a matter of public interest which members of the body politic may question before this Court.  Due process thus requires that the people should have been apprised of this issuance before it was implemented.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span><br><br>Congress undoubtedly has a right to information from the executive branch whenever it is sought in aid of legislation.  If the executive branch withholds such information on the ground that it is privileged, it must so assert it and state the reason therefor and why it must be respected.<br><br>The infirm provisions of E.O. 464, however, allow the executive branch to evade congressional requests for information without need of clearly asserting a right to do so and/or proffering its reasons therefor.  By the mere expedient of invoking said provisions, the power of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation is frustrated. That is impermissible. For<br><blockquote>[w]hat republican theory did accomplish-was to reverse the old presumption in favor of secrecy, based on the divine right of kings and nobles, and replace it with a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">presumption in favor of publicity</span>, based on the doctrine of popular sovereignty.
