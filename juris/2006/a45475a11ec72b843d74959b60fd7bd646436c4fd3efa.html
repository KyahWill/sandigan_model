Her parents and her sister Corazon Bernadette sent her money from Canada once or twice a month to support her and her daughters.&nbsp; It was her father who spent for the education of her daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; She was married to Crispin Abuan, a policeman, but they separated in 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; She did not know any person by the name of Marissa Gorospe.&nbsp; She did not work for Avon Cosmetics nor used any of its products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>At around 8:30 a.m. on May 6, 1998, she was with her two daughters, 21-year old Ediliza Go and 9-year old Mae Liza Abuan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; They were still in bed inside their room. &nbsp;Suddenly, four armed men barged into their house and declared a raid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; About eight to ten others were outside her house.&nbsp; She inquired if they had a search warrant but she was not shown any.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The men searched her house for about 10 to 15 minutes and turned up with nothing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> &nbsp;Some of the men went out of the house and boarded a jeepney. &nbsp;The men outside again went into the bedroom and came out with "powder placed in a plastic."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> &nbsp;At this instance, <i>Barangay</i> Captain Bernardo Mangaliag was brought to the scene and was shown the "powder substance" recovered from her bedroom. &nbsp;She refused to sign the inventory and receipt of the property seized and the certification of orderly search.&nbsp; However, Mangaliag signed the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>She declared that the sachets/substances which the policemen claimed to have found in her house were merely "planted" to implicate her.&nbsp; The raid as well as the charge against her were instigated by her brother Arsenio Tana, who was enraged when she refused his demand to entrust the properties of the family to the care of his son. &nbsp;It appears that Tana carried out his threat to have her house raided since the policemen did come to her house on May 6, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; Her brother was by the gate of her house at the time of the raid.<br><br>Abuan also testified that, during the raid, she saw Tana talking to the police officers who arrested her.&nbsp; Abuan also declared that the money kept inside a box in her room amounting to P25,000.00 (US$1,100.00) given by her sister Corazon Bernardino had gone missing after the raid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; She did not file any charge for the loss of her money because she was scared. &nbsp;She did not know who took it.<br><br><i>Barangay</i> Captain Robert Calachan of <i>Barangay</i> Sapang, Manaoag, Pangasinan and Mercedes Carvajal, an employee of Avon Cosmetics in Dagupan holding the position of team leader, testified for accused.<br><br>Calachan declared that he was born in <i>Barangay</i> Sapang and never left the place.&nbsp; He was familiar with the residents of the small <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>&nbsp; He issued a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> stating that "as per record of this <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span>, a certain Marissa Gorospe is not a resident of this <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span>."&nbsp; Before he signed the certification, he inquired from the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay</span> members if they knew a Marissa Gorospe, and he was told that no one by that name was a transient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Carvajal, for her part, testified that, based on the certification dated November 12, 1998 of Dagupan City Avon Branch Manager Gigi dela Rosa, "Marissa Gorospe is not a registered dealer of Avon Dagupan Branch based on our records."&nbsp; She did not know any Avon Cosmetics employee or dealer named Marissa Gorospe in Pangasinan. &nbsp;She further testified that she had been a team leader/dealer of Avon Cosmetics for 21 years already, and that Abuan was not such a dealer/employee.&nbsp; On cross-examination, she declared that she was a team leader of Avon Cosmetics (Dagupan Branch), and thus had no participation in the preparation of the certification of Gigi dela Rosa and was not in a position to know if the certification was correct.<br><br>On March 28, 2001, the trial court rendered a decision finding accused guilty of the charge. &nbsp;The dispositive portion reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of a violation of Section 15 (sic), Article 6425, she is hereby sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY to FOUR (4) YEARS and TWO (2) MONTHS of PRISION CORRECTIONAL.<br><br>The prohibited drug and paraphernalia seized from the accused are hereby confiscated in favor of the government and should be turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board for disposition in accordance with law.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>The trial court declared that the testimonies of police officers Gamboa and de Vera should be accorded great weight and credence as they testified positively regarding what transpired during the raid.&nbsp; In contrast, the testimony of accused was self-serving, negative and feeble.&nbsp; She failed to prove that it was her brother who manipulated the unfortunate events. &nbsp;Neither was she able to prove ill motive on the part of the police officers who conducted a search in her house; hence, the presumption is that they regularly performed their duties.&nbsp; The failure of the accused to present her two daughters as witnesses amounted to suppression of evidence, giving rise to the presumption that if they had been presented, their testimonies would be adverse to her.<br><br>On the issue of the validity of the search warrant, the court ruled that there was probable cause for its issuance. &nbsp;The proceedings conducted by the Execute Judge relative to the application of the police for a search warrant, its issuance and implementation were valid, regular, and in accordance with the requirements of the law and Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; The trial court declared that Gorospe may have lied about her address and being a dealer of Avon Cosmetics; however, it does not necessarily mean that she was a fictitious person.&nbsp; It explained that Gorospe may have lied "a little" in order to conceal herself for her protection, but the rest of her testimony constituted sufficient evidence of probable cause.<br><br>Abuan filed her motion for reconsideration dated April 16, 2001, which the court denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated May 10, 2001.&nbsp; She appealed the decision to the CA, where she averred that:<blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE ALLEGED SHABU AND OTHER PARAPHERNALIA AS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED THEREBY DISREGARDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROHOBITION AGAINST "FRUITS" OF THE POISONOUS TREE.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED AND GRAVELY MISAPPRECIATED THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THE ACCUSED WHEN IT OVERLOOKED THE GLARING DISCREPANCIES IN THE TESTIMONIES OF THE SUPPOSED EYEWITNESSES.</blockquote>Abuan insisted that the applicant failed to show probable cause for the issuance of Search Warrant No. 98-62.&nbsp; "Marissa Gorospe" is a fictitious person whose alleged testimony is fabricated and was used by the police officers to convince the Executive Judge that there was probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant when, in fact, there was none.&nbsp; The Executive Judge failed to ask Gorospe searching questions.&nbsp; Consequently, Search Warrant No. 98-62 is void and the substances and paraphernalia confiscated by the policemen are inadmissible in evidence.&nbsp; She further claimed that the testimonies of De Vera and Gamboa were pockmarked with inconsistencies and as such, the trial court should not have given them probative weight.<br><br>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) averred that the trial court merely confirmed Executive Judge Ramos' finding of probable cause.&nbsp; Besides, appellant failed to file a motion to quash Search Warrant No. 98-62, hence, was estopped from assailing it and the search and seizure conducted thereafter.&nbsp; The OSG cited the ruling of this Court in <i>Demaisip v. Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; It likewise claimed that the inconsistencies adverted to by appellant pertained merely to collateral matters and were not determinative of her guilt or innocence.&nbsp; As gleaned from the evidence of the prosecution, her defenses could not prevail over the evidence adduced by the prosecution.<br><br>The CA rendered judgment affirming the RTC decision. &nbsp;The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, for lack of merit, the appeal is DISMISSED. The assailed Decision dated March 28, 1001 in Criminal Case No. 98-02337-D of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 41, Dagupan City convicting Eliza T. Abuan of violation of Section 16, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, is AFFIRMED. Costs against the accused-appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote>The appellate court ruled that the prosecution adduced proof beyond reasonable doubt of Abuan's guilt for the crime charged.&nbsp; The alleged discrepancies in the testimonies of Gamboa and de Vera were peripheral matters.&nbsp; Moreover, Abuan's failure to assail the legality of the search and seizure conducted by the policemen before her arraignment was equivalent to a waiver of her right to assail the search warrant.&nbsp; The CA cited the ruling of this Court in <i>Malaloan v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Abuan filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> reiterating her argument that the search warrant is not valid. &nbsp;She also argued that she did not waive her right to assail the validity of the search warrant at her arraignment and during the trial.&nbsp; She maintained that the CA should not rely on the evaluation by the RTC of the witnesses' credibility, and that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were on material relevant details.<br><br>The appellate court denied the motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> dated May 26, 2005 on its finding that no new and substantial matter was presented to warrant reconsideration thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the instant petition, Abuan, now petitioner, asserts that<blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE SEARCH WARRANT VALID DESPITE FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS MANDATED BY THE CONSTITUTION.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE CA ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE ISSUE OF THE VALIDITY OF THE SEARCH WARRANT WAS DEEMED WAIVED AFTER ARRAIGNMENT.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE CA ERRED IN CONSIDERING THE SHABU AND OTHER PARAPHERNALIA ALLEGEDLY TAKEN FROM THE PETITIONER AS ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE CA ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE CONVICTION OF THE PETITIONER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner avers that the search warrant issued by the Executive Judge was void because the circumstances leading to its issuance were not based on probable cause but on mere fabrications. &nbsp;She points out that according to Gorospe, she became acquainted with petitioner and visited her in her house because of their employment with Avon Cosmetics. &nbsp;However, considering that she and Gorospe were never employed by Avon Cosmetics and were not even acquainted, such testimony is false.&nbsp; Thus, the search warrant should be declared invalid as it is based on the testimony of a fictitious person, a "planted witness" with a fabricated testimony and, consequently, any evidence discovered on the basis thereof should be suppressed and excluded in accordance with Section 3(2), Article III of the Constitution.&nbsp; Petitioner points out that with the inadmissibility of the <i>shabu</i> and other paraphernalia, the appellate court should have acquitted her of the charges by reason of the prosecution's failure to prove the commission of the crime beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Petitioner insists that, based on the records, she sought to suppress the search warrant throughout the entire proceedings in the trial court.&nbsp; She rejected the prosecution's offer to admit the validity of the search warrant and even filed a motion to suppress the search.&nbsp; She was thus not proscribed from filing her motion to suppress the search warrant even after the arraignment.<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the OSG maintains that the search warrant is valid. &nbsp;It insists that the CA correctly ruled that the requisites of a valid search warrant were present, noting that the Executive Judge conducted searching questions and answers on the person of Marissa Gorospe. &nbsp;It asserts that, in applying for a search warrant, a police officer need not possess personal knowledge regarding an illegal activity;
