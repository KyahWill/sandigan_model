Hence, spawned the administrative complaint at bar, alleging that respondent, acting in collusion with his clients Johnny and Manuel Rodil, "frustrated" the implementation of the Writ of Execution by presenting before the Labor Arbiter the spurious documents.<br><br>In a related move, complainants also filed a criminal complaint for Falsification against respondent, together with his clients Johnny and Manuel Rodil, before the Prosecutor's Office of Quezon City where it was docketed as I.S.

Hababag, who conducted an investigation of the administrative complaint at bar, recommended that respondent be faulted for negligence and that he be reprimanded therefor with warning, in light of his following discussion:<br><blockquote>The issue to be resolved is <u>whether or not respondent can be disbarred</u> for his alleged manipulation of four alleged RELEASE WAIVER AND QUITCLAIM by herein complainants who subsequently disclaimed the same as bogus and falsified.<br><br>A lawyer takes an oath when he is admitted to the Bar. By doing so he thereby becomes an Officer of the Court on whose shoulders rests the grave responsibility of assisting the courts in the proper, fair, speedy and efficient administration of justice.<br><br>Mindful of the fact that the present proceedings involve, on the one hand, the right of a litigant to seek redress against a member of the Bar who has, allegedly caused him damaged, either through malice or negligence, while in the performance of his duties as his counsel, and, on the other, the right of that member of the Bar to protect and preserve his good name and reputation, we have again gone over and considered [the] aspects of the case.<br><br><u>All the cases protesting and contesting the genuineness, veracity and due execution</u> of the questioned RELEASE WAIVER AND QUITCLAIM namely: Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Recall, Appeal and Falsification are <u><b>PENDING</b> resolution in their respective venues. Arbiter Ariel Cadiente Santos, who was supposed to know the identities of the herein complainants <b>is not impleaded</b> by the complainants when it was his solemn duty and obligation to ascertain true and real identities of person executing Release Waiver with Quitclaim.</u><br><br>The old adage that in the performance of an official duty there is that presumption of regularity unless proven otherwise, such was proven in the January 28, 2005 clarificatory questioning . . . :<br><br>x x x x<br><br>. . . <u><b>In the case at bar, the question of whether or not respondent actually committed the despicable act would seem to be fairly debatable under the circumstances</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9] </sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>The Board of Governors of the IBP, by Resolution No. XVII-2005-226, approved and adopted the Report and Recommendation of Commissioner Hababag.<br><br>After the records of the case were forwarded to the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC), the Director for Bar Discipline of the IBP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> transmitted additional records including a <i>Motion to Amend the Resolution No. XVII-2005-226</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup> filed by respondent.<br><br>One of the complainants, Renerio Sambajon (Sambajon), by Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [12]</sup> filed before the OBC, assailed the IBP Board Resolution.  The Petition was filed three days after the 15-day period to assail the IBP Resolution.  Sambajon explains that while his counsel received the Resolution on February 27, 2006, he only learned of it when he visited on March 16, 2006 his counsel who could not reach him, he (Sambajon) having transferred from one residence to another.<br><br>Giving Sambajon the benefit of the doubt behind the reason for the     3-day delay in filing the present petition, in the interest of justice, this Court gives his petition due course.<br><br>In respondent's Motion to Amend the IBP Board Resolution, he does not deny that those whom he met face to face before Commissioner Hababag were not the same persons whom he saw before Labor Arbiter Santos on February 27, 2004. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  He hastens to add though that he was not familiar with the complainants as they were not attending the hearings before Arbiter Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Complainants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and their former counsel Atty.

But respondent himself had the same responsibility.  He was under obligation to protect his clients' interest, especially given the amount allegedly given by them in consideration of the execution of the documents.  His answers to the clarificatory questions of Commissioner Hababag do not, however, show that he discharged such obligation.<br><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>But is it not a fact [that it is] also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your duty to ask.. that the money of your client would go to the deserving employee</span>?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><u>I did not do that anymore</u>, Your Honor, <u>because there was already as you call it before a precedent</u> in February of 1998 when my client directly made settlement to the nine or eight of the seventeen original complainants, Your Honor, and <u>I did not participate</u>. Hindi po ako nakialam don sa kanilang usapan because it is my belief that the best way, Your Honor, to have a dispute settled between the parties is that we let them do the discussion, we'll let them do the settlement because sometimes you know, Your Honor, sad to say, when lawyers are involved in a matters [sic] of settlement the dispute does not terminate as in this case, Your Honor.</blockquote></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x  x x<br></div><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Yes. What made you appear on said date and time before Arbiter Santos?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I was called by my client to go to the office of Arbiter Santos, <u>number one, <b>to witness the signing</b> of the documents of Quitclaim and Waiver; number 2, so that according to them someone as a lawyer will represent them in that proceedings</u>.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>My query, did it not surprise you that <u>no money was given to you and yet there would be a signing of Quitclaim Receipt and Release</u>?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I am not, your Honor, because <u>it happened before and there  were no complaints</u>, Your Honor.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote>Just because it happened before you did not bother to see to it that there is a voucher so <u>you just rely on your precedent</u>, is that what you mean?</blockquote><br><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><u>Yes, Your Honor, because I always believe that the parties       who are talking and it is my client who knows them better than I do</u>, Your Honor.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>So, <u>you just followed the instruction of your client to be present at Arbiter Cadiente Santos office because there would be signing of Quitclaim Receipt and Release</u>, it that clear?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><u><b>[You] [d]id not bother to ask your client where is the money intended for the payment of these workers</b></u>?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><u>I did not ask.</u></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>You did not asked [<i>sic</i>] your client who will prepare the documents?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>As far as the documents are concerned, Your Honor.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:<br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The Quitclaim Receipt and Release?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Yes, Your Honor, I remember this. They asked me before    February of 1998.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:<br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>When you say they whom are you referring to?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I'm referring to my client, Your Honor.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><u>They asked me attorney can you please prepare us a document of Quitclaim and Waiver or give us a simple [sic] of Quitclaim and Waiver</u>. I do recall that <u>I made one but this document, Your  Honor, is only a single document</u> where all the signatories named are present because my purpose there really, Your Honor, is that so that each of them will be there together and they will identify themselves, see each other para ho siguradong sila-sila yong magkakasama at magkakakilanlan. x x x x And <u>when the signing took place in February of 2004 it was made for any [sic] individual, Your Honor, <b>no longer the  document that I prepared when all of the seven will be signing in one document</b></u>.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM.

SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><u>I did not anymore because, Your Honor, at the time when I was there, there are already people there, the seven complainants plus another woman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</u></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>The Code of Professional Responsibility provides:<br><br>CANON 17 - A LAWYER OWES FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT AND HE SHALL BE MINDFUL OF THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM.<br><br>CANON 18 -  A LAWYER SHALL SERVE HIS CLIENT WITH COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Rule 18.03 -  A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable.</blockquote>To be sure, respondent's client Manuel Rodil did not request him to go to the Office of Labor Arbiter Cadiente to be a mere passive witness to the signing of the Release Waiver and Quitclaims. That he was requested to go there could only mean that he would exert vigilance to protect his clients' interest. This he conceded when he acknowledged the purpose of his presence at the Office of Labor Arbiter Santos, thus:<br><blockquote>ATTY. SUING:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>To go there, Your Honor, and represent them and <u>see that these document[s] are properly signed and <b>that these people are properly identified</b> and verified them in front of Arbiter Ariel Cadiente Santos</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>That there was an alleged precedent in 1998 when a group of complainants entered into a compromise agreement with his clients in which he "did not participate" and from which no problem arose did not excuse him from carrying out the admitted purpose of going to the Labor Arbiter's   office - "that [the complainants] are properly identified . . . in front of [the] Arbiter."<br><br>Besides, by respondent's own information, Labor Arbiter Santos was entertaining doubts on the true identity of those who executed the Release Waiver and Quitclaims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [20]</sup> That should have alerted him to especially exercise the diligence of a lawyer to protect his clients' interest.   But he was not and he did not.<br><blockquote>Diligence is "the attention and care required of a person in a given situation and is the opposite of negligence." A lawyer serves his client with diligence by adopting that norm of practice expected of men of good intentions. He thus owes entire devotion to the interest of his client, warm zeal in the defense and maintenance of his rights, and the exertion of his utmost learning, skill, and ability to ensure that nothing shall be taken or withheld from him, save by the rules of law legally applied. It is axiomatic in the practice of law that the price of success is eternal diligence to the cause of the client.<br><br>The practice of law does not require extraordinary diligence (<i>exactissima diligentia</i>) or that "extreme measure of care and caution which persons of unusual prudence and circumspection use for securing and preserving their rights. <u>All that is required is ordinary diligence</u> (<i>diligentia</i>) <u>or that degree of vigilance expected of a <i>bonus pater familias</i></u>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>And this Court notes the <i>attempt of respondent to influence the answers of his client</i> Manuel Rodil when the latter testified before Commissioner Manuel Hababag:<br><blockquote>COMM. HABABAG:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>May pinirmahan dito na Quitclaim Receipt and Release. Ito ho ba sinong may gawa nitong Receipt Waiver and Quitclaim?</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>MR. RODIL:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Sila po.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>COMM.

His client contradicted respondent's claim that the Release Waiver and Quitclaim which he (respondent) prepared was not <u>the</u> one presented at the Arbiter's Office, as well as his implied claim that he was not involved in releasing to the complainants the money for and in consideration of the execution of the documents.<br><br>As an officer of the court, a lawyer is called upon to assist in the administration of justice.
