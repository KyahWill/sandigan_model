NOS. 52159-60-R CAN STILL BE ENFORCED BY A SIMPLE MOTION UNDER SEC. 6, RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT<br><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE ATTORNEY'S FEES AWARDED TO PRIVATE RESPONDENT IN CA-G.R. NOS. 52159-60-R [ON JANUARY 17, 1980] CAN BE ENFORCED/SATISFIED AS AGAINST THE PARCELS OF LAND ACQUIRED BY PETITIONER FROM THE ALANOS ON DECEMBER 7, 1973</blockquote><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>We find the petition partly meritorious.<br><br><b>(1) Resort to Certiorari</b><br><br>Petitioner contends that Raquiza's resort to certiorari is erroneous because one of the essential requisites for the issuance of a writ of certiorari is that there must be no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.&nbsp; Petitioner reasoned that since the subject of the petition for certiorari were the orders of the trial court dated January 19 and May 13, 1988, appeal, not certiorari, is the proper remedy.&nbsp; Petitioner further alleged that the petition for certiorari was filed with the CA only in March 1989, after the lapse of more than one year from the assailed orders.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that a writ of certiorari lies when any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his&nbsp; [/her] jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.&nbsp; We have consistently held that where the error sought to be corrected neither relates to the court's jurisdiction nor involves grave abuse of discretion, review [of the error] through certiorari will not be allowed.&nbsp; This rule, however, admits exceptions such as (1) when it is necessary to prevent irreparable damages and injury to a party, (2) where the trial judge capriciously and whimsically exercised his&nbsp; [/her] judgment, (3) where there may be danger of failure of justice, (4) where an appeal would be slow, inadequate, and insufficient, (5) where the issue raised is one purely of law, (6) where public interest is involved, and (7) in case of urgency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Jaca v. Davao Lumber Company</i>, we further ruled that:<blockquote>Although Sec. 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides that the special civil action of certiorari may only be invoked when "there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the [ordinary] course of law," this rule is not without exception. The availability of the ordinary course of appeal does not constitute sufficient ground to prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari where the appeal is not an adequate remedy or equally beneficial, speedy and sufficient. It is the inadequacy - not the mere absence of all other legal remedies and the danger of failure of justice without the writ that must usually determine the propriety of certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote>In this case, while private respondent had other legal remedies against the trial courts' orders, these remedies would be slow, inadequate and insufficient in light of the excessive delay in this case.&nbsp; Private respondent's attempts to collect his fees in 1958 was evident when he intervened in Civil Case Nos. 2608 and 4622.&nbsp; He received a favorable decision after 22 years, or on January 17, 1980, after an appeal to the CA.&nbsp; The Decision became final on July 13, 1981.&nbsp; Since then private respondent had been trying to execute the decision by filing various motions.&nbsp; The trial court, however, frustrated private respondent's efforts when it issued its January 19 and May 13, 1988 Orders. Thereafter, private respondent filed the questioned petition for certiorari and the CA issued its Decision only in 1994.&nbsp; The number of years alone that the private respondent had devoted in enforcing his claim, that is, almost half a century to date, exceptionally calls for certiorari as a more speedy and adequate remedy.&nbsp; The availability of other legal remedies cannot prevent the recourse to certiorari when these remedies would be slow and inadequate to effectively dispense justice in favor of the private respondent.<br><br>We take special cognizance that when the CA issued the questioned Decision in 1994, private respondent Raquiza was almost 90 years old.&nbsp; Private respondent had once appealed the case which resulted in a Decision in his favor after ten years of pendency in the appellate court.&nbsp; Considering the private respondent's age and the slow disposition of his previous appeal, it is easy to understand why he had resorted to certiorari instead of appeal in trying to execute the Decision in his favor.&nbsp; Dismissing the instant petition on the basis of technicality alone would be unjust to private respondent.&nbsp; We reiterate that:<blockquote>Technicalities should be disregarded if only to render to the respective parties that which is their due. Thus, although We have said that certiorari cannot be a substitute for a lapsed appeal, We have, time and again, likewise held that where a rigid application of that rule will result in a manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, the rule may be relaxed.&nbsp; Hence, considering the broader and primordial interests of justice, particularly when there is grave abuse of discretion, thus impelling occasional departure from the general rule that the extraordinary writ of certiorari cannot substitute for a lost appeal, respondent appellate court may legally entertain the special civil action for certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner FMC mistakenly pointed out that private respondent filed the petition for certiorari before the CA in 1989, concluding that more than one year had elapsed from the assailed orders of the trial court dated January 19 and May 13, 1988.&nbsp; As previously mentioned, private respondent initially filed a petition for certiorari on July 25, 1988 which was within the extended period of time granted to him by this Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; On August 15, 1988, the Court remanded the case to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; While the case was pending in the CA, Raquiza asked for an extension of time to file his Amended Petition.&nbsp; The appellate court granted his motion and on March 30, 1989, Raquiza filed the Amended Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, private respondent's Petition for Certiorari was filed within the time set by the rules and with the approval of the Supreme Court and CA.&nbsp; Private respondent, therefore, cannot be said to have slept on his right to appeal for more than a year.<br><br><b>(2) Enforcement of the Decision by Motion</b><br><br>There is no dispute that the judgment sought to be enforced by private respondent was the January 17, 1980 Decision of the CA which became final on July 13, 1981.&nbsp; Petitioner asserts, however, that judgments can be enforced by mere motion within five years from finality and since private respondent's Motion to Enforce the Motion to Execute was filed only on June 10, 1987, said Motion had already prescribed.<br><br>Section 6, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court states:<blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Execution by motion or by independent action</i> - A final and executory judgment or order may be executed on motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry.&nbsp; After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action.&nbsp; The revived judgment may also be enforced by motion within five (5) years from the date of its entry and thereafter by action before it is barred by the statute of limitations.</blockquote>In <i>Lancita v. Magbanua</i>, we held that:<blockquote>In computing the time limited for suing out of an execution, although there is authority to the contrary, the general rule is that there should not be included the time when execution is stayed, either by agreement of the parties for a definite time, by injunction, by the taking of an appeal or writ of error so as to operate as a supersedeas, by the death of a party or otherwise. Any interruption or delay occasioned by the debtor will extend the time within which the writ may be issued without <i>scire facias </i>(citation omitted).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></blockquote>As pointed above, in computing the time limited for suing out an execution, the time during which execution is stayed should be excluded, and the said time will be extended by any delay occasioned by the debtor.&nbsp; In <i>Blouse Potenciano v. Mariano</i>, we held that the motion for examination of the judgment debtor, which is a proceeding supplementary to execution, and the action for mandamus amounted to a stay of execution which effectively interrupted or suspended the five (5)-year period for enforcing the judgment by motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Camacho v. Court of Appeals, et. al.</i>, where after a final judgment, the petitioner (obligor) moved to defer the execution, elevated the matter to the CA and the Supreme Court, transferred the property to her daughter, in addition to the issues regarding counsel and subsequent vacancies in the courts, we ruled that:<blockquote>Under the peculiar circumstances of the present case where the <i>delays were occasioned by petitioner's own initiatives and for her advantage as well as beyond the respondents' control</i>, we hold that the five <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[5]</span>-year period allowed for the enforcement of the judgment by motion was deemed to have been effectively interrupted or suspended.&nbsp; Once again we rely upon basic notions of equity and justice in so ruling.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br>The purpose of the law in prescribing time limitations for enforcing judgment or actions is to prevent obligors from sleeping on their rights.&nbsp; Far from sleeping on their rights, respondents persistently pursued their rights of action.&nbsp; It is revolting to the conscience to allow petitioner to further avert the satisfaction of her obligation because of sheer literal adherence to technicality (citation omitted).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote>We also subtracted from the five (5)-year period the time when the judgment could not be enforced due to the restraining order issued by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and when the records of the case were lost or misplaced through no fault of the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Provincial Government of Sorsogon v. Vda. de Villaroya</i>, we likewise excluded the delays caused by the auditor's requirements which were&nbsp; not the fault of the parties who sought execution, and ruled that "[i]n the eight years that elapsed from the time the judgment became final until the filing of the restraining motion by the private respondents, the judgment never became dormant.&nbsp; Section 6, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court does not apply."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Jacinto v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>, this Court further held:<blockquote>Granting for the sake of argument that the motion for an alias writ of execution was beyond the five <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[5]</span>-year limitation within which a judgment may be executed by mere motion, still under the circumstances prevailing wherein all the delay in the execution of the judgment lasting for more than eight <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">[8]</span>-years was <i>beneficial</i> to private respondents, this Court[,] for reasons of equity[,] is constrained to treat the motion for execution as having been filed within the reglementary period required by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i> summed it up as follows:<blockquote>To be sure, there had been many instances where this Court allowed execution by motion even after the lapse of five years, upon meritorious grounds.&nbsp; These exceptions have one common denominator, and that is: <i>the delay is caused or occasioned by actions of the judgment debtor and/or is incurred for his benefit or advantage</i> (emphasis supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote>In the case at bar, since the judgment of the CA became final on July 13, 1981, private respondent had filed several motions for and in support of its execution.&nbsp; After the dismissal of the appeal of Trans-Resource Management Corporation in 1985, private respondent moved for the inclusion of the Las Piñas property in the order of execution.&nbsp; He reasoned that the February 10, 1982 Writ of Execution could not be enforced against the Las Piñas property because the title number was already changed and could not be traced or found in the Register of Deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, during the five (5) year period from the finality of judgment, private respondent filed several motions for and in support of execution.&nbsp; His persistence is manifest in the number of motions, manifestations, oppositions, and memoranda he had filed since the judgment became final on July 13, 1981.&nbsp; He obtained three writs of execution (February 10, 1982; February 5, 1986 and June 6, 1986) and two orders in aid of execution (October 8, 1982 and February 18, 1986) but the alleged loss of the title, incorrect orders, and the subsequent refusal of petitioner FMC to surrender its title prevented the satisfaction of judgment.&nbsp; While the delay was not wholly attributable to FMC, it nevertheless worked to FMC's advantage.&nbsp; FMC's motion for reconsideration of the order of execution prevented the implementation of said order, especially considering that it was filed on July 8, 1986. &nbsp;Said motion effectively suspended the five (5) year prescriptive period which was supposed to expire on July 13, 1986.<br><br>Subsequently, an order quashing the writ of execution was issued by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> on September 23, 1986 which private respondent questioned in a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Before the lower court released its Decision, on private respondent's motion for reconsideration, Raquiza filed the assailed Motion to Enforce the Motion to Execute.&nbsp; In view of the foregoing circumstances and for reasons of equity, we are constrained to treat the Motion to Enforce the Motion to Execute as having been filed within the reglementary period.&nbsp; The purpose of the law in prescribing time limitations for enforcing judgments or actions is to prevent obligors from sleeping on their rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Private respondent, on the contrary, persistently sought the execution of the judgment in his favor.<br><br><b>(3) Satisfaction of Claims Against the Petitioner's Property</b><br><br>Private respondent's claim on the property is based on the January 17, 1980 decision of the CA which awarded him "30% <i>pro indiviso</i> interest in all the properties reconveyed by Campos, Philamgen and Philamlife under the Compromise Agreement of December 28, 1965."&nbsp; One of the properties that was reconveyed to the Alano spouses is the Las Piñas property which is now in dispute.<br><br>Petitioner contends that when it acquired the property, there was neither an attorney's lien at the back of TCT No. 56520 nor a notice of <i>lis pendens</i>; thus, it was in good faith at the time of purchase.&nbsp; Petitioner also asserts that it acquired the property before the CA awarded the attorney's fees against the property in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Nevertheless, the trial court ruled that petitioner should have been alerted by the fact that TCT No. 190712 was in the name of CPJ as nominee and assignee of the Alanos.&nbsp; The appellate court affirmed this finding, adding that the petitioner is bound to recognize the encumbrances including attorney's lien although not inscribed in the title and that petitioner is bound by the judgment even though there was no formal substitution of the parties.&nbsp; The appellate court ruled that petitioner should have exercised the ordinary care expected of a buyer in real estate. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>We <b>DISAGREE</b>.<br><br>The annotation of attorney's lien on TCT No. 56520 was cancelled on January 30, 1959, long before petitioner FMC acquired the property in question, on December 7, 1973.&nbsp; TCT No. 56520 was later cancelled and replaced by TCT No. 190712 in the name of CPJ Corporation.&nbsp; A notice of <i>lis pendens</i> was inscribed on TCT No. 190712 on February 6, 1958&nbsp; by spouses Epifanio J. Alano and Cecilia Alano in view of the pendency of Civil Case No. 4622 entitled <i>Epifanio J. Alano; et al. v. Miguel Campos, et al</i>.&nbsp; On the other hand, respondent Antonio Raquiza did not bother to have his attorney's lien annotated at the back of TCT NO. 190712, to protect his interests in it.&nbsp; This annotation was cancelled on June 19, 1967 by the Alano spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; Private respondent did not cause the reannotation of the attorney's lien and the notice of <i>lis pendens</i> despite the pendency of the two civil cases.&nbsp; Thus, when petitioner bought the property in question on December 7, 1973, the title was free from the attorney's lien and notice of <i>lis pendens</i>.<br><br>Private respondent argued that the reannotation of his claim could not be effected due to the alleged loss of TCT No. 190712 (formerly TCT No. 56520) and its derivatives.&nbsp; This posture does not hold water.&nbsp; The annotation of <i>lis pendens</i> is done on the original certificate of title which is on file with the Register of Deeds.&nbsp; Even conceding that the original TCT No. 190712 was missing, still respondent Raquiza should have filed the notice of <i>lis pendens</i> with the Office of the Register of Deeds so that the latter will be forewarned if a person requests for the transfer of the title which appears to have been misplaced or lost.&nbsp; Another remedy would be to file a motion for preliminary injunction to prevent the Alano spouses from selling the lot subject of TCT No. 190712, and to direct the Register of Deeds not to transfer the title to any third party.&nbsp; Unfortunately, respondent Raquiza failed to undertake the safeguards necessary to protect his attorney's lien.&nbsp; Thus, we hold that petitioner FMC bought the property without notice of any defect in the title.&nbsp; It is therefore a purchaser in good faith and for value.<br><br>In <i>Spouses Po Lam v. Court of Appeals</i>, we held that the filing of a notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> in effect (1) keeps the subject matter of the litigation <i>within the power of the court</i> until the entry of the final judgment so as to prevent the defeat of the latter by successive alienations; and (2) binds the&nbsp; purchaser of the land subject of the litigation to the judgment or decree that will be promulgated there on whether such a purchaser is a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser or not; but (3) does not create a non-existent right or lien.&nbsp; The cancellation of a notice of pendency terminates the effects of such notice; thus, the buyers of the property cannot be considered transferees <i>pendente lite</i> and purchasers in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66] </sup>This ruling holds true for petitioner FMC. Similar to the aforementioned case, petitioner FMC bought the property pending appeal.&nbsp; The title carried no notice of <i>lis pendens</i> and the private respondent did not cause the reannotation of or the attorney's lien.&nbsp; Thus, petitioner FMC could not be considered a transferee <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite</span> and buyer in bad faith.<br><br>Furthermore, private respondent's right over the property is based on the January 17, 1980 Decision of the CA in CA-GR No. 52159-60R which modified the ruling of the lower court by granting the claim of respondent Raquiza for attorney's fees of 30%&nbsp; <i>pro indiviso</i> interest in all the properties reconveyed by Campos, et al.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the sale on December 7, 1973 in favor of petitioner FMC, private respondent Raquiza did not yet have a right over 30% of the Las Piñas property.&nbsp; Had respondent Raquiza been vigilant, he could have impleaded petitioner FMC as a party-litigant in the civil cases.&nbsp; However, it was only in March 1986 when respondent Raquiza asked that petitioner be ordered to surrender its title.&nbsp; By that time, it was already too late.&nbsp; Apparently, private respondent slept on his rights, and verily such inaction should not prejudice an innocent purchaser for value.&nbsp; Having bought the property in good faith, petitioner FMC cannot be considered a transferee <i>pendente lite</i> which could be bound by the 1980 judgment of the appellate court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is <b>GRANTED IN PART</b> and the April 28, 1994 Decision and the October 26, 1994 Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <b>MODIFIED</b>, so that the attorney's fees awarded to petitioner Raquiza in the January 17, 1980 Decision in CA-G.R.
