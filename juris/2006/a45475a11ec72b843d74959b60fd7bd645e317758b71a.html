Ramil.<br><br>There being then no showing or indication that petitioner had a right to the mortgaged property which may be violated by its sale at public auction, the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the prayer for and issuing the writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals Decision of June 18, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and the Resolution of October 6, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> are <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tinga, JJ., concur.<br><br></span><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1] </sup>Order of December 19, 2003, RTC records at 31-32.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> RTC records, p. 61.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> CA <span style="font-style: italic;">rollo</span> at 7-8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id</span>. at 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid.</span><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Id.</span> at 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7] </sup><span style="font-style: italic;">Pacsports Phils., Inc. v.
