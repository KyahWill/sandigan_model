By operation of law, as of October 21, 1972, the subject landholdings were covered by Operation Land Transfer under Presidential Decree No. 27 in view of the fact that the landholdings, subject of this case are tenanted and Juan Griño, Sr. has other landholdings located at Sara, Iloilo with an area of 50.0000 hectares, more or less.   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The conveyance of the 50.0000hectares landholdings in favor of the Development Bank of the Philippinessometime in 1985 has </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">no legal effect</span>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of exempting the tenantedlandholdings from Operation Land Transfer considering that theconveyance happened only in 1985, several years </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">after</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> the subjecting ofthe said properties under the coverage of Operation Land Transfer</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>Petitioners moved to reconsider<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the April 27, 1998 Order of the DAR Regional Director but it was denied by Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of August 18, 1998.<br><br>Petitioners appealed to the DAR Secretary, arguing that the Regional Director erred in:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> . . .

Braganza denied petitioners' appeal:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>The fact that the 50-hectare property was mortgaged to the DBP in 1972 is of no moment in relation to PD 27. The naked title of said property remained with Juan Griño, Sr. and he was still the owner thereof when PD 27 took effect.<br><br>However, we agree with herein applicants-appellants that the reversion of the 50-hectare property to the DBP by way of <span style="font-style: italic;">dacion en pago</span> in 1985 was not done in circumvention of PD 27. Said property was untenanted coconut land, hence, beyond the coverage of PD 27. However, said transaction merely confirmed the fact that  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juan Griño, Sr. was the ownerof the 50-hectare property when PD 27 took effect on 21 October 1972</span>.<br><br>Since Juan Griño, Sr. cannot retain any portion of his tenanted riceland in Leganes, Iloilo, herein applicants-appellants, who are his successors-in-interest, cannot also retain the same property under PD 27. Herein applicants-appellants merely succeeded to the rights of their predecessor-in-interest by virtue of the Law on Succession under the New Civil Code. It should be noted that under DAR AO 4 (1991), no retention rights are granted to the children of landowners.<br><br>Applicants-appellants next assert their right of retention and their right to choose the area to be retained as provided in Section 6 of RA 6657.<br><br>The contention is likewise without merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>The . . . statement of the Supreme Court clearly indicates that a landowner who failed to exercise his retention right of land under PD 27 may do so under RA 6657 provided he is qualified to do so under the regime of PD 27. Stated differently, where a landowner is not entitled to retain land under PD 27, he cannot avail of the right of retention over the same land under RA 6657.<br><br>In the case at hand,      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is established that Juan Griño, Sr. was not entitled toexercise his retention right over subject property under PD 27. As such,he is also not entitled to exercise said right under RA 6657. If Juan Griño,Sr. had no retention rights under PD 27 and RA 6657, it follows that hisheirs, who are his successors-in-interest, cannot also exercise the sameright under PD 27 and RA 6657</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x  (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></div></blockquote>Before the Court of Appeals to which petitioners elevated the case via petition for review, it raised the following arguments:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Griño had the right to retain subject land, because LOI 474 exempted from OLT landowners of ricelands who owned other agricultural lands exceeding 7 hectares if they did not derive sufficient income from the latter.<br><br></li><li>Petitioners had each inherited a 1.33 hectare share of the subject land as of 1985, which was already way below the retention limits of PD 27 and RA 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated October 17, 2003, the appellate court affirmed the September 3, 2002 Order of the DAR Secretary, the pertinent portions of which decision read:<br><blockquote>x x x Juan Griño's disputed land came within the coverage of P.D. 27 because it is tenanted riceland. Because P.D. 27 initially lacked implementing rules and regulations, there were a lot of uncertainties at the start on how the transfer of ownership to tenant-framers would operate. As the above outline of the major post-P.D. 27 developments showed, the government started with the landed estates and worked its way down to seven hectares of tenanted rice and corn land by the time it came out with LOI 474. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What was certain at that point was that from the combined application of P.D. 27 and LOI 474,   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Juan Gri</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">ñ</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">o, Sr. hadno right of retention  because he owned 9 hectares of tenantedriceland and 50 hectares of coconut land</span>.</span> Thus, his tenants were given – in 1981, during the lifetime of Juan Griño, Sr. – their Certificates of Land Transfers preparatory to the Emancipation Patents they would receive if they can perfect their payments of their portion of the covered riceland. Juan Griño, Sr. objected to the issuance of the CLTs soon after. This was the status of Juan Griño, Sr.'s retention rights when he died in 1985.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>While Juan Griño seasonably objected to the CLTs, the objection was simply a pending remedial action passed on to the heirs. <span style="font-weight: bold;">   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This remedialaction lost its efficacy for the heirs when the DAR dismissed thepetition on September 25, 1989 and their heirs failed to appeal thedismissal</span>.</span> x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>Additionally, <span style="font-weight: bold;">when the heirs of Juan Griño, Sr. filed their application for retention under RA 6657 in 1997 they had to contend with an existing adverse ruling by the DAR – the order of September 25, 1989 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and the CLTs the ruling</span> confirmed. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In 1997,</span> the estate of Juan Griño, Sr. could no longer file a petition that would question the denial of Juan Griño, Sr.'s retention rights as <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">res</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">  </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">adjudicata</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had then set in</span>. The DAR was the agency vested by law with the authority to rule on retention issues and its ruling lapsed to finality fifteen  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(15) days after its service. That the ruling has been dulyserved and has reached finality</span> appear to us to be uncontroverted.</span> The DAR ruling is a ruling on the merits of Juan Griño, Sr.'s petition for cancellation of the issued CLTs, and laid to rest any issue of retention as between Juan Griño, Sr. and his successors, and the government. Thus, <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">res adjudicata</span> fully applies.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The estate and the individual heirs are likewise </span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">estopped by laches</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> from questioning the denial of Juan Griño, Sr.'s claim for retention. The denial was made on September 25, 1989 and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heirs' present petition</span>, assuming that it can be characterized as an attack on the denial of Juan Griño, Sr.'s retention rights,  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">was made only onMarch 17, 1997 or 7 ½ years later</span>. At this point, laches has set in, laches being "the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier. </span>x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div><br>In our view, allowing the heirs to resurrect the long entombed issue of retention under the circumstances of this case would not only be a major setback for the government's agrarian reform program, but would be unjust as well to the individual tenants-beneficiaries who are now full-pledged owners of the lands they till. Any adverse ruling against the new owners would be doubly unjust since they were never heard in this present petition.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied;<br>citations omitted)<br></div></blockquote>Petitioners moved to reconsider the appellate court's decision upon the following arguments:<br><blockquote><ol><li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Order of DAR Regional Director Maraya dated September1989</span> purportedly denying Juan Griño, Sr.'s petition for cancellation of CLTs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appeared only in 1998</span>&nbsp; – 6 months after the PARO had declared in the EPs issued in 1997 that no CLTs had been issued.
