Dennis Angeles, filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in the RTC of Cavite for the cancellation of the titles covering the said lots with prayer for damages.&nbsp; He alleged that his brother, through machination, borrowed the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 102248, used the same as collateral for a loan which he secured from the FSLAI, and falsified his (Alejo's)signature on the mortgage contract.&nbsp; Since he was unaware of the mortgage, the monthly amortizations were not paid, and the property was foreclosed by the FSLAI as a consequence.Alejo Aranda further alleged that, as shown in the title covering the property, it could "not be sold or transferred except by hereditary succession or to the government;" thus, the mortgage of the property to the FSLAI, the foreclosure of the real estate mortgage, the sale at public auction to the FSLAI and to the other defendants, as well as the torrens title issued under their names, are null and void.<br><br>Alejo prayed that, after due hearing, judgment be rendered in his favor as follows:<br></supstyle="color:><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that this Honorable Court render judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendants, ordering:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">ON THE PRAYER FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING <br>ORDER/PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION<br></div><ol><li>Issuing a Temporary Restraining Order ex-parts (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) and after due hearing, a Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoining herein defendants or anyone claiming rights under them from further performing any act which would work injustice to herein plaintiff;</li></ol><div style="text-align: center;">ON THE MAIN CAUSE OF ACTION</div><ol><li>Ordering the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. &nbsp;T-363211, T-363213,[and] T-363214 in the name of defendant Sabrino C.

During the December 15, 1993 hearing in Civil Case No.BCV-93-26, plaintiff's counsel, Atty. Dennis Angeles, presented the former counsel of plaintiff, Atty. Franco Loyola, as witness. The latter admitted the genuineness of his and plaintiff's signatures on the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16, and on the compromise agreement which the parties and their counsel submitted to the court for approval. He likewise admitted the due execution of the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>On March 25, 1994, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> granting the motion of the FSLAI to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the action of plaintiff was barred by the decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16.&nbsp; Plaintiff did not appeal the order.<br><br>On January 6, 1995, Alejo, his wife Simeona, and their children, filed a Complaint <i>for annulment of the decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16</i> before the Court of Appeals.The complaint reiterated the material allegations of the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26relative to the nullity of the real estate mortgage in favor of FSLAI, the extrajudicial foreclosure thereof, the sale of the properties covered by the deed, and the torrens titles thereafter issued by the Register of Deeds. &nbsp;It was further alleged that Sabrino Aranda and his wife conspired with FSLAI to forge Alejo's signature on the complaint in Civil Case No.BCV-82-16; Alejo never authorized Atty. Franco Loyola to file the complaint in said case; the signature in the compromise agreement purporting to be his is a forgery; Alejo never appeared nor participated in said case, hence, the proceedings and judgment therein are null and void;and, the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 was dismissed without prejudice.&nbsp; It was likewise prayed that judgment be rendered as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed that, <u>pending final determination of the present case</u>, it is most respectfully prayed that:<br><ol type="a"><li> A temporary restraining order immediately be issued restraining the defendants from committing the acts complained of;<br><br></li><li> After hearing on the petition for preliminary injunction, a writ of preliminary injunction be issued restraining all the defendants from committing the acts complained of;<br></li></ol><u>and after hearing on the merits</u>, judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants in the following tenor:<br><ol><li>Making the writ of injunction permanent;<br><br></li><li>Declaring the mortgage in favor of defendant Bank, and all supporting papers thereto, null and void <i>ab initio</i>;<br><br></li><li>Declaring the Decision dated January 5, 1984, Annex D, in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 and all proceedings before and after rendition of said Decision, null and void <i>ab initio</i> for lack of jurisdiction;<br><br></li><li>Declaring the Order dated March 25, 1994 in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 null and void, or at least without prejudice;<br><br></li><li>Declaring the Extrajudicial Foreclosure proceedings and the Certificate of Sale executed by the defendant Provincial Sheriff against the property of plaintiffs null and void <i>ab initio</i>;<br><br></li><li>Declaring Transfer Certificate of Title Nos.

Franco Loyola in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 taken on December 15, 1993, belied plaintiffs' factual allegations.&nbsp; It also ruled that the action was barred by prescription.<br><br>The Alejo Aranda spouses filed a motion for reconsideration, which the appellate court denied.<supstyle="color: rgb(255="" 0=""><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]<br><br></sup>The Alejo Aranda spouses, through their new counsel, Atty. Jose Alvarez, forthwith filed the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, alleging that the CA erred in ruling as follows:(1) that the RTC had jurisdiction in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16; (2) that their action for the nullification of the decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 had prescribed; and (3)that the dismissal of their complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 was with prejudice.<br><br>Petitioners maintain that they never authorized Atty. Franco Loyola to sign the compromise agreement in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16; in any event, their complaint in Civil Case No.BCV-93-26 was dismissed without any answer having been filed by defendant therein.Considering that the dismissal of the complaint was not on the merits of the case, it was not a bar to their complaint in the CA.&nbsp; They aver that the appellate court should have ordered an investigation on their claim that their counsels, Atty. Franco Loyola and Atty. Dennis Angeles, took advantage of their ignorance and illiteracy, and abandoned their cause.<br><br>In any event, petitioners point out, the trial court dismissed their complaint in Civil Case No.BCV-93-26 on their motion, before any answer was filed; hence, the dismissal of their complaint was without prejudice.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>First. Petitioners Bonifacia Aranda, Pelagia Aranda, Dominador Aranda, Vivencio Aranda, Lolita Aranda, Jeffrey Aranda, and Feliciano Aranda contend that they are the real parties-in-interest in the CA and in this Court, and thus had a cause of action for the nullification of the decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 and for the reversal of the CA decision.They joined their parents, spouses Alejo Aranda and Simeona Joson-Aranda as plaintiffs in the CA, on their claim that they are the "compulsory heirs" of said spouses.&nbsp; However, under the law on succession, "the rights to the succession are transmitted from the moment of death ofthe decedent,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and that "compulsory heirs are called to succeed by operation of law;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as such, petitioners will only become compulsory heirs of their parents upon the death of the latter.<br><br>Second.&nbsp; Petitioners claim that petitioner Alejo Aranda did not secure the services of Atty.Loyola as his counsel in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 and that said counsel forged his (Alejo's)signature in the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16, as well as the one above his typewritten name on page three of the compromise agreement.&nbsp; However, such allegation has been proved to be a complete prevarication by no less than petitioner Alejo Aranda himself, through his former counsel, Atty. Loyola, when the latter testified on December 15, 1993, during the hearing of the motion to withdraw the complaint. &nbsp;The lawyer categorically declared that the signatures in the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 and the compromise agreement in said case were genuine. Moreover, the CA dismissed the petition for the annulment of the decision of the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 based on the testimony of petitioner Alejo Aranda's own witness, Atty. Franco Loyola:</supstyle="color:></supstyle="color:><br> <blockquote> However, the allegations in the petition are not deserving of credence. The petitioners' claim that they never filed nor authorized Atty. Loyola to file the complaint subject of Civil Case No. 82-16, much less the compromise agreement is not believable considering the following circumstances: First, the transcript of stenographic notes taken during the hearing held on December 15, 1993 in Civil Case No. 93-26 (a case admittedly filed by petitioner Alejo Aranda) reveals that petitioner Alejo Aranda himself, through his own counsel, Atty. Dennis Angeles, presented as witness, Atty.

of the hearing held on December 15, 1993, in Civil Case No. 93-26,
clearly belies Alejo Aranda's claim that he did not sign nor authorize
the filing of the complaint in Civil Case No. 82-16, and participated
therein through his former counsel, Atty. Loyola. It is to be noted
that Atty. Loyola was presented as witness by herein petitioner Alejo
Aranda himself through his counsel, Atty.Dennis Angeles, in Civil Case
No. 93-26. Petitioners did not file any Reply to refute thecopy of the
transcript attached to the Comment of respondent bank; hence, it is
deemedadmitted by the petitioners. Secondly, the assailed judgment upon
compromise was renderedon January 5, 1984. Writ of execution was issued
on July 25, 1985 and writ of possession onNovember 20, 1989.&nbsp; Assuming
[that] petitioners did not receive copies of the decision andthe writ
of execution, certainly, they would be aware of the writ of possession
as the samewould have involved a physical transfer of the subject
property by the sheriff to respondentbank. The present petition for
annulment of judgment was filed only on January 6, 1995. Theinordinate
delay in questioning the judgment and seeking its annulment puts in
serious doubtthe veracity of the allegation of fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>Third.
Petitioners' contention that the CA should have ordered the
investigation of Atty.Loyola and Atty. Angeles is anchored on an
erroneous factual premise, namely, that the CA found said counsels to
have committed acts of misconduct to the prejudice of the rights
oftheir client, petitioner Alejo Aranda.&nbsp; However, a careful study of
the CA decision shows thatno such findings were made. The appellate
court merely declared that even assuming the truthof the allegations in
the petition, they merely constitute extrinsic fraud, a ground for
theannulment of the RTC Decision in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16:<br><blockquote>"A
judgment can be annulled on the following grounds: that the judgment is
void for want ofjurisdiction; that the judgment is void for lack of due
process; or that it has beenobtained by fraud." (<i>Regidor v. Court of Appeals</i>, 219 SCRA 530; <i>Ruiz v. Court of Appeals</i>,201
SCRA 577).&nbsp; The allegations in the petition that petitioner Alejo
Aranda never filed norauthorized Atty. Franco Loyola to file the
complaint for annulment of real estate mortgagewhich was docketed as
Civil Case No. 82-16; that the signature in said complaint was
forged,that petitioner Alejo Aranda never appeared nor participated in
the proceedings of said Civil Case No. 82-16; that Alejo Aranda never
authorized the compromise agreement, and that the signature appearing
in said compromise agreement dated December 22, 1983 which
waswrongfully made the basis of the herein assailed judgment upon
compromise dated January 5,1984, was a forgery, could legally
constitute extrinsic fraud that would be a ground forannulment of
judgment. Among the instances of extrinsic or collateral fraud are:
keepingthe unsuccessful party away from court by a false promise of
compromise, or purposelykeeping him in ignorance of the suit; or where
an attorney fraudulently pretends torepresent a party, and connives at
his defeat, or being regularly employed, corruptly sellsout his
client's interest (<i>Magno v. Court of Appeals</i>, 107 SCRA 285, at page 292).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><supstyle="color: rgb(255="" 0="">[33]</supstyle="color:></sup></blockquote>Indeed,
there is no declaration that Atty. Franco Loyola ever committed any act
of misconductas counsel of petitioner Alejo Aranda in Civil Case No.
BCV-82-16.&nbsp; In fact, the CA declaredthat as gleaned from the evidence
of petitioner Alejo Aranda in the RTC in Civil Case No.BCV-93-26, the
signature of Atty. Loyola and petitioner Alejo Aranda in the complaint
in CivilCase No. BCV-82-16 and in the compromise agreement were
genuine.&nbsp; Moreover, petitioner spousesnever bothered to file any
administrative complaint against Atty. Loyola or Atty. Angeles toassert
their claim.<br><br>Fourth.&nbsp;We are convinced that the complaint of
petitioners in the CA assailing the decisionof the RTC in Civil Case
No. BCV-82-16 based on the compromise agreement of the parties ismerely
an afterthought.&nbsp; The records show that the RTC rendered judgment in
Civil Case No.BCV-82-16 as early as January 5, 1984.&nbsp; Based on the
decision of the RTC, the extrajudicialforeclosure of the real estate
mortgage in favor of respondent FSLAI was aborted.&nbsp; In hiscomplaint in
Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 filed on March 8, 1993, petitioner Alejo
Aranda claimedthat the torrens titles to the property were issued to
and under the names of privaterespondents.&nbsp; He must have likewise
discovered that the torrens titles were so issuedfollowing the decision
of the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16, the extrajudicial foreclosureof
the real estate mortgage executed by petitioner spouses Alejo Aranda
with privaterespondents as buyers therein.&nbsp; However, petitioner Alejo
Aranda failed to file a petition forthe annulment of the decision of
the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-82-16 on the ground ofextrinsic fraud;
instead, he filed a complaint for the nullification of said titles
againstprivate respondents herein in the RTC.&nbsp; It was only on January
6, 1995 that petitioners filedtheir complaint in the CA for the
nullification of the decision of the RTC in Civil Case No.BCV-82-16,
following the dismissal of the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26.<br><br>Fifth.&nbsp;Petitioners'
claim that the complaint in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 was dismissed
without prejudice is belied by the records of the case. The Order of
the RTC in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 shows that the complaint was
dismissed based on <i>res judicata</i>:<br><blockquote>Considering
that the plaintiff himself seeks the dismissal of this case and
consideringfurther defendant Fortune Savings and Loan Association,
Inc.'s grounds for seeking thedismissal of this case, particularly that
of <u>res judicata</u>, to be well-founded, this Courthas no alternative but to dismiss this case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, let this case be dismissed.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>An order of the court dismissing the complaint on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>
is anadjudication of the case on the merits although no trial has been
held.&nbsp; Such an order is thusan absolute bar to the filing of a
subsequent action for the same cause between the same parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The
decision referred to in the Order of the RTC which barred the complaint
of petitionerAlejo Aranda in Civil Case No. BCV-93-26 was the Decision
of the RTC in Civil Case No.BCV-82-16.&nbsp; The aforementioned Order of the
trial court thus affirmed the validity of the RTCdecision in Civil Case
No. BCV-82-16.&nbsp; Therein plaintiff Alejo Aranda (now petitioner) did
notappeal the Order.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.&nbsp;Costs against petitioners.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ., </span>concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago, J., </span>on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;
