				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court praying that we (1)  declare the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated August 13, 2002 of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 79, Las Piñas City (MeTC) as null and void; (2) declare the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated February 4, 2003 issued by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 199, Las Piñas City (RTC) as null and void;  and (3)  reverse and set aside the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 16, 2003 of the Court of Appeals (CA).<br><br>The antecedent facts are as follows:<br><br>An ejectment complaint was filed with the MeTC entitled, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Sps.

Jimmy Banting and Sps. Alfred Reyes and Maxima Arceno-Reyes, Defendants"</span> and docketed as Civil Case No. 5663.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  It involved the right to possession of a parcel of land  located at No. 405 Real Street, Talon I, Las Piñas City, containing an area of 258 square meters and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-44306 registered in the name of the Heirs of Victoriana Ramos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Raymunda Maglapuz is purportedly one of the heirs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The complaint alleged that spouses Alfred and Maxima Reyes (Spouses Reyes) paid rent to the  Spouses Jose and Raymunda Maglapuz (Spouses Maglapuz) for the use of the property from 1994 to August 1997 at the rate of P3,500.00 per month; that beginning September 1997, however, Spouses Reyes stopped paying rent;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that spouses Maglapuz served a letter dated August 9, 1999 on Spouses Reyes  demanding that the latter pay their rentals and vacate the property;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> that this was received by Spouses Reyes on August 12, 1999;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  that when no payment was made, Spouses Maglapuz filed said Civil Case No. 5663 against Spouses Reyes impleading Jimmy Banting (Banting) with whom Spouses Reyes entered into a partnership for the operation of a grocery store on the subject property.   <br><br>Defendants Spouses Reyes and Banting filed an Answer with Counterclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> They argued that Spouses Maglapuz have no cause of action against them for their possession of the subject property is lawful as it is based on a contract of lease executed in their favor by one named Carmencita dela Cruz, allegedly the rightful owner of the property. They demanded compensation by way of moral damages in the amount of P1,000,000.00 for the allegedly vexatious suit filed against them. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After preliminary conference and submission of position papers, the MeTC  rendered judgment in favor of  Spouses Maglapuz. The decretal portion of the August 13, 2002 Decision of the MeTC reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants for the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) Ordering the defendants to vacate the plaintiff's property and to return possession thereof to the plaintiffs;<br><br>2) Ordering the defendant to pay rental of P3,500.00 per month from September 1997 up to the time they have finally vacated the premises;<br><br>3) Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff the amount of P20,000.00 attorney's  fees and P1,000.00 per court appearance;<br><br>4) To pay cost of suit.<br></div><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>From the foregoing decision, Spouses Reyes and Banting  appealed to the RTC  (Branch 199, Las Pinas City)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which issued an Order dated September 27, 2002 directing the parties to file their respective memoranda on appeal within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The records reveal that defendants-appellants Spouses Reyes and Banting received copy of the Order on October 7, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Plaintiffs-appellees Spouses Maglapuz filed a Memorandum on Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Spouses Reyes and Banting did not file any memorandum.<br><br>In an Order dated November 21, 2002, the RTC dismissed the appeal, thus:<br><blockquote>It appearing that Defendants-Appellants failed to comply with the Order of this Court dated September 27, 2002 and pursuant to Section 3 Rule 7 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, the Appeal is hereby DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Spouses Reyes and Banting received copy of the Order on December 4, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Earlier, however, on December 2, 2002, Atty. Dionisio Landero,  collaborating counsel of the counsel of record, Atty. Jose Espinas,   filed an Entry of Appearance with Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Late Memorandum for Defendants-Appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> He attached thereto a "Memorandum for Defendants Spouses Alfred Reyes and Maxima Arceno Reyes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Counsel explained that the delay in filing the  memorandum on appeal was due to excusable negligence attributable to his clients who called his attention to the need to file a memorandum on appeal only on November 27, 2002. Prior to that date, counsel was not aware of any order for submission of memorandum as he did not receive copy of the September 27, 2002 Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He asked that the memorandum on appeal be admitted for it is meritorious in substance.  Specifically, it impugns the jurisdiction of the MeTC to issue the August 13, 2002 Decision on the following grounds: first, the complaint for ejectment was premature as Spouses Maglapuz failed to comply, much less allege compliance, with the  requirement of prior referral of a case to the barangay council for conciliation under Section 12, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court in relation to  paragraph c, Section 409, Chapter 7, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160 (Local Government Code);  second, the case is actually one of <span style="font-style: italic;">accion publiciana</span> cognizable by the RTC  for it was filed only in 1999, more than one year from the time possession of the subject property by Spouses Reyes and Banting allegedly became unlawful in 1997; and third, Spouses Maglapuz utterly failed to establish their title to the property as would justify their claim to a better right of possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The RTC rebuffed the motion for reconsideration.  It held  in its Order of January 7, 2003 that the delay in filing the memorandum on appeal was due to the inexcusable negligence of both counsel and clients who were given sufficient notice to file memorandum but, for lack of coordination, failed to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Spouses Reyes and Banting received copy of this Order on January 20, 2003.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">On that same day, they filed with the RTC a Notice of Appeal.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The RTC, in an Order dated January 23, 2003, disapproved the Notice of Appeal for failure of Spouses Reyes and Banting to pay appellate court docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The latter received copy of this Order on January 27, 2003. On the next day, it filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that appellate court docket fees were actually paid on January 21, 2003 as shown by copies of receipts attached to the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The RTC granted said Motion for Reconsideration in an Order dated January 30, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in effect giving due course to the Notice of Appeal to the CA. <br><br>On February 4, 2003, however, the RTC issued the following Order:<br><blockquote>This court notes that the Notice of Appeal availed of by the defendants is misplaced under the circumstances. The proper remedy provided for by law is the filing of a Verified Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals paying at the same time to the said court the corresponding docket fees and furnishing this court and adverse party with a copy of the Petition.<br><br>In view thereof, the Order dated January 23, 2003 is hereby RECALLED and the Order of the Court dated January 30, 2003 is hereby amended accordingly.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Through counsel, Spouses Reyes and Banting received copy of the foregoing Order on February 19, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Straightaway, they filed on February 24, 2003 a Petition for Review with the CA and paid on the same day the corresponding appellate docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They also served copies of the petition on the RTC and the adverse parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The CA dismissed the petition in the herein assailed Resolution dated May 16, 2003, portions of which read:<br><blockquote>The petition deserves but a short shrift.<br></blockquote><ol><li>We cannot review, much less declare null and void, the Decision of the MeTC xxx dated August 13, 2002 (not August 6, 1992 as stated in the prayer of the petitioners;

time for filing.</span> — A party desiring to appeal from a decision of the Regional Trial Court rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may file a verified petition for review with the Court of Appeals x x x.  The petition shall be filed and served <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision sought to be reviewed or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after judgment.</span>  x x x.<br></blockquote>An order of the RTC  dismissing an appeal from a decision of the MeTC for failure of appellant to file a memorandum on appeal is one such final order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It is appealable by petition for review under Rule 42.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the November 21, 2002 and January 7, 2003 RTC Orders dismissed petitioners' Appeal from the August 13, 2002 MeTC Decision for their failure to file a memorandum on appeal. These orders were therefore appealable by petition for review with the CA.  The Notice of Appeal petitioners initially filed was clearly erroneous. Petitioners sought to rectify their error by filing the Petition for Review with the CA on February 24, 2003. The question then is whether such recourse would prosper.<br><br>In  <span style="font-style: italic;">Neypes v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we fixed a uniform period for appeals filed under Rules 40, 42, 43 and 45.  Specifically,  we set the period to appeal at 15 days from notice of the decision or final order appealed from or,  where a motion for new trial or reconsideration is seasonably filed from the said decision or final order, within a fresh period of 15 days from receipt of the order denying the motion for new trial or reconsideration.<br><br>Applying the foregoing rule to the present case, petitioners should have filed the Petition for Review on February 5, 2003. To recall, petitioners received notice of the November 21, 2002 RTC Order on December 4, 2002.  Even before that, however, they were able to file an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration on December 2, 2002. This was denied by the RTC in its January 7, 2003 Order. Notice of said Order was received by petitioners on January 20, 2003.  Hence, they had a fresh period of 15 days or until February 5, 2003  to file a petition for review.<br><br>As it were, however, petitioners filed instead a Notice of Appeal on January 20, 2003.   Such mode of  appeal under Section 2 (a) of Rule 41 was faulty. Recourse to it did not toll the running of the period within which to file a petition for review. It is axiomatic that a fatally defective or erroneous appeal or motion will  not toll the running of a period to appeal.  A detour from the proper course of an appeal will not earn for the errant party a fresh start.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioners therefore got entangled in an erroneous mode of appeal and squandered away the remaining time it had to file a petition for review.  The Petition for Review they filed with the CA on February 24, 2003 was out of time.<br><br>Moreover, the said Petition for Review was fatally defective.  The petitioners prayed for the following reliefs:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, Defendants-Appellants, now the herein Petitioners respectfully pray this Honorable Court, the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) To issue a writ of Preliminary Injunction or Restraining Order ex-parte upon the filing of this Petition;<br><br>b) That upon due consideration of the Petition, an order be issued making the Preliminary Injunction and/or Restraining Order permanent until after the final resolution of the instant Petition;<br></div><br>That after due notice and consideration of the herein Petition, Petitioner further pray the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">c) To issue an Order declaring the subject Decision Annex "C" of the Lower Court dated August 6, 1992 [sic]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> null and void;<br><br>d) Ordering the Complaint dated September 21, 1999 (Annex "D") dismissed with prejudice.<br><br>e) Ordering the Order [sic] of the Public Respondent Court RTC 199 dated January 23, 2003 null and void; and<br><br>f) Furthermore, ordering the Private Respondent to pay the herein Petitioner damages and attorneys fees to be determined by the Honorable Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></div> </blockquote>The Petition for Review was directed at both the August 13, 2002 Decision of the MeTC and the January 23, 2003 Order of the RTC.  This is odd.  The August 13, 2002 MeTC Decision and the January 23, 2003 RTC Order are matters not proper for a petition for review under Rule 42. As correctly declared by the CA, it has no appellate jurisdiction over the MeTC and it cannot entertain a direct appeal from said decision. As to the RTC January 23, 2003 Order disapproving the Notice of Appeal, this was expressly reconsidered by the RTC in its January 30, 2003 Order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> in effect allowing the Notice of Appeal.  This however was further amended by the RTC in its Order dated February 4, 2003 declaring that the Notice of Appeal to the CA was misplaced and that the proper remedy is the filing of a petition for review.  When petitioners filed their Petition for Review, they did not question the February 4, 2003 Order of the RTC. <br><br>All told, the CA did not err in dismissing their Petition for Review for it was not only tardy but also fatally defective.<br><br>We will, nonetheless, briefly treat the substance of the petition for review with the CA, if only to settle the issue whether or not the RTC committed an error in dismissing petitioners' appeal on the ground that no memorandum on appeal has been filed by them.<br><br>The RTC validly dismissed the appeal of petitioners from the August 13, 2002 Decision of the MeTC.<br><br>The appeal was deemed abandoned when petitioners failed to file their memorandum on appeal despite sufficient time given to them by the court. A memorandum on appeal or an appeal brief is vital to an appeal for only errors specifically assigned and properly argued in the brief or memorandum will be considered in the decision on the merits, except those affecting jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as plain and clerical errors. Hence, the lack of a memorandum on appeal is ground for the dismissal of an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The excuse proffered by counsel for petitioners for their failure to file the memorandum of appeal did not help their cause any. Assuming that he did not receive copy of the September 27, 2002 Order, he could have nonetheless informed himself of this requirement by checking on the progress of the case from time to time. A counsel is required to inquire about the status of the cases assigned to him and the motions he has filed for a client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> He cannot pass this burden to his client and blame the latter for every mishap.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It was therefore due to the inexcusable negligence of counsel that the memorandum on appeal was not filed on time.<br><br>We stop short, however, from declaring the negligence of counsel as gross so as to liberate petitioners from the effects of their failure to file a memorandum on appeal. This is actually what petitioners would have us uphold. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> They claim that their counsel's negligence was so gross that they were virtually deprived of due process and representation in the proceedings below.<br><br>Such argument fails to impress.  We refer petitioners to their Entry of Appearance with Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Late Memorandum for Defendants-Appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> There they specifically argued that the failure of their counsel to file the memorandum on appeal was "x x x by reason of his <span style="font-weight: bold;">excusable negligence.</span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Petitioners cannot now turn around and claim that the negligence of their counsel is gross and that they may be said to have been deprived of due process.<br><br>In the interest of substantial justice, we deem it likewise necessary to resolve the other issues raised by petitioners.<br><br>They argue that the MeTC had no jurisdiction to issue the August 13, 2002 Decision for respondents failed to comply with the requirement of <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay </span>conciliation;  and that the case was actually one of <span style="font-style: italic;">accion publiciana</span> cognizable by the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Such arguments lack merit.<br><br>It is settled that the requirement under Section 412 of the Local Government Code that a case be referred for conciliation before the <span style="font-style: italic;">Lupon </span>as a precondition to its filing in court applies only to those cases where the real parties-in-interest actually reside in the same city or municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Here, the complaint filed with the MeTC specifically alleged that the parties reside in different barangays and cities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>As to the jurisdiction of the MeTC,  this can be determined from the complaint itself. It plainly states that the last demand was made by respondents upon petitioners on August 9, 1999. The complaint for ejectment was filed on September 21, 1999 or before the lapse of the one-year period. It was therefore properly filed  with the MeTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>All told, the appeal of petitioners fell short even on the merits.  It was properly dismissed by the RTC.
