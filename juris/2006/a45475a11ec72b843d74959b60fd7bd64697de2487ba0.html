That corollary to our complaint against Judge Plenio de la Peña, the League of Barangays in the Municipality of Caibiran, Biliran also made a petition, copy is hereto attached and marked as Annex "B." Judge Plenio dela Peña who personally intervened and helped candidates or has involved himself in partisan political activity used government equipment and supplies, copy of some materials are printed utilizing the computer and printer of the Office for his personal benefit, copy of the materials are hereto attached and marked as Annex "C."<br><br>With regard to his complaint against me for Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct, I vehemently deny his accusations. I did not use government money nor property for my personal benefit. I did [not] abuse my office. Last January 3, 2005, I sent a letter of explanation to the Chief Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office, Office of the Court Administrator, Supreme Court, Manila, copy is hereto attached and marked as Annex "D," together with the copy of the two (2) Interbranch Deposit Accommodation with Land Bank, Naval Branch dated December 29, 2004, and the third amount could not be deposited against the Fiduciary Funds because Judge Plenio de la Peña withdraw (sic) the bankbook from the possession of Mr. Orlando Salentes, designated Officer-in-Charge in lieu of me. So, on December 29, 2004, I gave the money to the new OIC in our Office, Mr. Orlando Salentes, and he acknowledged the receipt of the amount of P61,400.00, copy of the acknowledgement receipt is hereto attached and marked as Annex "E." That Mr. Orlando Salentes executed an Affidavit on December 29, 2004, explaining why he was not able to deposit the money that I turned over to him, to whom the passbook for the fiduciary funds should have been in custody, however, said bankbook was taken from him by Judge Plenio dela Peña. On my end, I had no more money accountability as of December 31, 2004, because I deposited with the Land Bank Naval Branch the JDF Savings Account and Special Allowance for Judiciary Funds. The Fiduciary Funds was already turned over to Mr. Orlando Salentes, my successor in the Office of the Clerk of Court, for all monies, properties and records as required through the order relieving me from my responsibilities as Clerk of Court. All properties, records and money accountabilities were turned over to Mr. Orlando Salentes, OIC Clerk of Court, to clear myself from accountabilities and responsibility before I assumed to RTC Branch 37.<br><br>Relative to the memorandum issued to Judge Plenio de la Peña from the Court Administrator dated October 27, 2004, the same was already complied with and I forwarded my compliance to the Chief Fiscal Monitoring Office, OCA, Supreme Court.<br><br>I did not use any amount for my personal benefit, and all the amounts as stated in the complaint of Judge Plenio de la Peña were remitted to the Land Bank of the Philippines for the account of the Supreme Court and to Mr. Orlando Salentes on the Fiduciary Funds as should be in possession of the bankbook to record his deposit of the money that came to his possession by way of his Office.<br></blockquote>For his part, Judge Dela Peña submitted his Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> stating that contrary to the allegation of respondent, the filing of the request for his transfer was done in retaliation for his issuance of the Memorandum dated November 23, 2004 relieving respondent of his duties and responsibilities. Respondent then sent to the OCA a request for a 38-day extension to restore the cash shortage. Judge Dela Peña stated that respondent's request for extension of time is in itself an admission that the funds "were not in his possession and could not be produced and deposited immediately in the Supreme Court accounts because [respondent] used it for his personal benefit." The complainant judge further pointed out that there is clear evidence of malversation on the part of respondent, which would in turn constitute grave misconduct and dishonesty punishable by dismissal from the service.&nbsp; Respondent's Letter dated November 24, 2004 addressed to the OCA reads:<br><blockquote>Relative to your memorandum to the undersigned dated 27 October 2004, which I received on November 23, 2004, directing me to "restitute/deposit unremitted collections listed therein within ten (10) days from notice," may I respectfully request that I be given until December 31, 2004 within which to comply [with] your memorandum.<br><br><i>This request is prompted by the fact that the yuletide season is approaching and, by tradition, everybody would want to celebrate the occasion which will necessarily entail expenses.<br></i><br>Rest assured that I will comply with your memorandum.<br><br>May I also take this occasion to inform you that on November 23, 2004, I received from Judge Dela Peña a memorandum of even date relieving me of my duties and functions as Clerk of Court, effective upon receipt of said memorandum, per your instruction. Copy of said memorandum is hereto attached.<br><br>May I be clarified Mr. Justice if the order for my relief has the imprimatur of your office considering that your memorandum does not say so. Pending receipt of the answer to my query, I am inclined not to consider the memorandum of Judge Dela Peña, since he has no authority to relieve me of my duties and functions as Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>In its Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated March 8, 2006, the OCA recommended that respondent be dismissed from the service with forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any, with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, for dishonesty and grave misconduct, and that he be directed "to pay the amount of interest which the Court failed to earn had the collections been deposited on time, upon the determination of the exact amount of the interest by the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office, OCA."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We agree with the foregoing findings and recommendation.<br><br>No less than the Constitution itself provides that <i>a public office is a public trust. Public officers and employees are duty bound to serve the people with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency and shall, at all times, remain accountable to the people</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Persons involved in the administration of justice ought to live up to the strictest standard of honesty and integrity in the public service.&nbsp; The conduct of every personnel connected with the courts should, at all times, be circumspect to preserve the integrity and dignity of our courts of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> As forerunners in the administration of justice, they ought to live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity, considering that their positions primarily involve service to the public. &nbsp;Clerks of Court, in particular, are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts who must show competence, honesty and probity, having been charged with safeguarding the integrity of the court and its proceedings.&nbsp; Furthermore, they are judicial officers entrusted to perform delicate functions with regard to the collection of legal fees, and are expected to correctly and effectively implement regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> &nbsp;Hence, as custodians of court funds and revenues, they have always been reminded of their duty to immediately deposit the various funds received by them to the authorized government depositories for <i>they are not supposed to keep funds in their custody</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In this case, respondent's act of requesting for additional time to produce the funds leads to no other conclusion than that the questioned funds were not in his possession.&nbsp; As pointed out by the OCA, respondent did not question the findings of the financial audit team from the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office that examined the books of account from May 1989 to September 2004 which found that he had a cash shortage of P65,684.00 representing collections for the JDF, Fiduciary Fund, and Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund; instead, he requested that he be given until the yuletide season to restitute the amount. &nbsp;We agree with the following findings of the OCA:<br><blockquote>SC Circular No. 5-93 mandates that "collections for the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) shall be deposited every day with the local or nearest Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) branch." Furthermore, Circular No. 50-95 provides that "all collections from bailbonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collections shall be deposited with the [LBP] by the Clerk of Court concerned within twenty-four (24) hours from receipt hereof. In localities where there are no branches of LBP, fiduciary collections shall be deposited by the Clerk of Court with the provincial, city or municipal treasurer."<br><br>Respondent clearly violated the aforementioned circulars. As Clerk of Court, respondent is an accountable officer entrusted with the great responsibility of collecting money belonging to the funds of the court. He has the duty to immediately deposit with the authorized government depositories the various funds he had collected because he is not authorized to keep those funds in his custody. Regrettably, he abused the trust and confidence reposed upon him and did not perform his duty with utmost loyalty and honesty. His unwarranted failure to fulfill his responsibilities deserves administrative sanction and not even the restitution of the full amount will exempt him from liability.<br><br>On 29 December 2004, respondent deposited with the Landbank of the Philippines the amount of Two Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-Four Pesos (P2,924.00) and One Thousand Three Hundred Sixty Pesos (P1,360.00) for the Judiciary Development Fund and Special Allowance for Judiciary Fund, respectively, and on 12 January 2005, sixty One Thousand Four Hundred Pesos (P61,400.00) for the Fiduciary Fund. Respondent also deposited on 4 January 2006 Seven Hundred Fifty-Four Pesos (P754.00) for the JDF and Special Allowance for Judiciary Fund for the period 1 October 2004 to 23 November 2004.<br><br>The restitution of the shortages though made was belatedly done by respondent; the non-remittance thereof on time deprived the Court of the interest that may have accrued if it were deposited on time. The fact that she did ultimately restore the full amount misappropriated certainly cannot in full exonerate her from liability. Respondent was dismissed from the service (<i>JPDIO v. Calaguas, 256 SCRA 690 [1996]</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The failure of a clerk of court to turn over funds in his possession and adequately explain and present evidence thereon constitutes gross dishonesty, grave misconduct, and even malversation of public funds which this Court will never countenance, as these offenses indubitably diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; We are thus left with no choice but to declare the respondent guilty of dishonesty and gross misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Dishonesty alone, being in the nature of a grave offense, carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service.
