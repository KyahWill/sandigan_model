In 1990, the lease contract was renewed by Pilipinas Shell and respondent.<br><br>Petitioners, being dealers of Pilipinas Shell's petroleum products, were allowed to occupy the property.  Petitioners are thus considered agents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of Pilipinas Shell. The factual milieu of the instant case calls then for the application of the provisions on lease under the New Civil Code.<br><br>The right of the lessor upon the termination of a lease contract with respect to useful improvements introduced on the leased property by a lessee is covered by Article 1678 which reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 1678. If the lessee makes, in good faith, useful improvements which are suitable to the use for which the lease is intended, without altering the form or substance of the property leased, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the lessor upon the termination of the lease shall pay the lessee one-half of the value of the improvements at that time</span>. Should the lessor refuse to reimburse said amount, the lessee may remove the improvements, even though the principal thing may suffer damage thereby. He shall not, however, cause any more impairment upon the property leased than is necessary.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x (Emphasis supplied)<br></div></blockquote>The foregoing provision is a modification of the old Code under which the lessee had no right at all to be reimbursed for the improvements introduced on the leased property, he being entitled   merely to the rights of a usufructuary – right of removal and set-off, but not of reimbursement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The modification introduced in the above-quoted paragraph of Article 1678 on partial reimbursement was intended to prevent unjust enrichment of the lessor which now has to pay one-half of the value of the improvements at the time the lease terminates because the lessee has already enjoyed the same, whereas the lessor could enjoy them indefinitely thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As the law on lease under the New Civil Code has specific rules concerning useful improvements introduced by a lessee on the property leased, it is erroneous on the part of petitioners to urge this Court to apply Article 448, in relation to Article 546, regarding their claim for reimbursement and to invoke the right of retention before reimbursement is made. Article 448 and Article 546 read:<br><blockquote>ART. 448. The owner of the land on which anything has been built, sown or planted in good faith, shall have the right to appropriate as his own the works, sowing or planting, after payment of the indemnity provided for in articles 546 and 548, or to oblige the one who built or planted to pay the price of the land, and the one who sowed, the proper rent. However, the builder or planter cannot be obliged to buy the land if its value is considerably more than that of the building or trees. In such case, he shall pay reasonable rent, if the owner of the land does not choose to appropriate the building or trees after proper indemnity. The parties shall agree upon the terms of the lease and in case of disagreement, the court shall fix the terms thereof.<br><br>ART. 546. Necessary expenses shall be refunded to every possessor; but only the possessor in good faith may retain the thing until he has been reimbursed therefor.<br><br>Useful expenses shall be refunded only to the possessor in good faith with the same right of retention, the person who has defeated him in the possession having the  option of refunding the amount of the expenses or of paying the increase in value which the thing may have acquired by reason thereof.<br></blockquote>Jurisprudence is replete with cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which categorically declare that Article 448 covers only cases in which the builders, sowers or planters <span style="text-decoration: underline;">believe</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">themselves</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be owners</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">land</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">least,</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">claim</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">title</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thereto</span>, but not when the interest is merely that of a holder, such as a mere tenant, agent or usufructuary. A tenant cannot be said to be a builder in good faith as he has no pretension to be owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote>In a plethora of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court has held that Articles 448 of the Civil Code, in relation to Article 546 of the same Code, which allows full reimbursement of useful improvements and retention of the premises until reimbursement is made, applies only to a possessor in good faith, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">builds</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">land</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">belief</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">owner</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thereof</span>.

Petitioner stubbornly insists that he may not be ejected from private respondent's land because he has the right, under Articles 448 and 546 of the New Civil Code, to retain possession of the leased premises until he is paid the full fair market value of the building constructed thereon by his parents. Petitioner is wrong, of course. The Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals correctly held that it is Article 1678 of the New Civil Code that governs petitioner's right vis-a-vis the improvements built by his parents on private respondent's land.<br><br>In the 1991 case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cabangis v. Court of Appeals</span> where the subject of the lease contract was also a parcel of land and the lessee's father constructed a family residential house thereon, and the lessee subsequently demanded indemnity for the improvements built on the lessor's land based on Articles 448 and 546 of the New Civil Code, we pointed out that reliance on said legal provisions was misplaced.<br><br>"The reliance by the respondent Court of Appeals on Articles 448 and 546 of the Civil Code of the Philippines is misplaced.

On this score, the commentary of Justice Paras is enlightening.<br><blockquote>'Note that under the 1st paragraph of Art. 1678, the law on the right of REMOVAL says that 'should the lessor refuse to reimburse said amount, the lessee may remove the improvements, even though the principal thing may suffer thereby.' While the phrase 'even though' implies that Art. 1678 always applies regardless of whether or not the improvements can be removed without injury to the leased premises, it is believed that application of the Article cannot always be done. The rule is evidently intended for cases where a true accession takes place as when part of the land leased is, say, converted into a fishpond; and certainly not where as easily removable thing (such as a wooden fence) has been introduced. There is no doubt that in a case involving such a detachable fence, the lessee can take the same away with him when the lease expires (5 E. Paras, Civil Code of the Philippines Annotated 345 [11th ed., 1986]).'<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div></blockquote></blockquote>Clearly, it is Article 1678 of the New Civil Code which applies to the present case.<br><br>Petitioners' claim for reimbursement of the alleged entire value of the improvements does not thus lie under Article 1678.  Not even for one-half of such alleged value, there being no substantial evidence, <span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.,</span> receipts or other documentary evidence detailing costs of construction.  Besides, by petitioners' admission, of the structures they originally built — the billiard hall, restaurant, <span style="font-style: italic;">sari-sari</span> store and a parking lot, only the "<span style="font-style: italic;">bodega-like</span>" <span style="font-style: italic;">sari-sari </span>store and the parking lot now exist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>At all events, under Article 1678, it is the lessor who is given the option, upon termination of the lease contract, either to appropriate the useful improvements by paying one-half of their value at that time, or to allow the lessee to remove the improvements. This option solely belongs to the lessor as the law is explicit that "[s]hould the lessor refuse to reimburse said amount, the lessee may remove the improvements, even though the principal thing may suffer damage thereby."  It appears that the lessor has opted not to reimburse.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
