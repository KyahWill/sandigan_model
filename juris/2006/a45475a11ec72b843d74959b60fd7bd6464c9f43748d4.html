				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Case</span><br></div><br>This is an administrative complaint filed by Arcely Y. Santos ("complainant") against Judge Ubaldino A. Lacurom ("respondent judge"), Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cabanatuan City, Branch 29 and Pairing Judge, Branch 30.  Complainant charged respondent judge with gross misconduct, grave abuse of judicial authority, gross bias and partiality, and gross violation of the Code of Judicial Ethics. <br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>The complaint stemmed from respondent judge's alleged bias and partiality in favor of one Rogelio R. Santos, Sr. ("Santos"), who had three pending cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> before respondent judge's sala, as shown by the following:<br><ol><li>Respondent judge allowed Santos, a non-lawyer, to appear in court and litigate  personally the three cases.  Complainant pointed out that Santos was already represented by counsels<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> who have not withdrawn their appearances.  Complainant alleged that respondent judge is guilty of gross misconduct and grave abuse of judicial discretion for having allowed a non-lawyer to engage in the practice law.<br><br>In Special Proceedings Case No. 516-AF, respondent judge, in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 28 February 2003,  even "appointed" Santos as lead counsel for the petitioners.  As early as 26 September 2002, complainant had been questioning the appearance of Santos as "counsel" during the proceedings in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 11 November 2002, complainant filed a motion to expunge a pleading signed by Santos, claiming that Santos, a non-lawyer, is not allowed to sign pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In a Joint Resolution dated 7 February 2003, respondent judge denied complainant's motion and stated that Santos is qualified to conduct his litigation personally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Then on 20 February 2003, complainant filed a motion to reconsider the Joint Resolution and suggested that, since Santos is now representing himself and, at the same time, is being represented by counsel, respondent judge should appoint a member of the Bar as lead counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>On the other hand, complainant alleged that she and the other oppositors were not allowed to address the court directly and respondent judge even compelled them, under the pain of contempt, to secure the services of a lawyer to represent them.<br><br></li><li>Respondent judge always granted, with dispatch, all the pleadings of Santos.<br><br></li><li>Respondent judge had unduly delayed the execution of the 28 April 2000 Court of Appeals' decision against Santos in Cadastral Case No. 384-AF.<br><br></li><li>Respondent judge denied complainant's letter-request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated 16 March 2001 for respondent judge to inhibit himself from the cases to avoid suspicion of bias, prejudice, conflict of interest and partiality. Complainant alleged that respondent judge used his office to advance and protect the interests of Santos, respondent judge's "close friend," to the prejudice of complainant and in violation of Canon 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the Code of Judicial Conduct (Code).<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Complainant pointed out that in an earlier case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> respondent judge inhibited himself because Santos is respondent judge's "close friend."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <br><br>Complainant also added that respondent judge refused to inhibit himself because he was protecting his interest in Villa Benita Subdivision ("subdivision").  Complainant explained that all three cases involved properties in the subdivision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and that respondent judge is an incorporator,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> a director, an officer and a legal adviser<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of Villa Benita Homeowners Association ("VBHA").  VBHA allegedly filed several cases before the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) against Fabern's Inc. and complainant.  Complainant asserted that respondent judge had personal knowledge of the facts of the HLURB cases.  Complainant added that in refusing to inhibit himself, respondent judge violated Rule 3.12 (a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and Canon 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Code.<br></div><br>In its 1st Indorsement dated 15 May 2003, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) required respondent judge to comment on complainant's allegations and to show cause why he should not be sanctioned as a member of the Bar for violation of Canon 9, Rule 9.01<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>In an Answer dated 27 June 2003, respondent judge offered the following explanations:<br><ol><li>Respondent  judge, citing Section 34, Rule 138<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the Rules of Court (Rules), admitted that he allowed Santos to litigate personally his cases before the court.<br><br>On Special Proceedings Case No. 516-AF, respondent judge explained that he merely "recognized" Santos as lead counsel because his counsel was often absent from the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Respondent judge added that complainant's counsel did not object to the appointment of Santos as lead counsel, but merely suggested that lead counsel should be a member of the Bar.  Respondent judge also added that, if complainant did not agree with respondent judge's decision on the matter, complainant should have filed a petition for certiorari.<br><br>Respondent judge also explained that  complainant was allowed to address the court directly, though not at length because complainant was represented by counsel.<br><br></li><li>Respondent judge denied that he always granted the pleadings of Santos.<br><br></li><li>Respondent judge denied that the Court of Appeals' decision in Cadastral Case  No. 384-AF has remained unenforced because of his bias in favor of Santos.  Respondent judge stated that he had ordered the implementation of the decision as early as 25 September 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and issued a writ of execution on 25 October 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br></li><li>Respondent judged stated that he denied complainant's request to inhibit himself because he can fairly hear and decide the cases.<br><br>On respondent judge's inhibition in Civil Case No. 3074-AF, respondent judge explained that he inhibited himself from the case because Santos was his "close friend," while respondents were not respondent judge's friends.  In these cases, respondent judge pointed out that he was friends with both Santos and the other parties<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> to the cases, in effect, "neutralizing" respondent judge's close friendship with Santos.  <br><br>Respondent judge explained that Santos became a "close friend" when Santos lent his portable bunker to Dr. Ferdinand Lacurom ("Dr. Lacurom"), respondent judge's son, during the construction of Dr. Lacurom's house in the subdivision.  Respondent judge also admitted that the officers of Fabern's Inc. extended a favor to  Dr. Lacurom when they facilitated the cementing of the road in front of  Dr. Lacurom's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> However, respondent judge denied that he received any favor from Santos. <br><br>On the matter of VBHA, respondent judge denied that he had any interest to protect in the subdivision, as respondent judge is not a landowner, or homeowner, or lessee in the subdivision.  Respondent judge clarified that Dr. Lacurom is the one who owns property in the subdivision and that respondent judge stayed there only on some occasions.  Respondent judge admitted that he is a "nominal" incorporator and adviser of VBHA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  Atty. Napoleon Reyes, president of VBHA, requested respondent judge to agree to be an incorporator  of VBHA "to lend a bit of prestige to the association." However, respondent judge stated that his only participation in VBHA was to sign the registration documents of VBHA.  Respondent judge clarified that he never attended any of the meetings of VBHA, nor has he any knowledge of any case filed by VBHA before the HLURB. <br><br>Respondent judge also stated that if complainant filed the proper motion for inhibition, he would have granted the same.<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The OCA's Report and Recommendation</span><br></div><br>In its Report dated 21 November 2003, the OCA recommended that the complaint be re-docketed as an administrative matter and that respondent judge be fined P5,000.  The OCA found respondent judge administratively liable for recognizing Santos as lead counsel despite the fact that Santos had two counsels of record.  The OCA did not find respondent judge liable for the delay in the execution of the decision of the Court of Appeals in Cadastral Case No. 384-AF, as the delay was brought about by the parties themselves.  On respondent judge being an incorporator and adviser of VBHA and his refusal to inhibit himself from the cases, the OCA opined that the subject cases are not covered by the rule on mandatory disqualification of judges, hence, respondent judge's inhibition rested upon his own discretion.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 21 January 2004, the Court resolved to docket the case as a regular administrative matter and required the parties to manifest within ten days from notice if they were willing to submit the case for resolution based on the pleadings on record.  Respondent judge manifested affirmatively.  Complainant filed a memorandum dated 9 August 2004 reiterating her allegations.  In turn, respondent judge also submitted a memorandum on 21 August 2004.<br><br>Complainant filed the present administrative complaint on 5 May 2003 when respondent judge was still presiding judge of Branch 29 and pairing judge of Branch 30.  Respondent judge compulsorily retired on 16 May 2003.  However, his retirement does not render this administrative case moot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>In administrative proceedings, the complainant has the burden of proving by substantial evidence the allegations in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  In this case, complainant failed to prove that respondent judge granted with dispatch all the pleadings of Santos and that respondent judge was responsible for the delay in the execution of the Court of Appeals' decision in Cadastral Case  No. 384-AF. Hence, the Court dismisses this particular charge. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">On a Party's Right to Self Representation</span><br></div><br>The Rules recognize the right of an individual to represent himself in any case in which he is a party. The Rules state that a party may conduct his litigation personally or by aid of an attorney, and that his appearance must be either personal or by a duly authorized member of the Bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The individual litigant may personally do everything in the progress of the action from commencement to the termination of the litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> A party's representation on his own behalf is not considered to be a practice of law as "one does not practice law by acting for himself, any more than he practices medicine by rendering first aid to himself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Therefore, Santos can conduct the litigation of the cases personally.  Santos is not engaged in the practice of law if he represents himself in cases in which he is a party.  By conducting the litigation of his own cases, Santos acts not as a counsel or lawyer but as a party exercising his right to represent himself.  Certainly, Santos does not become a counsel or lawyer by exercising such right.<br><br>The Court, however, notes the use of the disjunctive word "or" under the Rules, signifying disassociation and independence of one thing from each of the other things enumerated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> to mean that a party must choose between self-representation or being represented by a member of the bar.  During the course of the proceedings, a party should not be allowed to shift from one form of representation to another. Otherwise, this would lead to confusion, not only for the other party, but for the court as well.  If a party, originally represented by counsel, would later decide to represent himself, the prudent course of action is to dispense with the services of counsel and prosecute or defend the case personally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>For the orderly administration of justice, respondent judge should not have allowed Santos to litigate personally because Santos was already represented by counsel.  Respondent judge should have required Santos to choose between self-representation or being represented by counsel.<br><br>Moreover, respondent judge should not have recognized Santos as lead counsel.  The "lead counsel" is the lawyer on either side of a litigated action who is charged with the principal management and direction of the party's case, as distinguished from his collaborating counsels or  subordinates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In recognizing Santos as "lead counsel", respondent judge made it appear that Santos was a counsel or lawyer when he is not. To repeat, when a party represents himself in his own case, he does so not as a counsel or lawyer but as a party exercising his right of self-representation.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">On Respondent Judge's Inhibition</span><br></div><br>The Court agrees with the OCA's finding that respondent judge's inhibition from the cases was discretionary.  The three cases do not fall under the instances covered by the rule on the mandatory disqualification of judges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and the issue of voluntary inhibition is primarily a matter of conscience and sound discretion on the part of the judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Besides, complainant did not follow the proper procedure for the disqualification of judges.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Constante v. Pimentel,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court ruled that the procedure for disqualification of judges in Section 2, Rule 137<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> must be substantially followed. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">On Respondent Judge's Violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct</span><br></div><br>On respondent judge's admission that Dr. Lacurom received a favor from the officers of Fabern's Inc., respondent judge violated Rule 5.04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Code.  Fabern's Inc. is the petitioner in Cadastral Case No. 384-AF, which was then pending before respondent judge's sala.  Respondent judge should have advised Dr. Lacurom not to accept any favor from  Fabern's Inc. or from any of its officers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> or principal stockholders. Judges, as occupants of exalted positions in the administration of justice, must pay a high price for the honor bestowed on them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Their private, as well as their official conduct, must always be free from the appearance of impropriety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On respondent judge's close friendship with Santos,  such fact did not render respondent judge guilty of violating any canon of judicial ethics as long as his friendly relations with Santos did not influence his official conduct as a judge in the cases where Santos was a party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Complainant failed to present any convincing proof that respondent judge gave any undue privileges in his court to Santos, or that Santos benefited from his personal relations with respondent judge, or that respondent judge used his influence, if any, to favor Santos. <br><br>However, it would have been more prudent if respondent judge avoided hearing the cases where Santos was a party because their close friendship could reasonably tend to raise suspicion that respondent judge's social relationship with Santos would be an element in his determination of the cases of Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This may erode the trust of the litigants in  respondent judge's impartiality and eventually, undermine the people's faith in the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Judges must not only render a just, correct and impartial decision but should do so in such a manner as to be free from any suspicion as to his fairness, impartiality and integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">On the Appropriate Penalty Against Respondent Judge</span><br></div><br>Respondent judge's actuations constitute simple misconduct, a less serious charge punishable with (a) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for a period of not less than one month but not more than three months; or (b) fine of more than P10,000 but not exceeding P20,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> However, considering that respondent judge had retired compulsorily on 16 May 2003 after twenty-eight years of service in the government and that this is respondent judge's first offense, the P10,000 withheld from his retirement benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> should be forfeited as sufficient penalty for his administrative offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the Court finds respondent Judge Ubaldino A. Lacurom <span style="font-weight: bold;">GUILTY </span>of simple misconduct and <span style="font-weight: bold;">ORDERS </span>the <span style="font-weight: bold;">FORFEITURE </span>of  the P10,000 withheld from his retirement benefits. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio Morales </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tinga, JJ., </span>concur<span style="font-style: italic;">.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., J., </span>no part due to prior action in OCA.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The three cases are:<br><ol><li>Special  Proceedings  Case  No. 516-AF entitled "In re:  Settlement  of  the  Intestate  Estate  of Spouses Filomeno Santos, Sr. and  Benita Rodriguez Santos, Rogelio R.
