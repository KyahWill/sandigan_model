				<BR><STRONG>CORONA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> seeking to reverse the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 24614 entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">People of the Philippines v. Crisanta B. Bonifacio.</span><br><br>Private complainant Ofelia Santos was a businesswoman and a buy-and-sell agent of jewelry. Sometime in March 1996, petitioner Crisanta Bonifacio was introduced to her. She expressed interest to see the pieces of jewelry Santos was selling.<br><br>On March 21, 1996, petitioner received several pieces of jewelry from Santos. She signed a document acknowledging receipt of the jewelry and agreeing to sell these items on commission basis. She also promised to remit the proceeds of the sale or return the unsold items to Santos within 15 days.<br><br>Petitioner failed to turn over the proceeds of the sale within the given period. She, however, returned some of the unsold items at a later date. The value of the pieces unaccounted for amounted to P154,000.<br><br>On March 28, 1996, petitioner asked Santos for new sets of jewelry to sell under the same terms and conditions. Again, on due date, petitioner failed to account. This time, the value of the unpaid and unreturned items amounted to P91,500.<br><br>On April 3, 1996, petitioner once more accepted several pieces of jewelry and signed an acknowledgment receipt under the same terms and conditions. On due date, petitioner again failed to pay. The pieces of jewelry left unpaid and unreturned amounted to P38,500.<br><br>In a letter dated July 25, 1996, Santos demanded from petitioner the payment of the total amount of P244,500. Petitioner gave her two checks amounting to P30,000 as partial payment. The checks, however, bounced for being drawn against insufficient funds and being drawn against a closed account, respectively.<br><br>Petitioner was thereafter charged with the crime of estafa under Article 315 (1)(b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in an Information filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 258, National Capital Judicial Region, Parañaque City:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 21st and 28th of March 1996, in the Municipality of Parañaque, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, received in trust from the complainant Ofelia Santos, sets of jewelries worth P244,000.00 for the purpose of selling the same with the express obligation to remit the proceeds thereof, if sold, and return if not sold, but the accused once in possession of said sets of jewelries, with unfaithfulness and abuse of confidence, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate and convert the same for her own personal use and benefit and despite several demands to return and/or account for the same, she fails and refuses to the damage and prejudice of the complainant therein, in the aforesaid amount of P244,000.00.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>On arraignment, petitioner entered a plea of not guilty. Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>After trial, the court a quo rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding accused CRISANTA B. BONIFACIO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of ESTAFA under Par. 1 (b), Art. 315 of the Revised Penal Code, accused CRISANTA B. BONIFACIO is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of twenty (20) years of <span style="font-style: italic;">RECLUSION TEMPORAL</span>, with all the accessory penalties provided by law; to indemnify private complainant, Ofelia Santos, the amount of P284,000.00, as actual damages with interest at the legal rate from the filing of the Information until fully paid, and to pay the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Dissatisfied, petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals. The appellate court affirmed the RTC decision but modified the penalty:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the appealed Decision finding the accused-appellant Crisanta B. Bonifacio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Estafa under Article 315(1) par. b of the Revised Penal Code is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">modification</span> that the accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of four (4) years and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> as minimum to twenty (20) years of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> as maximum and to indemnify the private complainant, Ofelia Santos, the amount of P244,000.00 as actual damages with interest at the legal rate from the filing of the Information until fully paid, and to pay the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the decision of the trial court finding her guilty of estafa under article 315 (1)(b), RPC. She maintains that the element<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of misappropriation or conversion was not proved, thus her liability should only be civil in nature. Petitioner likewise contends that the indeterminate sentence (four years and one day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> as minimum to 20 years of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal</span> as maximum) imposed on her by the appellate court was excessive.<br><br>There is no merit in the petition.<br><br>The essence of estafa under Article 315 (1)(b), RPC is the appropriation or conversion of money or property received, to the prejudice of the owner. The words "convert" and "misappropriate" connote an act of using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or of devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In an agency for the sale of jewelry, it is the agent's duty to return the jewelry on demand of the owner. The demand for the return of the thing delivered in trust and the failure of the accused-agent to account for it are circumstantial evidence of misappropriation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioner admitted that she received the pieces of jewelry on commission. She likewise admitted that she failed to return the items or their value on Santos' demand. On the other hand, the testimony of her lone witness, Lilia Pascual, failed to rebut the prosecution's evidence that she misappropriated the items or their corresponding value. She also never appeared in the trial court to refute the charge against her. Hence, the trial and appellate courts' conclusion of guilt by misappropriation was a logical consequence of the established facts.<br><br>Besides, evidentiary matters or matters of fact raised in the court below are not proper in petitions for certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The findings of fact of the Court of Appeals, affirming those of the trial court, are conclusive and binding on the parties and are not reviewable by the Supreme Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We now discuss the propriety of the indeterminate sentence imposed by the appellate court.<br><br>The penalty for estafa with abuse of confidence is provided in paragraph 1, Article 315, RPC:<br><blockquote>1st. The penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> in its maximum period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos, and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> or reclusion temporal, as the case may be.<br><br>x x x<br></blockquote>Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the maximum term of the penalty shall be "that which in view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed" under the RPC and the minimum shall be "within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed" for the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In this case, the penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> in its minimum period is the imposable penalty if the amount of the fraud is over P12,000 but not over P22,000. If the amount of the fraud exceeds P22,000, the penalty provided shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional P10,000. The total penalty, however, shall not exceed 20 years.<br><br>The range of the penalty provided for in Article 315 is composed of only two periods, thus, to get the maximum period of the indeterminate sentence, the total number of years included in the two periods should be divided into three.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Article 65<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the same code requires the division of the time included in the prescribed penalty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> into three equal periods of time, forming one period for each of the three portions. The maximum, medium and minimum periods of the prescribed penalty are therefore:<br><blockquote>Minimum period - 4 years, 2 months and 1 day to 5 years, 5 months and 10 days<br><br>Medium period - 5 years, 5 months and 11 days to 6 years, 8 months and 20 days<br><br>Maximum period - 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>The amount defrauded being in excess of P22,000, the penalty imposable should be the maximum period of six years, eight months, and 21 days to eight years of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor.</span>  However, Art. 315 also provides that an additional one year shall be imposed for each additional P10,000. The penalty should be termed as <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor or reclusion temporal,</span> as the case may be. Here, the total amount of the fraud is P244,000 (P244,000 – P22,000 = P222,000). Hence, an additional penalty of 22 years should be imposed.  However, the total penalty should not in any case exceed 20 years imprisonment. Thus, the correct imposable maximum penalty is 20 years of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion temporal.</span><br><br>The minimum period of the indeterminate sentence, on the other hand, should be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by Article 315 (1)(b), RPC for the crime committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The penalty next lower to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>maximum to <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> minimum is <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional</span> minimum (six months, one day to two years, four months) to prision correccional medium (two years, four months and one day to four years and two months).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals, therefore, computed correctly the minimum and maximum period of petitioner's sentence when it fixed the minimum sentence within the range of the penalty next lower in degree, four years and one day of prision correccional, and the maximum at 20 years of reclusion temporal.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.
