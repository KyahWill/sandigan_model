The following members of the B'laan Tribe were allowed to build their houses and till portions of the land, provided that they would deliver to Leyson 50% of their produce: Romeo Jarmin, Judith Jarmin, Mamer Bagon, Joel Bagon, Teresita Bagon, Lilia Bagon, Eddie Bagon, Pedro Bagon, Pedro Lawa, Jennifer Moso, Lino Mendi, Leah Taculod, Gloria P. Anda, Alicia B. Gilon, and Bonifacio Batata.<br><br>Romeo Jarmin built his house on the ranch sometime in December 1993. The roof was made of cogon, the walls of split bamboo, and the side of a coconut tree was used for flooring. The portion of the ranch where he planted corn and palay was about 3 hectares.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Mamer Bagon, his brother-in-law, lived about 50 meters away from him, also in a house made of wood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Mamer Bagon planted palay, coconut trees and other agricultural plants and gave 50% of his produce to Leyson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Joel, Teresita, Lilia, Eddie, Pedro, all surnamed Bagon, also built their respective huts in the ranch. Pedro Lawa, who also built a house on the landholding, also delivered to Leyson his share of the produce from his agricultural crops as agreed upon.<br><br>However, on July 20, 1996, Leyson called all the farmers to a meeting and told them to vacate his ranch.  The farmers refused to leave the premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>At about 4:00 p.m. on September 1, 1996, Leyson and his son Winkie, together with his employees Ramon Soy, Dominador Bantulo, Juan Padayag and Eduardo Padayag and some policemen, arrived in the ranch. They were armed, and Leyson himself had a long firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They fired their guns at the farmers in an effort to drive them away from the land. Although no one was hurt, the farmers were petrified. They fled from the ranch and sought sanctuary at the <i>barangay</i> hall. The next day, Romeo Jarmin, Mamer Bagon, Bonifacio Batata and the other farmers returned to their houses to retrieve their farm animals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Leyson and his men threatened to inflict bodily harm on them unless they left the ranch. The farmers reported the incident to <i>Barangay</i> Captain Manuel Abadimas and to Benjamin Sumog-Oy, the Executive Assistant for Community Affairs of the City Mayor of General Santos City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At about 10:00 a.m. on September 7, 1996, Romeo Jarmin returned to his house in the ranch with Mamer Bagon and Bonifacio Batata.  Bonifacio Batata wanted to get his share of the agricultural crops from Alicia Gilon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Jarmin proceeded to the house of his brother-in-law, Mamer Bagon, and saw Leyson with his employees Rodolfo Padayag, Dominador Bantulo, Eduardo Bantulo, Eduardo Padayag, Eddie Padayag and Ramon Soy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Two of the men were armed with M-16 carbine rifles, another with an M-16 rifle, and yet another with an armalite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; When they saw the armed men, Jarmin and Batata hid in a canal near the cogon area. The armed men fired their guns in the air. One of them set fire on the houses of Mamer Bagon, Pedro Bagon, Alicia Gilon, Joel Bagon, Romeo Jarmin, Pedro Lawa. The houses of the other farmers were also set aflame. He, along with Mamer Bagon and Bonifacio Batata, watched as the houses burned down to mere rubble.

He averred, however, that the cost of the wood used in constructing the huts should not be included because the farmers had taken the same from his ranch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]&nbsp; </sup>Leyson stated that he would pay for the damages sustained by the farmers.<br><br><center><b>The Case for the Accused</b><br></center><br>Petitioners denied having burned the huts of the complainants and interposed the defense of alibi.<br><br>Leyson testified that his co-accused Dominador Bantulo, Eduardo Bantulo, Eduardo Padayag, Jun Padayag and Eddie Padayag, were employees in his eight-hectare farm located at Lower Nopol, Purok 7, <i>Barangay</i> Mabuhay, General Santos City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]&nbsp; </sup>Ramon Soy, however, was not his employee.

Romeo Jarmin was also employed as Leyson's "cowboy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Dominador denied any involvement in the burning of the farmers' houses. He claimed that he and his co-accused were harvesting corn in Leyson's farm in Lower Nopol from September 1 to 11, 1996.

They insisted that they were in the farm of Eduardo Leyson harvesting and loading corn from September 1 to 11, 1996.<br><br>Renilo Punay, a laborer of Pioneer Seeds Production, corroborated the testimony of the accused.  He narrated that he was the roving guard of the company and stayed with the men as they harvested and loaded corn for Pioneer Seeds Production from September 1 to 11, 1996.

The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision of the court <i>a quo</i> is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the modification that accused DOMINADOR BANTULO, EDUARDO BANTULO, EDUARDO PADAYAG, EDDIE PADAYAG and RODOLFO PADAYAG are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.

It took into account Leyson's admission that he would pay for the damages sustained by the private complainants.  The appellate court rejected as barren of factual basis the appellants' defenses of denial and alibi.<br><br>Leyson and his men filed a motion for reconsideration, which the appellate court denied; hence, the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, where petitioners submit the following contentions:<blockquote>BOTH COURTS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE IDENTITIES OF THE PERSONS WHO BURNED THE HOUSES OF PRIVATE RESPONDENTS WERE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED.

CIVILLY LIABLE TOGETHER WITH THE CONVICTED ACCUSED, THUS, THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEALS WRONGLY APPLIED THE LAW ON CIVIL LIABILITY OF AN ACCUSED IN A CRIMINAL CASE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>The issues to be resolved in the present case are: (1) whether the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of petitioner, except petitioner Leyson, of the crime of arson under Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code;     and (2) whether petitioner Leyson is civilly liable for alleged damages to the private complainants.<br><br>Petitioners aver that respondents failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt for arson.  The testimonies of respondent Romeo Jarmin and Bonifacio Batata were inconsistent with the affidavits given to the police investigators. While Jarmin pointed to and identified petitioner Eduardo Leyson during the trial as one of those who burned the houses, in his affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Jarmin failed to mention Leyson, and even erroneously declared that the men were "cowboys." Petitioners further point out that Jarmin had admitted that he returned to the farm only on September 2, 1996; hence, it was impossible for him to have seen the burning of the houses on September 11, 1996.<br><br>Bonifacio Batata admitted when he testified that even before the burning of the houses on September 7, 1996 he already knew petitioner Leyson, yet, never identified him as one of the perpetrators in the affidavit which he gave to the police investigators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, Batata, in his affidavit, never identified any of petitioners as the perpetrators. Moreover, Batata and Jarmin could not have seen the burning of the houses so as to properly identify the culprits, considering that the surface of the canal where they claim to have hidden was covered by three feet cogon grass, and Jarmin and Batata were only 5 feet and four inches tall. While Batata declared that he saw petitioners burn the houses of private respondents, he later changed his testimony and declared that he saw only one of them setting the houses on fire.  Batata even admitted that he did not see the face of the arsonist. And contrary to the ruling of the CA, Lino Mendi did not see the burning of the houses.<br><br>Petitioners conclude that conformably with the aphorism <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i>, the testimonies of Jarmin and Batata have no probative weight.<br><br>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General asserts that the ruling of the CA is buttressed by the testimonial and documentary evidence on record.  The alleged inconsistencies between the testimonies of Jarmin and Batata and their respective affidavits pertain to minor and peripheral matters, and did not necessarily discredit them. The OSG asserts that Leyson, having been acquitted merely on reasonable doubt, is nevertheless civilly liable to private respondents.  It points out that he even obliged himself to pay for the damages sustained by private respondents.<br><br>We agree with the rulings of the RTC and the CA that petitioners conspired to burn the houses of private respondents on September 7, 1996.<br><br>Well-entrenched rule is that the findings of the trial court, affirmed by the CA on appeal, are accorded with high respect, if not conclusive effect by this Court. The assessment by the trial court of the credibility of the witnesses and its calibration of the probative weight thereof are even conclusive on this Court, absent clear evidence that facts and circumstances of substance which if considered would alter or reverse the outcome of the case were ignored, misinterpreted or misconstrued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The testimony of a witness must be considered in its entirety instead of in truncated parts.  The technique in deciphering a testimony is not to consider only its isolated parts and anchor a conclusion on the basis of said parts.  In ascertaining the facts established by a witness, everything stated by him on direct, cross and redirect examinations must be calibrated and considered.<br><br>It must be stressed that facts imperfectly or erroneously stated in answer to one question may be supplied or explained as qualified by his answer to other question. The principle <i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i> is not strictly applied in this jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp; The doctrine deals only with the weight of evidence and is not a positive rule of law, and the same is not an inflexible one of universal application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; The testimony of a witness can be believed as to some facts and disbelieved as to others:<blockquote>Nor can we subscribe to the proposition that since the trial court did not give credit to Edwin and Lina's testimonies that they positively identified Edgardo, it should, pursuant to the maxim "<i>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i>," likewise disregard their testimonies as against the appellant and accordingly acquit him.  In <i>People vs. Dasig</i>, this Court stated that the maxim is not a mandatory rule of evidence, but rather a permissible inference that the court may or may not draw.  In <i>People vs. Pacada</i>, we stated that the testimony of a witness can be believed as to some facts and disbelieved as to others.  And in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Osias</span>, we ruled that:<blockquote>It is perfectly reasonable to believe the testimony of a witness with respect to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other facts.  And it has been aptly said that even when witnesses are found to have deliberately falsified in some material particulars, it is not required that the whole of their uncorroborated testimony be rejected but such portions thereof deemed worthy of belief may be credited.<br><br>The primordial consideration is that the witness was present at the scene of the crime and that he positively identified [the accused] as one of the perpetrators of the crime charged x x x.-</blockquote>Professor Wigmore gives the following enlightening commentary:<blockquote>"It may be said, once for all, that the maxim is in itself worthless —first, in point of validity, because in one form it merely contains in loose fashion a kernel of truth which no one needs to be told, and in the others, it is absolutely false as a maxim of life; and secondly, in point of utility, because it merely tells the jury what they may do in any event, not what they must do or must not do, and therefore it is a superfluous form of words.  It is also in practice pernicious, first, because there is frequently a misunderstanding of its proper force, and secondly, because it has become in the hands of many counsel a mere instrument for obtaining new trials upon points wholly unimportant in themselves."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>The general rule is that inconsistencies and discrepancies between the testimony of a witness in contrast with what he stated in an affidavit do not necessarily discredit him. Affidavits given to police and <i>barangay</i> officers are made <i>ex parte</i> and often incomplete or incorrect for lack or absence of sufficient inquiries by the investigating officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]&nbsp; </sup>It is of judicial knowledge that sworn statements are almost incomplete and often inaccurate and are generally inferior to the testimony of a witness in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Inconsistencies or discrepancies in the testimony of the witness relative to minor or peripheral matters and not to the significant facts vital to the guilt or innocence of the accused from the crime charged or the elements of such crime are not grounds for the acquittal of the accused.<br><br>It is not correct for petitioners to claim that Jarmin<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> in his affidavit, did not implicate petitioner Leyson for the burning of the houses. In fact, Jarmin declared therein that petitioner Leyson conspired with his co-petitioners to burn the houses of private respondents because they refused to vacate the ranch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  Moreover, petitioner Leyson, with his co-petitioners, was present when the houses were burned on September 7, 1996, as he was even armed with a long firearm.  Petitioner Leyson even assured Sumog-oy later that he would pay for the damages sustained by private respondents.

But whether petitioners were the farmhands or cowboys of petitioner Leyson is of little significance.  The fact of the matter is that petitioner Leyson employed his co-petitioners, who were given long firearms when they drove away the private respondents from the farm on September 1 to 2, 1996; and on September 7, 1996, they fired shots and burned private respondents" houses.<br><br>Petitioner Leyson ordered his men to intimidate the private respondents with bodily harm if they did not leave the ranch.

However, when queried by the trial court if he returned to the farm after September 2, 1996, Jarmin declared that he came back on September 2 and on September 7, 1996:<blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Did you not return on September 2?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I returned there to get some vegetables and to get my carabao.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">So that was the only time you returned?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">On September 2, 1996?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The last time to go there was on September 7.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify">Proceed.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

Indeed, the only persons who returned to the farm on September 7, 1996, were Jarmin himself, Mamer Bagon and Batata. The other private respondents no longer returned to their farmhouses.<br><br>We agree with petitioners' contention that Lino Mendi did not witness the burning of his house and the houses of the other private respondents  on September 7, 1996 and that he learned of the burning and all the perpetrators thereof only from Batata and Jarmin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> However, the thrust of Mendi's testimony was only for the purpose of proving the actual damages he sustained, consisting of the value of his house and his other personal belongings which were burned. Likewise of minimal significance is the seeming discrepancy between the testimony of Jarmin, that petitioners burned the houses of private respondents, and the testimony of Batata, that only one of petitioners whose face he did not actually see burned the houses.<br><br>Considering the entirety of the testimonies of Batata and Jarmin, they declared that all the petitioners were responsible for the burning because of their collective acts, including those that transpired on September 1 and 2, 1996.  By their collective acts, petitioners (except petitioner Leyson) conspired to burn the houses of private respondents.  It is elementary that when there is a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all the conspirators, and <i>a conspirator may be held as a principal even if he did not participate in the actual commission of every act constituting the offense</i>.&nbsp; In conspiracy, all those who in one way or another helped and cooperated in the consummation of the crime are considered co-principals since the degree or character of the individual participation of each conspirator in the commission of the crime becomes immaterial.&nbsp; Thus, <i>liability exists notwithstanding appellant's non-participation in every detail in the execution of the crime.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, Batata testified that petitioners, who were in the company of petitioner Leyson, burned private respondents' houses.

Denial and alibi are weak defenses in criminal prosecution: alibi is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove, while denial is mere self-serving evidence which cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of witnesses who identified the perpetrators.  To merit approbation, clear and convincing evidence must be adduced to show that petitioners were in a place other than the <i>situs</i> of the crime when it was committed, such that it was physically impossible for them to have committed the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; In this case, it was not impossible for petitioners to rush to the ranch of petitioner Leyson from his farm which was only 5 to 6 kms away on horseback, arrive there at 10:00 a.m., fire their guns and burn the houses of private respondents.<br><br>The trial court acquitted petitioner Leyson of arson but ruled that he is civilly liable to private respondents.  The CA affirmed the ruling of the court <i>a quo</i>.   We quote with approval the ruling of the appellate court:<blockquote>Finally, the rule is that a person's acquittal of a crime on the ground that his guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt does not bar a civil action for damages founded on the same acts involved in the offense.  Rule 111, Section 2(b) of the Revised Rules of Court provides: "Extinction of the penal action does not carry with it extinction of the civil, <b>unless the extinction proceeds from a declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist.</b>"  It is also an established rule that the acquittal of an accused on reasonable doubt is not generally an impediment to the imposition, in the same criminal action, of civil liability for damages on said accused.  In the case at bar, there is no finding by the court <i>a quo</i> that the houses of the complainants were not burned which is the basis of the civil liability of appellant Leyson.  Leyson was acquitted for lack of evidence to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote>Besides, petitioner Leyson obliged himself to pay for the damages sustained by private respondents.<br><br><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
