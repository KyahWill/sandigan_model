				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the exercise of its power under Section 10 of RA 9160,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) issued freeze orders against various bank accounts of respondents. The frozen bank accounts were previously found <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> to be related to the unlawful activities of respondents.<br><br>Under RA 9160, a freeze order issued by the AMLC is effective for a period not exceeding 15 days unless extended <span style="font-style: italic;">"upon order of the court</span>." Accordingly, before the lapse of the period of effectivity of its freeze orders, the AMLC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed with the Court of Appeals (CA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> various petitions for extension of effectivity of its freeze orders.<br><br>The  AMLC invoked the jurisdiction of the CA in the belief that the power given to the CA to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) or writ of injunction against any freeze order issued by the AMLC carried with it the power to extend the effectivity of a freeze order. In other words, the AMLC interpreted the phrase "upon order of the court" to refer to the CA.<br><br>However, the CA disagreed with the AMLC and dismissed the petitions. It uniformly ruled that it was not vested by RA 9160 with the power to extend a freeze order issued by the AMLC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Hence, these consolidated petitions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> which present a common issue: which court has jurisdiction to extend the effectivity of a freeze order?<br><br>During the pendency of these petitions, or on March 3, 2003, Congress enacted RA 9194 (An Act Amending Republic Act No. 9160, Otherwise Known as the "Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It amended Section 10 of RA 9160 as follows:<br><br>SEC. 7. Section 10 of [RA 9160] is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 10. <span style="font-style: italic;">Freezing of Monetary Instrument or Property</span>. - The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Court of Appeals</span>, upon application ex parte by the AMLC and after determination that probable cause exists that any monetary instrument or property is in any way related to an unlawful activity as defined in Sec. 3(i) hereof, may issue a freeze order which shall be effective immediately. The freeze order    shall be for a period of twenty (20) days <span style="font-weight: bold;">unless extended by the court</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 12 of RA 9194 further provides:<br><blockquote>SEC 12. <span style="font-style: italic;">Transitory Provision</span>. - Existing freeze orders issued by the AMLC shall remain in force for a period of thirty (30) days after the effectivity of this Act, unless extended by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Court of Appeals</span>. (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On April 3, 2003, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a "Very Urgent Motion to Remand Cases to the Honorable Court of Appeals (with Prayer for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The OSG prayed for the remand of these cases to the CA pursuant to RA 9194. It also asked for the issuance of a TRO on the ground that the freeze orders would be automatically lifted on April 22, 2003 by operation of law and the money or deposits in the concerned bank accounts may be taken out of the reach of law enforcement authorities. The OSG further manifested that pending in the CA were 29 other cases involving the same issue. It requested that these cases be included in the coverage of the TRO prayed for.<br><br>On April 21, 2003, the Court issued a TRO in these cases and in all other similar cases pending before all courts in the Philippines. Respondents, the concerned banks, and all persons acting in their behalf were directed to give full force and effect to existing freeze orders until further orders from this Court.<br><br>On May 5, 2003, the OSG informed the Court that on April 22, 2003 the CA issued a resolution in CA-G.R. SP No. 69371 (the subject of G.R. No. 154694) granting the petition for extension of freeze orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Hence, the OSG prayed for the dismissal of G.R. No. 154694 for being moot. It also reiterated its earlier prayer for the remand of G.R. Nos. 154522, 155554 and 155711 to the CA.<br><br>The amendment by RA 9194 of RA 9160 erased any doubt on the jurisdiction of the CA over the extension of freeze orders. As the law now stands, it is solely the CA which has the authority to issue a freeze order as well as to extend its effectivity. It also has the exclusive jurisdiction to extend existing freeze orders previously issued by the AMLC <span style="font-style: italic;">vis-Ã -vis</span> accounts and deposits related to money-laundering activities.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, G.R. No. 154694 is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span> for being moot while G.R. Nos. 154522, 155554 and 155711 are <span style="font-weight: bold;">REMANDED</span> to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action. Pending resolution by the Court of Appeals of these cases, the April 21, 2003 temporary restraining order is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">MAINTAINED</span>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Sandoval-Gutierrez, (Acting Chairperson), Azcuna,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairperson),</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">J.</span> on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001.
