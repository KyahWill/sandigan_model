Floro in the said amount of P600,000.00<br><br>Contrary to law."</span><br><br>Evidence adduced by the Prosecution tend to establish that herein private respondent Yolanda G. Floro is engaged in the business of buying and selling of jewelry since 1985.&nbsp; She regularly conducts business at her residence located at No. 51 Interior, Poblacion, Meycauayan, Bulacan.&nbsp; Sometimes, though, it was Floro who would personally visit her customers to show and offer them the pieces of jewelry.&nbsp; Herein accused-appellant/petitioner Joy Lee Recuerdo, on the other hand, a dentist by profession, who was introduced to Floro by the latter's cousin Aimee Aoro in the first week of December 1993, became her customer.&nbsp; Sometime in the second week of December 1993, at around 7:30 in the evening, Recuerdo went to the house of Floro in Meycauayan, Bulacan and purchased from her two pieces of jewelry, to wit:&nbsp; a 2.19 carat diamond round stone in white gold setting worth P220,000.00 pesos, and one piece of loose 1.55 karat marquez diamond with a value of P130,000.00 pesos.<br><br>For the 2.19 carat diamond stone, accused issued and delivered to the complainant then and there ten post-dated checks each in the amount of P22,000.00 drawn against Unitrust Development Bank, Makati Commercial Center Branch.&nbsp; Only six (6) postdated checks, to wit:&nbsp; Checks Nos. 014356, 014357, 014358, 014359 and 014360 are subject of Criminal Case No. 2750-M-94.&nbsp; For the 1.55 carat marquez loose diamond, accused issued and delivered to complainant then and there ten (10) postdated checks, each in the amount of P13,000.00 drawn against PCI Bank, Makati, Dela Rosa Branch.&nbsp; Six of those checks are subject of Criminal Case No. 2807-M-94, to wit:&nbsp; Checks Nos. 053051983A, 053051984A, 053051985A, 053051986A and 053051987A, subject matter of Crim. Case No. 2751-M-94.<br><br>In yet another transaction that transpired in the early evening of February 7, 1994, Recuerdo once again proceeded at Floro's house in Meycauayan, Bulacan and bought another set of jewelry, this time a pair of diamond earrings worth P768,000.00 pesos.&nbsp; She was given seven (7) postdated checks one for P168,000.00 as downpayment and another six (6) postdated checks drawn against <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prudential Bank</span>, Legaspi Village, Makati Branch, each for P100,000.00 representing the balance in the aggregate amount of P600,000.00 pesos (Checks Nos. 100783, 01184, 01185, 011786, 011787 and 011788, Record, Criminal Case No. 2750-M-94, pp. 138-150) subject matter of Crim. Case No. 2751-M-94.<br><br>Floro deposited the aforementioned checks at Liberty Savings &amp; Loan Association, Meyc[a]uayan, Bulacan.&nbsp; Upon presentment for encashment by said depositary bank with the different drawee banks on their respective maturity dates, the six (6) Prudential Bank checks were all dishonored for having been drawn against closed accounts.&nbsp; With her pieces of jewelry still unpaid, Floro, through counsel, made formal demands requiring Requerdo to pay the amounts represented by the dishonored checks (Record, supra, pp. 123, 138, and 151).&nbsp; Floro's efforts to obtain payment, though, only proved futile as Requerdo continuously refused to pay the value of the purchased pieces of jewelry.<br><br>Upon her arraignment on March 1, 1995 in Criminal Case No. 2807-M-94, and on April 4, 1995 in Criminal Case Nos. 2750-M-94 and 2751-M-94,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recuerdo, with the assistance of counsel, pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; (Record, Criminal Case No. 2807-M-94, p. 40; Criminal Case No. 2750-M-94, p. 58).&nbsp; Considering the identity of the parties concerned, and the nature of the transactions from which the charges of Estafa trace its roots, the three criminal cases were consolidated.&nbsp; Joint trial then ensured.&nbsp; Recuerdo, on separate dates, posted three Personal Bail Bonds to obtain provisional liberty (Record, Criminal Case No. 2750-M-94, p. 21; 2807-M-94, p. 27; 2751-M-94, p. 17).<br><br>By way of defense, Recuerdo posited the theory that the trial court of Malolos, Bulacan is devoid of jurisdiction to take cognizance of the criminal cases against her, insisting that all the essential elements of the crime of Estafa involving the bad checks occurred at the City of Makati, in that, all her business transactions with Floro, to wit; the purchase of the pieces of jewelry and the subsequent issuance of and delivery of the subject bank checks in payment thereof which eventually&nbsp; bounced, all took place and were executed at her Dental Clinic located at the Medical Towers at Suite 306, Herrera corner Ormaza Streets Legaspi Village Makati City.&nbsp; Furthermore, Recuerdo argued that her act of issuing the dishonored checks does not constitute the offense of Estafa considering that the subject checks were not issued and delivered to Floro simultaneous to the purchase of the pieces of jewelry, but only several days thereafter, when she had already thoroughly examined the jewelry and is fully satisfied of its fine quality (TSN, Joy Lee Recuerdo, January 16, 1996, pp. 3-18).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>On July 28, 1997, the trial court rendered a Joint Decision convicting petitioner Joy Lee Recuerdo of two counts of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">fallo</span> of the decision reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused JOY LEE RECUERDO GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315, par. 2[b] (sic) of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences her as follows:<br><ol><li>In Criminal Case Nos. 2750-M-94 and 2807-M-94, to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) years and one (1) day of prison correccional as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day reclusion temporal as maximum and to pay Yolanda Floro by way of civil indemnity the amount of P210,000.00 pesos plus interest from the filing of the information until fully paid; and<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. 2751-M-94, to suffer an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum and to pay Yolanda Floro by way of civil indemnity the amount of P600,000.00 pesos plus interest from the filing of the information until fully paid.<br></li></ol>In both cases, accused shall pay the costs of the suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner appealed the decision to the CA on the following assignment of errors:<blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I.</div><br>The Regional Trial Court erred in finding that the Municipal Trial Court, Meycauayan, Bulacan, Branch I did not pass upon the merits of the criminal cases filed against the petitioner by confining and limiting itself merely to the dispositive portion of the Joint Decision dated 28 January 1998 rendered by the latter court, instead of reading the Joint Decision as a whole to get its true meaning and intent.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.</div><br>The Regional Trial Court erred in affirming the judgment of conviction rendered by the Municipal Trial Court, Meycauayan, Bulacan, Branch II which is in derogation of the petitioner's right against double jeopardy considering that the latter was previously acquitted of the same criminal cases by the Municipal Trial Court of Meycauayan, Bulacan, Branch I.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.</div><br>The Regional Trial Court erred in finding that all proceedings in the court a quo have been made in the presence and with the authority of the public prosecutor, in the face of the undisputed fact that the appeal initiated by the private respondent is fatally defective because it was filed without the concurrence, permission and authority of the public prosecutor, in this case, the provincial prosecutor of Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner averred that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the offenses charged because the crimes were committed in Makati City and not in Malolos, Bulacan where the Informations were filed.&nbsp; The prosecution failed to prove the essential element of deceit because she drew and delivered the postdated checks to the private complainant after the jewelries had been delivered.&nbsp; Moreover, she was denied the right to due process.<br><br>On August 23, 2004, the CA rendered judgment affirming with modification the decision of the RTC as to the penalty meted on the appellant.&nbsp; Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration insisting that based on the evidence on record, out of the 17 subject checks, nine were honored by the drawee banks.&nbsp; Moreover, she made partial payments of the amounts of the subject checks while the case was pending in the CA.&nbsp; Contrary to the finding of the trial court and the appellate courts that she acted with deceit when she drew and delivered the checks in payment of the pieces of jewelry she purchased from the private complainant, she in fact acted in good faith; hence, should be acquitted based on the decision of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Ojeda</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; The CA denied the motion on May 20, 2005.<br><br>Petitioner filed the instant petition contending that:<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS DECIDED THE CASE CONVICTING THE PETITIONER IN A WAY PROBABLY NOT IN ACCORD WITH –<blockquote><ol type="A"><li>THE BENEFICENT RULING OF THE SUPREME COURT ENUNCIATED IN PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES V.

Reyes, The Revised Penal Code, Thirteenth Edition 1993, Book Two, p. 693; People v.

Ramos</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court held that if an issue is raised only in the motion for reconsideration of the appellate court's decision, it is as if it was never raised in that court at all.<br><br>Petitioner's defense of good faith is even belied by the evidence of the prosecution and her own evidence. &nbsp;When the postdated checks issued by petitioner were dishonored by the drawee banks and the private complainant made demands for her to pay the amounts of the checks, she intransigently refused to pay; she insisted that she issued and delivered the postdated checks to the private complainant after the subject pieces of jewelry had been delivered to her.&nbsp; Petitioner never offered to pay the amounts of the checks after she was informed by the private complainant that they had been dishonored by the drawee banks, the private complainant thus charged her with estafa before the RTC.&nbsp; It was only during the period of January 4, 2005 to June 27, 2005, after the CA promulgated its decision affirming the decision of the trial court, that petitioner made several payments to the private complainant.&nbsp; While petitioner appended the deposit slips<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> to her motion for reconsideration in the CA and her petition in this Court, there is no showing as to which checks they were made in payment for.&nbsp; In fine, it was the spectre of a long prison term which jolted petitioner into making remittances to the private complainant, after the CA affirmed the decision of the trial court and increased the penalty meted on her, and not because she had acted in good faith in her transactions with the private complainant.&nbsp; To reiterate, petitioner rejected the demands of the private complainant to pay the amounts of the dishonored checks.<br><br>While it is true that nine of the 17 postdated checks petitioner issued and delivered to the private complainant were honored by the drawee banks, such a circumstance is not a justification for her acquittal of the charges relative to the dishonored checks. &nbsp;The reimbursement or restitution to the offended party of the sums swindled by the petitioner does not extinguish the criminal liability of the latter. &nbsp;It only extinguishes <span style="font-style: italic;">pro tanto </span>the civil liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, estafa is a public offense which must be prosecuted and punished by the State on its own motion even though complete reparation had been made for the loss or damage suffered by the offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; The consent of the private complainant to petitioner's &nbsp;payment of her civil liability <span style="font-style: italic;">pendente lite </span>does not entitle the latter to an acquittal.&nbsp; &nbsp;Subsequent payments does not obliterate the criminal liability already incurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Criminal liability for estafa is not affected by a compromise between petitioner and the private complainant on the former's civil liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioner cannot find solace in the Court's ruling in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ojeda</span> case.&nbsp; The CA correctly refuted the submission of the petitioner in its decision, thus:<blockquote>This Court is in full agreement with the position advanced by the Office of the Solicitor General that on account of the glaring dissimilarities between the factual backdrop of the case of <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span>, on one hand, and the material facts obtaining in the case at bench, on the other, the doctrine in the former case may not be applied to benefit accused-appellant.&nbsp; Indeed, even accused-appellant herself was quick to admit that the facts of her case are <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">not entirely on all fours</span></span> with those that obtained in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span>.&nbsp; At the outset, emphasis must be made of the fact that the acquittal of the accused in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span> case was brought about by a combination of reasons not obtaining in the present case.&nbsp; First, the Supreme Court ruled out the existence of deceit and intent to defraud in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span> in view of the fact that the accused therein performed extraordinary efforts to gradually pay and settle her monetary obligations with the private complainant, and this convinced the High Court that the acts of the accused were not tainted with malice, bad faith and criminal intent. Verily, the accused in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span> case not only made determined and honest arrangements to pay the private complainant, but was likewise able to actually satisfy with completeness the sums she owed the latter, and this was evidenced by an affidavit of desistance where the private complainant categorically declared that the accused already paid in full her monetary obligations.&nbsp; The facts in the instant case, however, are totally different. Contrary to the contention of accused-appellant, she never made a determined and earnest effort to arrange and settle with Floro with the end in view of paying her monetary obligations.&nbsp; In truth, accused-appellant simply promised to pay Floro the value of the dishonored checks that were issued in payment for the pieces of jewelry.&nbsp; However, that was all there was to it, and lamentably said promise turned out to be an empty one as accused-appellant never made good her commitment to pay for the value of the dishonored checks. Accused-appellant never arranged a payment scheme with Floro, and as the facts of the case would disclose she never made any gradual payment to Floro as shown by the fact that the value of the dishonored checks remained unpaid, in direct contrast with the facts of the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span> case where the accused was able to pay in full.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that accused-appellant failed to perform any concrete act to show that she had the intention of paying Floro for the value of the purchased pieces of jewelry, in order to somehow rebut the fact duly established by the prosecution that deceit attended her business dealings with Floro.&nbsp; It must be reiterated that We have found that accused-appellant issued the subject bank checks as payment for the pieces of jewelry simultaneous with her transactions with Floro, and that was, on the very same occasion when the pieces of jewelry were purchased, first, on the second week of December 1993, and subsequently, on February 7, 1994. It being clear that the subject bank checks were issued simultaneous with said transactions, it likewise became evident that deceit attended accused-appellants' dealings with Floro for the same only goes to show that the bum checks were issued to Floro in order to induce her to part with the pieces of jewelry in favor of accused-appellant.<br><br>In addition to the foregoing, the High Court likewise found in the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ojeda</span></span> case that the prosecution miserably failed to adduce evidence to establish that the indispensable element of notice of dishonor was sent to and was received by the accused therein.&nbsp; In the case at bench, however, it is undisputed that after the dishonor of the subject bank checks Floro, through counsel, made repeated formal demands requiring accused-appellant to pay for the value of the bum checks, perforce the notice of dishonor which is required to properly prosecute and eventually convict an accused of the crime of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code has been sufficiently met.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</span>, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.&nbsp; The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Austria-Martinez,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Rosmari D.
