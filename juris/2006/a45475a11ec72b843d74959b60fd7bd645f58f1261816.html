In his Compliance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to the intestate court's directive to state his objections in writing, he alleged that IAC had occupied Lot No. 2194 long before the approval of the project of partition, and that the agreement was for IAC to cede Lot Nos. 2194 and 2380 in favor of Anacoreta and Beethoven in exchange for the latter's share in Lot No. 1863-B.&nbsp; He also claimed that IAC had already harvested the produce therefrom. The pleading contained the following prayer:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, it is respectfully prayed of the Honorable Court that the Order of December 20, 1991 be set aside and that the special administrators be ordered to submit a new project of partition as reflected in a new sketch plan after all the foregoing grounds for objection as enumerated in this COMPLIANCE are threshed and ironed out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>In view of this objection, Attys.

Beethoven Buenaventura, respondent's brother and counsel, had agreed to the swapping of the lots before the hearing on October 30, 1992.&nbsp; She knew that Michael Francisco and Beethoven Buenaventura represented the heirs, including herself, in the negotiation for the allotment of the estate.&nbsp; After Michael Francisco and Beethoven Buenaventura informed her of the terms and conditions of the settlement of the estate, she never objected nor disavowed their authority to bind her to a swapping of the lots or the settlement of the estate.&nbsp; Atty. Buenaventura even signed the stenographic notes taken on October 30, 1992 for and in behalf of respondent.&nbsp; Petitioner insists that respondent objected to the swapping, for the first time, only when she learned of the low rate of rental of Lot No. 2194.&nbsp; As against the recommendation of the Joint Commissioners and a judicial consideration by the trial court of all the circumstances, such belated objection to the amended agreement should not prevail.&nbsp; She pointed out that the findings of facts of the Joint Commissioners, duly approved by the court, are those of the court and are presumptively correct.<br><br>Petitioner avers that it was not necessary for Atty. Beethoven Buenaventura, as respondent's counsel to be authorized in writing to agree to a swapping of the two lots for and in behalf of respondent, especially as the respective shares of the other heirs under the partition had already been delivered.&nbsp; Petitioner points out that a partition is not a conveyance but simply a separation and designation of that part of the estate which belongs to each heir, and cites the ruling in <i>Vda. de Reyes v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>to support her claim.<br><br>Respondent, for her part, avers that her counsel, Atty.

Beethoven Buenaventura as her counsel, she did so only after December 10, 1992, upon learning that the Joint Commissioners had agreed to revise the October 30, 1992 partition of the estate during the December 10, 1992 conference.&nbsp; This prompted respondent to secure the services of counsel and file a Manifestation on January 15, 1993 informing the trial court of her objection to the swapping.<br><br>It bears stressing that Michael Francisco was merely the <i>encargado</i> of the administratrix, a member of the Joint Commissioners tasked to effect a physical partition of the estate.&nbsp; Any recommendation made in such capacity is still subject to the action of the court after due notice to the heirs; unless and until all the parties are notified of any report/recommendation, thereafter duly heard by the court, the heirs cannot thereby be bound.<br><br>Moreover, respondent is not bound by the agreement of Atty. Beethoven Buenaventura on the partition of the estate agreed upon on October 30 and December 10, 1992 because the latter did so in his <i>personal capacity</i> as heir of the deceased and not for and in behalf of respondent.This is gleaned from his testimony:<blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="20%">ATTY.

Sorbito and Buenaventura was incomplete, in that the area was assigned only to Pedro Buenaventura and Luz Buenaventura,&nbsp; and Emilia Vail was not indicated therein, and that Lot Nos. 2380 and 2194 assigned to the IAC(which the latter had assigned to Anacoreta Buenaventura and Beethoven Buenaventura) were not colored with the color code agreed upon by the Joint Commissioners.&nbsp; <i>Michael Francisco did not interpose any objection to the December 20, 1991 partition relative to the allocation of Lot No. 2187-B to respondent.</i><br><br>As admitted by the IAC in its Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>filed on September 3, 1992, the technical plan prepared by Technical Assistant Pamposo Juanola was merely to satisfy the desire of Michael Francisco and to comply with his orders without any objection of the two other administrators and the IAC.&nbsp; This is gleaned from the affidavit of Juanola:<blockquote>That sometime on May 7, 1991, our firm headed by Engr. Antonio Y. Bincal, as Geodetic Engineer, was hired to conduct a survey over the property of the late Felipe Buenaventura, subject matter of Spec. Proc. No. 053 (130-3139), to determine the respective shares and the actual area of the heirs of the late Felipe Buenaventura and that of Ilog Agricultural Corporation;<br><br>That pursuant to the instructions and agreement of the three (3) co-administrators, Michael B. Francisco, Beethoven Buenaventura, and Nilo Sorbito, and in accordance with the instructions of Michael B. Francisco, I conducted the survey of the area and prepared a parcellary plan in accordance with the instructions of Michael B. Francisco with conformity of the two (2) co-administrators Beethoven Buenaventura and Nilo Sorbito;<br><br>That the plan was submitted to the Court last November 25, 1991, however, correction was made pursuant to the instructions of Michael B. Francisco, particularly as to the actual site/location of the area pertaining to Beethoven Buenaventura; vis-a-vis that of his mother Anacoreta B. Francisco;<br><br>That as instructed, I have prepared a new parcellary plan, copy of which is hereto attached as Annex "A" of this affidavit;<br><br>That when I prepared the parcellary plan, it is all in accordance with the instructions of Michael B. Francisco, with the conformity of [the] other co-administrators Beethoven Buenaventura and Nilo Sorbito.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>Michael Francisco's Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated November 26,1993 even states that the swapping was approved by the <i>co-administrators</i> and the trial court on December 10, 1992.&nbsp; Respondent was not present therein and could not thus have agreed to any swapping of the lots.<br><br>Even the IAC to which Lot No. 1871-B was assigned under the December 10, 1992 Order of the trial court, finally agreed to the lease by it of Lot No. 1871-B should the lot be assigned to respondent. What is so worrisome is that in its Order dated November 9, 1993, the trial court allotted Lot No. 1871-B to the IAC and, at the same time, declared that the distribution of Lot No. 1871-B and a portion of Lot No. 1294 would be held in abeyance.<b><br><br>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision of the Court of Appeals is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.<br><br></b><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Austria-Martinez, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ., </span>concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ynares-Santiago, J., </span>on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; Records, p. 122.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[2]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 120-121.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[3]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 14.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[4]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 121-122.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[5]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 122.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[6]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 123.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[8]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 120-124.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[9]</sup>&nbsp; Id. at 123.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[10]</sup> Id. at 118.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[11]</sup> Id. at 29-30.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[12]</sup> Id. at 33-34.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Id. at 41-43.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[14]</sup> Id. at 42.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[15]</sup> Id. at 141.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[16]</sup> Id. at 141-142.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[17]</sup> Id. at 54-55.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[18]</sup> Id. at 68-69.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[19]</sup> Id. at 84.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[20]</sup> Id. at 91.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[21]</sup> Id. at 94-97.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[22]</sup> Id. at 105-106.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[23]</sup> Id. at 139-144.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Id. at 134-135.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Id. at 145-147.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[26]</sup> Id. at 146-147.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, p. 28.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[28]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 29.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[29]</sup> Id. at 27-29.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><br><br>[30]</sup> G.R.
