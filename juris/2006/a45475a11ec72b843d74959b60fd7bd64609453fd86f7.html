Thus, the letter dated  18 October 1988  of petitioner-lessees is merely another counter-offer for the property in their continuing negotiation for the property. The latest offer of respondent-heirs was contained in their letter dated 3 November 1988 wherein only the 75% undivided interest of the property was for sale at  P3,825,000. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When petitioner-lessees opted not to respond to this offer, respondent-heirs had the right to sell the property to other buyers.</span><br><br>Petitioner-lessees already exercised their right of first refusal when they refused to respond to the latest offer of respondent-heirs, which amounted to a rejection of the offer.

Indeed, petitioner-lessees were given more than ample opportunity to purchase the property.<br><br>Petitioner-lessees allege that the price offered to Lita Sy was lower than the price offered to them. The records of the case reveal otherwise.<br><br>The last price which respondent-heirs offered to petitioner-lessees was<br><br>P3,825,000 for the 75% undivided interest in the property. The price of P3,825,000 was computed based on the price of  P5,100,000  for the entire property. Moreover, capital gains tax, documentary stamp tax, municipal transfer tax and registration expenses should be paid by petitioner-lessees. However, petitioner-lessees were only willing to pay   P5,000,000 for the entire property. Petitioner-lessees also indicated in their letter dated 8 October 1988 that unpaid taxes such as income, estate, realty &amp; science education fund and documentary stamps should be borne by the heirs of Dr. Lorenzo C. Reyes.<br><br>On the other hand, Lita Sy paid P3,825,000 for the 75%  undivided interest in the property. This is exclusive of the P412,500 which Lita Sy paid to Vicente M. Reyes for taxes, agent's commission and miscellaneous expenses. Thus, Lita Sy paid a total of P4,237,500.   Clearly, this amount is not lower than the price offered to petitioner-lessees.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Legal Redemption</span><br></div><br>The Villegas brothers maintain that Lita Sy failed to exercise her right of  redemption within the 30-day period prescribed under Article 1623 of the Civil Code.  According to the Villegas brothers,  Lita Sy received on 17 February 1989 a copy of the Deed of Sale evidencing the sale of the 25% portion of the property to the Villegas brothers.  However, it was only in a demand letter dated 29 March 1990 that Lita Sy invoked her right of redemption.<br><br>Articles 1620 and 1623 of the Civil Code provide:<br><blockquote>Art. 1620. A co-owner of a thing may exercise the right of redemption in case the shares of all the other co-owners or of any of them, are sold to a third person. If the price of the alienation is grossly excessive, the redemptioner shall pay only a reasonable one.<br><br>Should two or more co-owners desire to exercise the right of redemption, they may only do so in proportion to the share they may respectively have in the thing owned in common.<br><br>Art. 1623.

On the same date, Lita Sy also received together with the complaint the Deed of Sale of the 25% portion of the property.<br><br>Lita Sy and the other defendants in that case filed their answer on 16 March 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In their answer, Lita Sy invoked her right to redeem the property:<br><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><ol start="13"><li>That the Deed of Sale (Annex "N") in favor of the plaintiffs was based on a Transfer Certificate of Title No. 183718 (Annex "M") where defendant Lita Sy is already a co-owner to the extent of 36/48 portion on the subject property, which circumstance impliedly admits that defendants heirs have validly and legally disposed the 75% portion to defendant Lita Sy and plaintiffs are therefore estopped to deny it;<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">That as a co-owner with the sellers of the 25% portion of the subject lot, defendant Lita Sy has the right to redeem the shares disposed by the other co-owners in accordance with Art. 1620 of the New Civil Code and hereby exercise the same;</span><br><br></li><li>That the Deed of Sale (Annex "N"  Complaint) allegedly executed by the other heirs constituting twenty five (25%) percent of the subject property cannot as yet vest full ownership over the same until the co-owner defendant Lita Sy shall have failed or waived her rights to redeem the aforesaid 25% of the subject property in question;<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">P R A Y E R<br></div><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, it is respectfully prayed that after hearing a judgment be rendered dismissing the instant complaint for lack of merit and order the plaintiffs jointly and severally:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>e) <span style="font-weight: bold;">To sell or execute a Deed of Sale in favor of defendant Lita Sy covering the remaining 25% portion of the subject property in full exercise of the right of redemption under the law.</span><br><br>x x x x</blockquote>Lita Sy claims that the answer filed with the RTC Branch 2 is equivalent to a formal offer to redeem the 25% undivided interest in the property sold to the Villegas brothers.  Lita Sy also claims that since she offered to redeem the property on 16 March 1989, which is within 30 days from her receipt of the notice of the sale on 17 February 1989, she has complied with the condition fixed by law and may bring an action to enforce the redemption.<br><br>We hold that there was no valid and effective offer to redeem the 25% undivided interest in the property. Although Lita Sy invoked her right to redeem the property in the answer filed with the RTC Branch 2, she failed to consign in court the redemption price. Well-settled is the rule that a formal offer to redeem must be accompanied by a valid tender of the redemption price and that the filing of a judicial action, plus the consignation of the redemption price within the period of redemption, is equivalent to a formal offer to redeem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><blockquote>As held by this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tolentino v. Court of Appeals</span>:<br><br>[A] formal offer to redeem, accompanied by a bona fide tender of the redemption price, although proper, is not essential where, as in the instant case, the right to redeem is exercised thru the filing of a judicial action, which as noted earlier was made simultaneously with the deposit of the redemption price with the Sheriff, within the period of redemption. The formal offer to redeem, accompanied by a bona fide tender of the redemption price within the period of redemption prescribed by law, is only essential to preserve the right of redemption for future enforcement even beyond such period of redemption. The filing of the action itself, within the period of redemption, is equivalent to a formal offer to redeem. Should the court allow redemption, the redemptioners should then pay the amount already adverted to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>The importance of a valid tender or consignation of the redemption price was sufficiently explained by Justice J.B.L. Reyes in <span style="font-style: italic;">Conejero v. Court of Appeals:</span><br><blockquote>It is not difficult to discern why the redemption price should either be fully offered in legal tender or else validly consigned in court. Only by such means can the buyer become certain that the offer to redeem is one made seriously and in good faith. A buyer can not be expected to entertain an offer of redemption without attendant evidence that the redemptioner can, and is willing to, accomplish the repurchase immediately. A different rule would leave the buyer open to harrassment by speculators or crackpots, as well as to unnecessary prolongation of the redemption period, contrary to the policy of the law. While consignation of the tendered price is not always necessary because legal redemption is not made to discharge a pre-existing debt (Asturias Sugar Central versus Cane Molasses Co., 60 Phil 253), a valid tender is indispensable, for the reasons already stated. Of course, consignation of the price would remove all controversy as to the petitioner's ability to pay at the proper time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Conejero,</span> the Court held that to effectively exercise the right of redemption, the offer to redeem the property within the 30-day period  must be accompanied by a reasonable and valid tender of the entire repurchase price. The Court held:<br><blockquote>[Conejero] failed to make a valid tender of the price of the sale paid by the Raffiñans within the period fixed by law. Conejero merely offered a check for P10,000, which was not even legal tender and which the Raffiñans rejected, in lieu of the price of P28,000 recited in the deed of sale. The factual finding of the Court of Appeals to this effect is final and conclusive. Nor were the vendees obligated to accept Conejero's promise to pay the balance by means of a loan to be obtained in futuro from a bank. Bona fide redemption necessarily imports a reasonable and valid tender of the entire repurchase price, and this was not done. There is no cogent reason for requiring the vendee to accept payment by installments from a redemptioner, as it would ultimately result in an indefinite extension of the 30-day redemption period, when the purpose of the law in fixing a short and definite term is clearly to avoid prolonged and anti-economic uncertainty as to ownership of the thing sold (cf Torrijos vs. Crisologo, et al., G.R. No. L-1773, Sept. 29, 1962).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote>In this case, Lita Sy failed to consign in court the redemption price when she invoked her right to redeem the 25% portion of the property in the answer filed with the RTC Branch 2. The evidence does not show that Lita Sy ever tendered the redemption price to the Villegas brothers. Even when Lita Sy's lawyer sent a letter dated 29 March 1990 reiterating the demand for the Villegas brothers to resell the 25%  interest in the property, still no tender of the redemption price was made. There is likewise no evidence that Lita Sy consigned the redemption price in court when she filed  on 18 May 1990  a complaint for Specific Performance against the heirs of Atanacio Villegas, as represented by Soledad de Ocampo, Agripino Villegas, and Ofelia R. Tungol.<br><br>Considering that there was no tender of the redemption price, nor was there consignation of the redemption price, we hold that there was no valid exercise of the right of redemption.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE, </span> we <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENY</span> the petition in G.R.
