				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For review before the court is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 6 August 1997 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Branch 32, of Agoo, La Union, finding appellant Gregorio Carpio @ Gorio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of the crime of statutory rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in each case.<br><br>On 4 March 1994, appellant was charged with two counts of rape in two (2) separate Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> filed by 2nd Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Rogelio C. Hipol, the texts of which read:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Criminal Case No. A-2758</span><br></div><br>That sometime in the year 1991, when the aforenamed [AAA]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was still 9 years old, in the Municipality of Rosario, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by using force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the aforenamed offended girl against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Criminal Case No. A-2759</span><br></div><br>That sometime in the month of June to the middle of August, [sic] 1993, when the aforenamed [AAA] was still 10 or 11 years old, in the Municipality of Rosario, Province of La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by using force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the aforenamed offended girl and against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>When arraigned, appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Trial promptly ensued thereafter. The prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) AAA, the minor victim; (2) BBB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> mother of the victim; and (3) Dr. Elflida Bautista, Medico-Legal Officer II of the Doña Gregoria Memorial Hospital, Agoo, La Union. The prosecution sought to establish the following facts:<br><br>AAA is the natural child of BBB, born on 20 October 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> At the time of her pregnancy and after giving birth, BBB stayed with her aunt Gloria Carpio and the latter's husband Gregorio, appellant herein. The Carpio spouses wanted to adopt AAA, but BBB did not consent to such. When she was capacitated to return to work, BBB entrusted her child to the care of her mother CCC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and not the Carpio spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The sexual assault on AAA began sometime in 1991, when the child was nine (9) years old and a Grade 2 pupil at Damortis Elementary School in Nagtagaan, Rosario, La Union.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> She was living with her grandmother CCC in Nagtagaan, about 25 meters away from the house of appellant. She lived there and not with her mother because Nagtagaan was nearer her school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Around after lunch on the day she was raped, the appellant summoned AAA from her home to remove his earwax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He brought her to a <span style="font-style: italic;">nipa </span>hut, about only six (6) meters away from his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> After removing the earwax of appellant, he brought her to the room of his house. The appellant locked the door, lay the victim on the bed and undressed her. Thereafter, he removed her panties and forcibly inserted his finger and penis in her vagina. The victim cried in pain, but every time she would cry out "<span style="font-style: italic;">Mama,</span>" the appellant would spank or pinch or slap her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>When the appellant had finished ravishing the victim, he dragged her to the bathroom to perform <span style="font-style: italic;">fellatio</span> on him. AAA refused. She was later allowed to go home, but not before the accused threatened her to keep silent about what had happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  When AAA went home, she did not report the incident to her grandmother or to anyone else.<br><br>According to AAA, the abuse continued until 1993. In the three (3) years that AAA was repeatedly raped by the appellant, she never told anyone of her ordeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> According to AAA, the rape would always occur after lunch, when the appellant's wife and children were not around.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> She was afraid to tell her mother out of fear that she might be castigated or reprimanded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On 25 December 1993, BBB invited Julieta Flores,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> a <span style="font-style: italic;">kumadre</span> and neighbor in Nagtagaan, to join them for Christmas celebrations in their house in Agoo. On the same day, AAA was with CCC in Nagtagaan for festivities thereat. It was on this occasion that BBB learned from Julieta Flores the perfidious acts committed by the appellant. Flores told her that sometime a few years back, she had seen appellant drag AAA to a dark place behind his house. Although it was almost dusk, she could see that appellant kissing AAA. When she saw them in that position, she made a coughing sound which prompted the appellant to look back and bring AAA to the front of his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>BBB was unnerved by her talk with her <span style="font-style: italic;">kumadre.</span> Thus, on 27 December 1993, she went to Nagtagaan to see her daughter. When she asked her daughter about what she had heard, it was then that AAA broke down and told her mother about what appellant had been doing to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The following day, on 28 December 1993, BBB took AAA to the Doña Gregoria Memorial Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The medical examination conducted on AAA revealed that AAA's genetalia bore reddish discoloration, with "old hymenal lacerations at 9 and 3:00 o'clock positions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Dr. Elflida Bautista (Dr. Bautista), who examined AAA, testified that she examined AAA when the child was just eleven (11) years old and found old lacerations of the hymen which could have been obtained two (2) months to two (2) years prior to the examination. Dr. Bautista opined that the two lacerations she found on the hymen of AAA are not normal to an 11-year old child whose hymen should still be intact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In his defense, appellant, on the other hand, unsurprisingly espoused an altogether different scenario. He presented the following witnesses to bolster his claims: (1) DDD,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> great-grandmother of AAA and mother-in-law of the appellant; (2) Cipriano Lagao, teacher at Damortis Elementary School; (3) Gloria Carpio, wife of appellant and half-sister of CCC; (4) Lydia Mapalo, friend of appellant; (5) Bartolome De Mesa, owner of a cockpit in Aringay, La Union; (6) Santiago Reyes, manager of a cockpit in Sto. Tomas, La Union; and (7) EEE,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> sister of BBB. Appellant likewise testified on his behalf.<br><br>The defense of appellant consisted of denial and alibi. He asserted that in 1991, AAA was staying in the house of Gloria Dumo, sister of BBB, and the former's husband Alfredo Dumo, in Damortis, Sto. Tomas, La Union. He further maintained that AAA stayed with the Dumo couple from the time she was in Grade 1 until Grade 4.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Appellant denied that he raped AAA in 1991 in their <span style="font-style: italic;">nipa</span> hut and house in Nagtagaan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellant endeavored to prove that he was a <span style="font-style: italic;">sentenciador</span> in four (4) cockpits within the La Union area, presenting several certifications to that effect. He explained that he would report for work between 9 o'clock and 9:30 in the morning and would leave work at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Therefore, although AAA would frequently visit his house from 1991 to 1993 to play with his daughter, he was never home or that he would not talk to her and leave the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> His duty at the cockpits would be from Thursday to Sunday. On Mondays to Wednesdays, the appellant claims to have been in the house of Gregorio and witness Lydia Mapalo where they played <span style="font-style: italic;">mahjong.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This was corroborated by the testimony of appellant's wife, Gloria Carpio, who averred that whenever she would see AAA, her husband would either be playing <span style="font-style: italic;">mahjong</span> or working at the cockpit. Moreover, although she was a barangay official, her work did not require her to be constantly present at the barangay hall. Thus, she would be home everyday to care for the house and her small child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Appellant theorizes that the charges against him might have been propelled by the quarrel between the victim's mother and his wife. This alleged quarrel happened more than a decade past, sometime in 1980, with BBB purportedly uttering the words, "<span style="font-style: italic;">I will make an accusation against your husband</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Appellant further implicates another relative, Alfredo Dumo, as the possible perpetrator of the rapes imputed to him. Alfredo Dumo is the husband of BBB's sister, and an uncle by affinity of AAA. Appellant claims that after he was apprehended and detained in the provincial jail of San Fernando, La Union,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> he was visited by his mother-in-law, DDD, who then told him that it was Dumo who had raped AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This claim was attested to by DDD in her testimony before the trial court. She narrated that after she was hospitalized, she stayed in the house of CCC for three (3) months in 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> During one of her stays in the house of CCC, at around 12 o'clock in the evening, she witnessed Alfredo Dumo, in his briefs, bending and walking towards AAA, who was asleep in the sala of the house with CCC and the former's cousin. Allegedly, Alfredo went under AAA's blanket, on top of the victim and started the "push and pull" movement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Notwithstanding, the trial court found appellant guilty of rape on both counts and sentenced him in each case to<span style="font-style: italic;"> reclusion perpetua</span>, to indemnify the victim for damages in the amount of P50,000.00, and to pay costs of the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Conformably with this Court's decision in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Mateo,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> appellant's appeal by way of automatic review was transferred to the Court of Appeals. On 17 October 2005, the appellate court rendered its decision affirming the appellant's conviction, but with modification as to damages awarded to the private complainant. The dispositive portion of the said decision states:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Agoo, La Union, in Criminal Case Nos. A-2758 and A-2759, finding accused-appellant Gregorio Carpio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of statutory rape and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in each case is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that accused-appellant is ordered to pay P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and another P50,000.00 as moral damages in each case.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellant maintains that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> gravely erred: (1) in giving weight and credence to the incredible and inconsistent testimonies of the prosecution witnesses; and (2) in convicting the accused-appellant of the crime charged despite the fact that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In the Appellant's Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> appellant reiterates his innocence of the crimes charged. He argues that in rape cases, the victim's testimony must be clear, convincing and free from material contradictions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Contrariwise, appellant maintains that private complainant's testimony lacks elements of truthfulness.<br><br>Particularly, appellant points out that AAA's "recollection of her ordeal in the hands of the accused-appellant and with her uncle Alfredo Dumo is very uniform and without difference in the way the alleged acts were committed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> He underscores the fact that the crimes were alleged in the Informations to have been committed sometime in the year 1991 and sometime in the month of June to the middle of August 1993, yet private complainant could not even remember the precise dates when the dastardly acts were committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Moreover, appellant asserts that while AAA readily revealed to her mother that appellant allegedly raped her, she was afraid to reveal her same experience with Alfredo Dumo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>It is apparent that appellant advocates that the actual violator of AAA was not himself, but Alfredo Dumo. He finds it significant to point out that his wife and Alfredo's wife are both called Glory. Appellant seeks to cast doubt on the credibility of the alleged eyewitness account of Julieta Flores because in her testimony, BBB confirmed that the exact words said to her by the former was that she "saw AAA and the husband of Glory behind the house."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> He likewise capitalizes on the failure of the prosecution to put Julieta Flores on the witness stand.<br><br>Any review of a rape case begins with the settled reality that accusing a person of this crime can be done with facility. Thus, the testimony of the complainant must always be scrutinized with great caution. It may not be easy for her to prove the commission of rape; yet it is even more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove his guilt. This principle must be viewed in relation to that which holds that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits; it cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>After a judicious and painstaking study of the arguments of the parties and of the records <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, we reach the inescapable conclusion that the prosecution has effectively established its case and as thus, appellant's contentions deserve scant consideration.<br><br>Findings of facts of trial courts carry great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless shown to be contrary to facts or circumstances of weight and substance in the record. For generally, the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by trial courts, because of their unique opportunity to observe the witnesses and their demeanor, conduct and attitude, especially under cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In this case, we find no cogent reason to depart from this settled rule. The evidence fully sustains the trial court's findings and conclusions.<br><br>AAA was all of nine (9) years old when her sufferings began. It is ludicrous to believe that a child of such tender years would concoct such grave accusations against her granduncle if the same were not true. Even more, it is preposterous to imagine that a child of her age would already have such intimate knowledge of the sexual acts she described in her testimony, with such clarity and coherence, unless the same were borne of personal experience.<br><br>During direct examination, AAA recounted the crime against her in particular detail, and with obvious distress testified that:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">x x x x</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When you were still in Grade 4[,] what did the accused Gregorio Carpio do to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He called for me to remove his earwax from his ear and after that he brought me to their house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

The  Honorable  Court  finds  nothing  extraordinary about it x x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Having reviewed the testimonies adduced by the prosecution and the recounting of events by the victim herself, the Court finds that indeed the crimes as charged have been committed against AAA. AAA withstood the difficulties of not only her direct examination, but the rigors of cross-examination by the defense as well. Although at times having broken down and cried, AAA nonetheless managed to give an unambiguous, categorical and forthright testimony. Her apparent vulnerability from the recent traumatic events in her life only serve to reinforce the strength and plausibility of her allegations.<br><br>We have no reason to believe that AAA was motivated by any other reason than to seek justice and vindication for the wrong done against her. As the Court of Appeals aptly pointed out, "the revelation of an eleven year-old child whose chastity was abused deserves full credit as her willingness to face police investigation and to undergo the trouble of humiliation of a public trial is eloquent testimony of the truthfulness of her complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the medical certificate and testimony of Dr. Bautista corroborate AAA's allegations of rape. Dr. Bautista found two old hymenal lacerations at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions in her examination of AAA. The rupture of AAA's hymen, she explained, was caused by the insertion of a hard object, possibly an erect human penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Appellant discredits the private complainant's testimony as replete with inconsistencies and he calls attention to AAA's failure to remember the dates on which she claimed to have been raped by appellant. To these, the Court has repeatedly held that it is natural for inconsistencies to creep into the testimony of a rape victim who is of tender age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>  Courts expect minor inconsistencies when a child-victim narrates the details of a harrowing experience like rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Inconsistencies in a rape victim's testimony do not impair her credibility, especially if the inconsistencies refer to trivial matters that do not alter the essential fact of the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It should be pointed out that victims of rape hardly retain in their memory the dates, number of times and manner they were violated, and it is for this reason that the exact date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> If nothing more, these minor inconsistencies in fact are badges of candidness and naturalness on the part of the witness.<br><br>The inconsistencies, if any, in AAA's testimony are minor details. They are too inconsequential and immaterial to affect the heart of the issue. These lapses do not detract from the overwhelming testimony of the prosecution witnesses who positively identified the malefactor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> What is material is that all the elements of statutory rape have been properly alleged and adequately proved in this case. In statutory rape, only two elements need to be established: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of the offended party; and (2) that the offended party was below twelve (12) years of age at the time of the sexual assault.  Force or intimidation, not being an essential element of the crime, need not be proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Appellant avers that AAA's recollection of her ordeal in his hands and with Alfredo Dumo was very uniform. Thus, he asserts that this engenders the suspicion that AAA's testimony was coached, rehearsed or contrived.<br><br>The Court finds no reason to reverse the assessment of the trial court that private complainant is a trustworthy witness and that the crimes as alleged have satisfactorily been proved. It must be stressed that the allegation that Alfredo Dumo raped private complainant is independent of the allegations against appellant. Indeed, while it appears that testimonies were introduced in trial to demonstrate Dumo's culpability for raping AAA, the claim that another person is also responsible for other dastardly acts does not negate the commission of rape by appellant when this has been demonstrated in vivid detail by private complainant herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The preparations made by BBB and counsel to file complaints for rape against Alfredo Dumo highlight the autonomy of the charge of rape against the separate culprits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Moreover, AAA's unequivocal recounting of her horrific experiences by both men vastly differ in circumstances. For example, appellant was alleged to have raped AAA in the daytime and in his home when his family was out. Furthermore, AAA could no longer count the multitude of times she was sexually abused by appellant. On the other hand, the alleged rapes by Dumo were purported to have been done at night, with relatives within the immediate surroundings of the scene of the crime, and after Dumo supposedly drank with CCC until the latter was intoxicated, in order to facilitate the rape. Dumo allegedly raped AAA on eight (8) weekends, both on Saturdays and on Sundays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Thus, appellant has miserably failed to demonstrate that AAA is confused by her circumstances. Conversely, AAA has in fact shown a clear-headed remembrance of her sufferings from each of her offenders.<br><br>It is of no moment that as appellant puts it, private complainant "readily revealed to her mother that the accused-appellant allegedly raped her, [yet] she was afraid to reveal her same experience with Alfredo Dumo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Contrary to his assertions, the records amply show that private complainant has had the tendency to carry the burden of her ordeals by herself. AAA was simply forced by circumstances to divulge her experiences when confronted by her mother, in the case of appellant, and when testifying in court, in the case of Alfredo Dumo.<br><br>In the same manner, the attempt to discredit the credibility of the eyewitness account as told to BBB by her <span style="font-style: italic;">kumadre</span> is without merit. Albeit BBB admits that appellant was only referred to as "the husband of Glory" and although both appellant's and Alfredo Dumo's wives are named Glory, the circumstances of time and place coupled with the unambiguous identification of appellant by AAA as the rapist for these cases at bar, can lead to no conclusion other than that it was appellant who committed the deplorable acts as charged. We note the prosecution's attempts to subpoena Julieta Flores to testify in trial, however for naught.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The court orders<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and subpoena return<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> demonstrate the earnest efforts made by the prosecution to present the testimony of the eyewitness. Ultimately, Julieta Flores's testimony would merely have been corroborative and not essential to establishing the fundamental elements of the instant cases.<br><br>Upon the other hand, appellant's alibi and denial of the crimes charged are inherently weak. It is in fact the defense of alibi that should be considered with suspicion and always received with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable, but also because it is easily fabricated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  For alibi to prosper, the appellant must not only prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed. He must also convincingly demonstrate the physical impossibility of his presence at the <span style="font-style: italic;">locus criminis</span> at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, appellant failed to show that it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime on the occasions of the rape. Not only were the alleged locations of his alibi all within the same province, there is no evidence that appellant never absented himself from work or the purported <span style="font-style: italic;">mahjong</span> sessions with his friends in the three years that the rapes were alleged to have been committed. It is likewise inconceivable that appellant's wife never once left him alone in their home, as it is absurd to believe his claim that he never spoke with AAA whenever she was at his house.<br><br>On the contrary, it was adequately established that appellant lived but a few meters from AAA's home. It is easy to see how the crimes could have been committed with facility. Moreover, being the husband of a grandaunt, he exercised moral ascendancy over the child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Not only that, as observed by the trial court, the appellant is a "bulky and hulking" man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> A nine-year old child would have been no match for his physical size.<br><br>Thus, we sustain the finding of guilt and the consequent penalty imposed as pronounced by the RTC and the Court of Appeals. Noteworthy is the fact that both Informations for statutory rape allege that the crimes were committed prior to both the passage of the law imposing death for rape cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> as well as the new rape law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code then provided:<br><blockquote>Article 335. When and how rape is committed. â”€ Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>1. By using force or intimidation;<br>2. When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br>3. When the woman us under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br>The crime of rape shall be punished by <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x x<br></div></blockquote>The minority of the private complainant was alleged in the Information and proven with certainty. There is thus no impediment in affirming the sentence of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> for each count of rape.<br><br>Anent the civil liability of appellant, we modify the award of damages in line with prevailing jurisprudence. Consequently, the court finds Carpio liable to AAA in the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The award of civil indemnity, which is in the nature of actual or compensatory damages, is mandatory upon a conviction of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> On the other hand, the award of moral damages is automatically granted in rape cases<br><br>without need of further proof other than the commission of the crime because  it  is  assumed  that  a rape victim has actually suffered moral injuries entitling her to such award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Finally, the presence of the qualifying circumstance of minority necessitates the award of exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the RTC in Criminal Case Nos.

Appellant GREGORIO CARPIO @ "GORIO" is sentenced, in each of the criminal cases subject of this review, to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span> and to pay the victim AAA (to be identified through the Informations in this case), the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages plus costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Carpio Morales,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><span style="font-style: italic;"> Rollo, </span>pp. 3-22.
