Proc. No. 99-00988-D in RTC Branch 43; that since the one-year period of redemption has already lapsed, the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of respondent becomes a ministerial duty of the trial court; that the issues in Civil Case No. 99-03169-D are not prejudicial questions to Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D because: (a) the special proceeding is already <span style="font-style: italic;">fait accompli, </span>(b) Civil Case No. 99-03169-D is deemed not filed for being contrary to Section 8 of Act No. 3135, (c) the filing of Civil Case No. 99-03169-D is an afterthought and dilatory in nature, and (d) legally speaking what seems to exist is <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia </span>and not prejudicial question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but it was denied by the CA on April 26, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Hence, the present Petition for Review on Certiorari.<br><br>Petitioners pose two issues for resolution, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>Whether or not a real estate mortgage over several properties located in different locality [sic] can be separately foreclosed in different places.<br><br></li><li>Whether or not the pendency of a prejudicial issue renders the issues in Special Proceedings No. 99-00988-D as [sic] moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Anent the first issue, petitioners contend that since a real estate mortgage is indivisible, the mortgaged properties in Dagupan City and Quezon City cannot be separately foreclosed. Petitioners further point out that two notices of extra-judicial sale indicated that petitioners' obligation is P10,437,015.20<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> each as of March 31, 1998 or a total of P20,874,030.40,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> yet their own computation yields only P9,957,508.90 as of February 27, 1998.<br><br>As to the second issue, petitioners posit that the pendency of Civil Case No. 99-03169-D is a prejudicial issue, the resolution of which will render the issues in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D moot and academic.&nbsp; Petitioners further aver that they did not violate Section 8 of Act No. 3135 in filing a separate case to annul the certificate of sale since the use of the word "may" in said provision indicates that they have the option to seek relief of filing a petition to annul the certificate of sale in the proceeding involving the application for a writ of possession or in a separate proceeding.<br><br>Respondent contends<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that, with respect to the first issue, the filing of two separate foreclosure proceedings did not violate Article 2089 of the Civil Code on the indivisibility of a real estate mortgage since Section 2 of Act No. 3135 expressly provides that extra-judicial foreclosure may only be made in the province or municipality where the property is situated.&nbsp; Respondent further submits that the filing of separate applications for extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage involving several properties in different locations is allowed by A.M. No. 99-10-05-0, the Procedure on Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, as further amended on August 7, 2001.<br><br>As to the second issue, respondent maintains that there is no prejudicial question between Civil Case No. 99-03169-D and Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D since the pendency of a civil action questioning the validity of the mortgage and the extra-judicial foreclosure thereof does not bar the issuance of a writ of possession.&nbsp; Respondent also insists that petitioners should have filed their Petition to Annul the Certificate of Sale in the same case where possession is being sought, that is, in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D, and not in a separate proceeding (Civil Case No. 99-01369-D) because the venue of the action to question the validity of the foreclosure is not discretionary since the use of the word "may" in Section 8 of Act No. 3135 refers to the filing of the petition or action itself and not to the venue. Respondent further argues that even if petitioners filed the Petition to Annul the Certificate of Sale in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D, the writ of possession must still be issued because issuance of the writ in favor of the purchaser is a ministerial act of the trial court and the one-year period of redemption has already lapsed.<br><br>Anent the first issue, the Court finds that petitioners have a mistaken notion that the indivisibility of a real estate mortgage relates to the venue of extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings.&nbsp; The rule on indivisibility of a real estate mortgage is provided for in Article 2089 of the Civil Code, which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 2089. A pledge or mortgage is indivisible, even though the debt may be divided among the successors in interest of the debtor or of the creditor.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>Therefore, the debtor's heir who has paid a part of the debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the debt is not completely satisfied.<br><br>Neither can the creditor's heir who received his share of the debt return the pledge or cancel the mortgage, to the prejudice of the other heirs who have not been paid.<br><br>From these provisions is excepted the case in which, there being several things given in mortgage or pledge, each one of them guarantees only a determinate portion of the credit.<br><br>The debtor, in this case, shall have a right to the extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the portion of the debt for which each thing is specially answerable is satisfied.<br></blockquote>This rule presupposes several heirs of the debtor or creditor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and therefore not applicable to the present case.&nbsp; Furthermore, what the law proscribes is the foreclosure of only a portion of the property or a number of the several properties mortgaged corresponding to the unpaid portion of the debt where, before foreclosure proceedings, partial payment was made by the debtor on his total outstanding loan or obligation.&nbsp; This also means that the debtor cannot ask for the release of any portion of the mortgaged property or of one or some of the several lots mortgaged unless and until the loan thus secured has been fully paid, notwithstanding the fact that there has been partial fulfillment of the obligation.&nbsp; Hence, it is provided that the debtor who has paid a part of the debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishment of the mortgage as long as the debt is not completely satisfied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]&nbsp;</sup> In essence, indivisibility means that the mortgage obligation cannot be divided among the different lots,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> that is, each and every parcel under mortgage answers for the totality of the debt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the venue of the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings is the place where each of the mortgaged property is located, as prescribed by Section 2 of Act No. 3135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2. Said sale cannot be made legally outside of the province in which the property sold is situated; and in case the place within said province in which the sale is to be made is subject to stipulation, such sale shall be made in said place or in the municipal building of the municipality in which the property or part thereof is situated.<br></blockquote>A.M. No. 99-10-05-0,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Procedure on Extra-Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, lays down the guidelines for extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings on mortgaged properties located in different provinces. It provides that the venue of the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings is the place where each of the mortgaged property is located.&nbsp; Relevant portion thereof provides:<br><blockquote>Where the application concerns the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages of real estates and/or chattels in different locations covering one indebtedness, only one filing fee corresponding to such indebtedness shall be collected.&nbsp; The collecting Clerk of Court shall, apart from the official receipt of the fees, issue a certificate of payment indicating the amount of indebtedness, the filing fees collected, the mortgages sought to be foreclosed, the real estates and/or chattels mortgaged and their respective locations, <span style="font-weight: bold;">which certificate shall serve the purpose of having the application docketed with the Clerks of Court of the places where the other properties are located and of allowing the extrajudicial foreclosures to proceed thereat.</span> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The indivisibility of the real estate mortgage is not violated by conducting two separate foreclosure proceedings on mortgaged properties located in different provinces as long as each parcel of land is answerable for the entire debt. Petitioners' assumption that their total obligation is P20,874,030.40 because the two notices of extra-judicial sale indicated that petitioners' obligation is P10,437,015.20<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> each, is therefore flawed.&nbsp; Considering the indivisibility of a real estate mortgage, the mortgaged properties in Dagupan City and Quezon City are made to answer for the entire debt of P10,437,015.29.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>As to the second issue, that is, whether a civil case for annulment of a certificate of sale is a prejudicial question to a petition for issuance of a writ of possession, this issue is far from novel and, in fact, not without precedence.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Pahang v. Vestil,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court said:<br><blockquote>A prejudicial question is one that arises in a case the resolution of which is a logical antecedent of the issue involved therein, and the cognizance of which pertains to another tribunal.&nbsp; It generally comes into play in a situation where a civil action and a criminal action are both pending and there exists in the former an issue that must be preemptively resolved before the criminal action may proceed, because howsoever the issue raised in the civil action is resolved would be determinative <span style="font-style: italic;">juris et de jure</span> of the guilt or innocence of the accused in the criminal case.&nbsp; The rationale behind the principle of prejudicial question is to avoid two conflicting decisions.<br><br>In the present case, the complaint of the petitioners for Annulment of Extrajudicial Sale is a civil action and the respondent's petition for the issuance of a writ of possession of Lot No. 3-A, Block 1, Psd-07-021410, TCT No. 44668 is but an incident in the land registration case and, therefore, no prejudicial question can arise from the existence of the two actions. A similar issue was raised in <span style="font-style: italic;">Manalo v. Court of Appeals,</span> where we held that:<br><blockquote>At any rate, it taxes our imagination why the questions raised in Case No. 98-0868 must be considered determinative of Case No. 9011.&nbsp; The basic issue in the former is whether the respondent, as the purchaser in the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, may be compelled to have the property repurchased or resold to a mortgagor's successor-in-interest (petitioner); while that in the latter is merely whether the respondent, as the purchaser in the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, is entitled to a writ of possession after the statutory period for redemption has expired.&nbsp; The two cases, assuming both are pending, can proceed separately and take their own direction independent of each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>In the present case, Civil Case No. 99-01369-D and Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D are both civil in nature.&nbsp; The issue in Civil Case No. 99-01369-D is whether the extra-judicial foreclosure of the real estate mortgage executed by the petitioners in favor of the respondent and the sale of their properties at public auction are null and void, whereas, the issue in Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D is whether the respondent is entitled to a writ of possession of the foreclosed properties. Clearly, no prejudicial question can arise from the existence of the two actions. The two cases can proceed separately and take their own direction independently of each other.<br><br>Nevertheless, there is a need to correct the CA's view that petitioners violated Section 8 of Act No. 3135 and disregarded the proscription on multiplicity of suits by instituting a separate civil suit for annulment of the certificate of sale while there is a pending petition for issuance of the writ of possession in a special proceeding.<br><br>Section 8 of Act No. 3135 provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 8. <span style="font-style: italic;">Setting aside of sale and writ of possession</span>. — The debtor <span style="font-weight: bold;">may, in the proceedings in which possession was requested, but not later than thirty days after the purchaser was given possession, petition that the sale be set aside and the writ of possession cancelled,</span> specifying the damages suffered by him, because the mortgage was not violated or the sale was not made in accordance with the provisions hereof, and the court shall take cognizance of this petition in accordance with the summary procedure provided for in section one hundred and twelve of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six; and if it finds the complaint of the debtor justified, it shall dispose in his favor of all or part of the bond furnished by the person who obtained possession.&nbsp; Either of the parties may appeal from the order of the judge in accordance with section fourteen of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six; but the order of possession shall continue in effect during the pendency of the appeal. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Under the provision above cited, the mortgagor may file a petition to set aside the sale and for the cancellation of a writ of possession with the trial court which issued the writ of possession within 30 days after the purchaser mortgagee was given possession. It provides the plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in opposing the issuance of a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, this provision presupposes that the trial court already issued a writ of possession.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Sps. Ong v. Court of Appeals</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court elucidated:<br><blockquote>The law is clear that the purchaser must first be placed in possession of the mortgaged property pending proceedings assailing the issuance of the writ of possession. If the trial court later finds merit in the petition to set aside the writ of possession, it shall dispose in favor of the mortgagor the bond furnished by the purchaser. Thereafter, either party may appeal from the order of the judge in accordance with Section 14 of Act 496, which provides that "every order, decision, and decree of the Court of Land Registration may be reviewed...in the same manner as an order, decision, decree or judgment of a Court of First Instance (RTC) might be reviewed." The rationale for the mandate is to allow the purchaser to have possession of the foreclosed property without delay, such possession being founded on his right of ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>Accordingly, Section 8 of Act No. 3135 is not applicable to the present case since at the time of the filing of the separate civil suit for annulment of the certificate of sale in RTC Branch 44, no writ of possession was yet issued by RTC Branch 43.<br><br>Similarly, the Court rejects the CA's application of the principle of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> to Civil Case No. 99-03169-D in relation to Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D. <span style="font-style: italic;">Litis pendentia</span> refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of actions and that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious.&nbsp; For <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> to be invoked, the concurrence of the following requisites is necessary: (a) identity of parties or at least such as represent the same interest in both actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the reliefs being founded on the same facts; and, (c) the identity in the two cases should be such that the judgment that may be rendered in one would, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Applying the foregoing criteria in the instant case, <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> does not obtain in this case because of the absence of the second and third requisites. The issuance of the writ of possession being a<span style="font-style: italic;"> ministerial </span>function, and <span style="font-style: italic;">summary </span>in nature, it cannot be said to be a judgment on the merits, but simply an incident in the transfer of title. Hence, a separate case for annulment of mortgage and foreclosure sale cannot be barred by <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, insofar as Spec. Proc. No. 99-00988-D and Civil Case No. 99-03169-D pending before different branches of RTC Dagupan City are concerned, there is no<span style="font-style: italic;"> litis pendentia.</span><br><br>To sum up, the Court holds that the rule on indivisibility of the real estate mortgage cannot be equated with the venue of foreclosure proceedings on mortgaged properties located in different provinces since these are two unrelated concepts. Also, no prejudicial question can arise from the existence of a civil case for annulment of a certificate of sale and a petition for the issuance of a writ of possession in a special proceeding since the two cases are both civil in nature which can proceed separately and take their own direction independently of each other.<br><br>Furthermore, since the one-year period to redeem the foreclosed properties lapsed on October 1, 1999, title to the foreclosed properties had already been consolidated under the name of the respondent.&nbsp; As the owner of the properties, respondent is entitled to its possession as a matter of right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; The issuance of a writ of possession over the properties by the trial court is merely a ministerial function. As such, the trial court neither exercises its official discretion nor judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Any question regarding the validity of the mortgage or its foreclosure cannot be a legal ground for refusing the issuance of a writ of possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Regardless of the pending suit for annulment of the certificate of sale, respondent is entitled to a writ of possession, without prejudice of course to the eventual outcome of said case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED.</span><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Panganiban, C.J., (Chairperson), Ynares-Santiago, Callejo, Sr.,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chico-Nazario, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Andres B.
