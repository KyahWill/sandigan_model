				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, petitioner imputes grave abuse of discretion to the Court of Appeals vis-a-vis its May 30, 2001 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in CA-G.R. CV No. 67017, the dispositive portion of which read:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the present appeal is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span> for lack of merit. The Decision (Judgment) dated October 29, 1999 of the Regional Trial Court of Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, Branch 10 in Civil Case No. 2586-95 is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">REITERATED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>The facts follow.<br><br>Petitioner Agapita Diaz operated a common carrier, a Tamaraw FX taxi plying the route of Cagayan de Oro City to any point in Region 10. On July 20, 1996, petitioner's taxi, driven by one Arman Retes, was moving at an excessive speed when it rammed into the rear portion of a Hino cargo truck owned by private respondent Teodoro Lantoria and driven by private respondent Rogelio Francisco. As a result, nine passengers of the taxi died including Sherly Moneño.<br><br>On August 13, 1996, the heirs of Sherly Moneño<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> filed with the Regional Trial Court of Malaybalay City, Branch 10,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> an action for breach of contract of carriage and damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> against petitioner and her driver, Arman Retes.<br><br>On motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> petitioner filed a third-party complaint against private respondents Teodorio Lantoria and Rogelio Francisco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The pre-trial conference was initially set on July 11, 1998 but was reset to July 30, 1998 for petitioner and her counsel's failure to appear<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> despite due notice. Registry receipt number 04364<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> showed that notice had been sent to petitioner's counsel, Atty. Cipriano Lupeba.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On scheduled date, petitioner and her counsel again failed to appear, prompting the court to allow private respondents to present evidence<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex parte.</span><br><br>More than seven months after the conclusion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of private respondents' <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> presentation of evidence, petitioner filed a motion for leave to present evidence on her defense and third-party complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The trial court denied this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On October 29, 1999, the trial court rendered a decision holding petitioner and Arman Retes jointly and severally liable to pay private respondent heirs of Sherly Moneño P50,000 for her death, P50,000 as moral damages, P20,000 as exemplary damages and P20,000 as attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the trial court's decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in the assailed May 30, 2001 decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The motion for reconsideration was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Hence, this recourse.<br><blockquote>The issues raised by petitioner are:<br><br>1) whether or not the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the trial court's decision denying petitioner's motion for leave to present evidence on her defense and third-party complaint, and<br><br>2) whether or not the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the trial court's decision holding petitioner liable for breach of contract.<br><br>The petition lacks merit.<br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>, Section 3, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court states that:<br><blockquote>The notice of pre-trial shall be served on counsel, or on the party who has no counsel. The counsel served with such notice is charged with the duty of notifying the party represented by him.<br></blockquote>Petitioner was represented by Atty. Cipriano Lupeba to whom the notice was sent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It was incumbent on the latter to advise petitioner accordingly. His failure to do so constituted negligence which bound petitioner.<br><br>Further, Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 18 read:<br><blockquote>Sec. 4. Appearance of Parties. - It shall be the duty of the parties and their counsel to appear at the pre-trial. The non-appearance of the party may be excused only if a valid cause is shown therefore or if a representative shall appear in his behalf fully authorized in writing to enter into an amicable settlement, to submit to alternative modes of dispute resolution, and to enter into stipulations or admissions of facts and of documents.<br><br>Sec. 5. Effect of failure to appear. - The failure of the plaintiff to appear when so required pursuant to the next preceding section shall be cause for the dismissal of the action. The dismissal shall be with prejudice, unless otherwise ordered by the court. A similar failure on the defendant shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to present his evidence<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex parte</span> and the court to render judgment on the basis thereof.<br></blockquote>Consequently, it was no error for the trial court  to allow private respondents to present their evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex parte</span> when petitioner and her counsel failed to appear for the scheduled pre-trial conference.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, "a common carrier is bound to carry the passengers safely as far as human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In a contract of carriage, it is presumed that the common carrier is at fault or is negligent when a passenger dies or is injured. In fact, there is even no need for the court to make an express finding of fault or negligence on the part of the common carrier. This statutory presumption may only be overcome by evidence that the carrier exercised extraordinary diligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner, as common carrier, failed to establish sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of negligence. The findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, showed that the accident which led to the death of Sherly Moneño was caused by the reckless speed and gross negligence of petitioner's driver who demonstrated no regard for the safety of his passengers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  It was thus correct to hold petitioner guilty of breach of the contract of carriage.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, this petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Puno, (Chairperson), Sandoval-Gutierrez, Azcuna</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In some pleadings, Moneño was spelled as "Moñeno" or "Moneno."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Martin S.
