Llave of rape.<br><br>On September 27, 2002, an Information charging petitioner (then only 12 years old) with rape was filed with the RTC of Pasay City. The inculpatory portion of the Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 24th day of September 2002, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, NEIL LLAVE Y FLORES, aka NIEL F. LLAVE, a minor over nine (9) years of age and under fifteen (15) but acting with discernment, by means of force threat and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant, DEBBIELYN SANTOS y QUITALES, a minor, seven (7) years of age, against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Case for the Prosecution</span><br></div><br>The spouses Domingo and Marilou Santos were residents of Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  One of their children, Debbielyn, was born on December 8, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  In 2002, she was a Grade II student at the Villamor Air Base Elementary School in Pasay City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and attended classes from 12:00 noon to 6:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Domingo eked out a living as a jeepney driver, while Marilou sold quail eggs at a nearby church.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Adjacent to their house was that of Teofisto Bucud, a barbecue vendor who would usually start selling at 6:30 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Next to Teofisto's residence was a vacant house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Debbielyn testified that on September 24, 2002, she arrived home at past 6:00 p.m. She changed her clothes and proceeded to her mother's store.

According to Marilyn, her son had raped the private complainant. She went to their house to look for her son and came across Domingo Santos who threatened to kill her son. She and her husband proceeded to the house of his sister Josefina at Cadena de Amor Street where petitioner had hidden for a while.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>At the conclusion of the trial, the court rendered judgment convicting Neil of the crime charged. The decretal portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>FROM ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court opines that the prosecution has proven the guilt of the xxx Niel Llave y Flores beyond reasonable doubt when he forcibly pulled the complainant towards the vacant lot, laid on top of her and had carnal knowledge with the [complainant] against her will and consent who is only seven (7) years old (sic). Moreover, he being a minor, he cannot be meted with the Death penalty.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the CICL [Child in Conflict with the Law] Niel Llave y Flores guilty beyond reasonable doubt, and crediting him with the special mitigating circumstance of minority, this Court hereby sentences him to<span style="font-style: italic;"> prision mayor </span>minimum, Six (6) years and One (1) day to Eight (8) years, and pay civil indemnity of Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php50,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court declared that based on the evidence of the prosecution that petitioner pushed the victim towards the vacant house and sexually abused her, petitioner acted with discernment. It also considered petitioner's declaration that he had been a consistent honor student.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Petitioner appealed the decision to the CA, where he averred the following in his Brief as appellant therein:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT DISREGARDED THE MATERIAL INCONSISTENCIES OF THE TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINING WITNESS WITH THAT OF THE MEDICAL REPORT ON THE FACTUAL ALLEGATION OF BLEEDING.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT GAVE CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESS TEOFISTO BUCUD WHO HAS REASON TO FABRICATE A SCENARIO AGAINST ACCUSED-APPELLANT BECAUSE HE HAS PERSONAL VENDETTA AGAINST THE LATTER'S FAMILY/RELATIVES.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN UPHOLDING THE THEORY OF THE PROSECUTION OF RAPE BY HAVING CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, BEING CONTRARY TO THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA rendered judgment affirming the decision with modification as to the penalty meted on him.<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision subject of the instant appeal is hereby MODIFIED in that the accused-appellant is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of two (2) years and four (4) months of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correccional </span>medium as the minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision mayor</span> medium as the maximum. Additionally, the accused-appellant is ordered to pay the complaining witness the amount of P50,000 by way of moral damages and P20,000 by way of exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for the Reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>contending that the prosecution failed to adduce proof that he acted with discernment; hence, he should be acquitted. The appellate court denied the motion in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> dated November 12, 2004 on the following finding:<br><blockquote>As regards the issue of whether the accused-appellant acted with discernment, his conduct during and after the "crime" betrays the theory that as a minor, the accused-appellant does not have the mental faculty to grasp the propriety and consequences of the act he made. As correctly pointed out by the prosecution, the fact that forthrightly upon discovery, the accused-appellant fled the scene and hid in his grandmother's house intimates that he knew that he did something that merits punishment.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>Contrary to the urgings of the defense, the fact that the accused-appellant is a recipient of several academic awards and is an honor student further reinforces the finding that he [is] possessed [of] intelligence well beyond his years and is thus poised to distinguish, better at least than other minors his age could, which conduct is right and which is morally reprehensible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner now raises the following issues and arguments in the instant petition before this Court:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ISSUES</span><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div>WHETHER OR NOT EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT PETITIONER BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div>WHETHER OR NOT PETITIONER, WHO WAS A MINOR ABOVE 9 YEARS BUT BELOW 15 YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME, ACTED WITH DISCERNMENT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div>WHETHER OR NOT PETITIONER WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ARGUMENTS</span><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE MATERIAL INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINING WITNESS WITH THE MEDICAL REPORT BELIE THE FINDING OF RAPE.<br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>PRIVATE COMPLAINANT IS NOT A CREDIBLE WITNESS.<br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>PETITIONER ACTED WITHOUT DISCERNMENT.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div>THE TESTIMONY RELIED UPON BY THE PROSECUTION IS HEARSAY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V<br></div>THE COMPLAINT IS FABRICATED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">VI<br></div>PETITIONER WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>The issues raised by the petitioner in this case may be summarized as follows: (1) whether he was deprived of his right to a preliminary investigation; (2) whether he had carnal knowledge of the private complainant, and if in the affirmative, whether he acted with discernment in perpetrating the crime; (3) whether the penalty imposed by the appellate court is correct; and (4) whether he is liable to pay moral damages to the private complainant.<br><br>On the first issue, petitioner avers that he was deprived of his right to a preliminary investigation before the Information against him was filed.<br><br>On the second issue, petitioner claims that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had carnal knowledge of Debbielyn. He insists that her testimony is inconsistent on material points. He points out that she claimed to have felt pain in her vagina when petitioner inserted his penis to the point that she cried; this, however, is negated by Dr. Castillo's report stating that there was no evidence of injury on the victim's external genitalia. Petitioner maintains that as against the victim's testimony and that of Dr. Castillo's report, the latter should prevail.<br><br>According to petitioner, mere touching of the female organ will not suffice as factual basis of conviction for consummated rape. Moreover, the victim's testimony lacks credibility in view of her admission that, while she was being allegedly ravished by him, there were passersby along the street. Besides, petitioner avers, an abrasion may be caused by an invasion of the body through the protective covering of the skin.  Petitioner insists that the prosecution failed to prove the cause of the abrasion.<br><br>Petitioner also claims that the victim was tutored or coached by her parents on her testimony before the trial court. Dr. Castillo testified that when she interviewed Debbielyn, the latter admitted to her that she did not understand the meaning of the word "rape" and its Filipino translation, <span style="font-style: italic;">"hinalay</span>," and that the genital examination of the girl was at the insistence of the latter's parents.<br><br>Petitioner avers that Teofisto Bucud's testimony has no probative weight because and had an ill-motive to testify against him. Petitioner stated, on cross-examination, that his uncle, Boy, had the house rented by Teofisto demolished.  Petitioner avers that the witness persuaded the victim's parents to complain against him, as gleaned from the testimony of Police Investigator Milagros Carroso.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>For its part, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) avers that petitioner was subjected to an inquest investigation under Section 7, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, as gleaned from the Certification of the City Prosecutor incorporated in the Information. It avers that the absence of external injuries does not negate rape; neither is it necessary that lacerations be found on the hymen of a victim.  Rape is consummated if there is some degree of penetration within the vaginal surface.  Corroborative evidence is not necessary to prove rape. As long as the testimony of the victim is credible, such testimony will suffice for conviction of consummated rape.  When the victim testified that she was raped, she was, in effect, saying all that is necessary to prove that rape was consummated.  Petitioner's evidence to prove ill-motive on the part of Teofisto Bucud in testifying against him is at best flimsy. Moreover, it is incredible that the victim and her parents would charge petitioner with rape solely on Teofisto's proddings.<br><br>The OSG insists that the petitioner acted with discernment before, during, and after the rape based on the undisputed facts. The submission of the OSG follows:<br><blockquote>Petitioner argues that since he was only 12 years old at the time of the alleged rape incident, he is presumed to have acted without discernment under paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code. Under said provision, the prosecution has the burden of proving that he acted with discernment. In the instant case, petitioner insists that there was no evidence presented by the prosecution to show that he acted with discernment. Hence, he should be exempt from criminal liability.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>Petitioner's arguments are bereft of merit.<br><br>Discernment, as used in Article 12(3) of the Revised Penal Code is defined as follows: "the discernment that constitutes an exception to the exemption from criminal liability of a minor under fifteen (15) years of age but over nine (9), who commits an act prohibited by law, is his mental capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong" (<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Doquena,</span> 68 Phil. 580 [1939]). For a minor above nine but below fifteen years of age, he must discern the rightness or wrongness of the effects of his act (<span style="font-style: italic;">Guevarra v. Almodova,</span> G.R. No. 75256, January 26, 1989).<br><br>Professor Ambrocio Padilla, in his annotation of Criminal Law (p. 375, 1998 Ed.), writes that "discernment is more than the mere understanding between right and wrong. Rather, it  means the mental capacity of a minor between 9 and 15 years of age to fully appreciate the consequences of his unlawful act" <span style="font-style: italic;">(People v. Navarro,</span> [CA] [51 O.G. 4062]). Hence, in judging whether a minor accused acted with discernment, his mental capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong, which may be known and should be determined by considering all the circumstances disclosed by the record of the case, his appearance, his attitude and his behavior and conduct, not only before and during the commission of the act, but also after and even during the trial should be taken into consideration (<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Doquena</span>, supra).<br><br>In the instant case, petitioner's actuations during and after the rape incident, as well as his behavior during the trial showed that he acted with discernment.<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br></div>The fact appears undisputed that immediately after being discovered by the prosecution's witness, Teofisto Bucud, petitioner immediately stood up and ran away. Shortly thereafter, when his parents became aware of the charges against him and that private complainant's father was looking for him, petitioner went into hiding. It was not until the Barangay Tanod came to arrest him in his grandmother's house that petitioner came out in the open to face the charges against him. His flight as well as his act of going into hiding clearly conveys the idea that he was fully aware of the moral depravity of his act and that he knew he committed something wrong. Otherwise, if he was indeed innocent or if he was not least aware of the moral consequences of his acts, he would have immediately confronted private complainant and her parents and denied having sexually abused their daughter.<br><br>During the trial, petitioner submitted documentary evidence to show that he was a consistent honor student and has, in fact, garnered several academic awards. This allegation further bolstered that he acted with discernment, with full knowledge and intelligence. The fact that petitioner was a recipient of several academic awards and was an honor student further reinforces the finding that he was possessed of intelligence well beyond his years and thus was able to distinguish, better than other minors of his age could, which conduct is right and which is morally reprehensible.  Hence, although appellant was still a minor of twelve years of age, he possessed intelligence far beyond his age.  It cannot then be denied that he had the mental capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong. This is important in cases where the accused is minor. It is worthy to note that the basic reason behind the enactment of the exempting circumstances under Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code is the complete absence of intelligence, freedom of action, or intent on the part of the accused. In expounding on intelligence as the second element of dolus, the Supreme Court has stated: "The second element of dolus is intelligence; without this power, necessary to determine the morality of human acts to distinguish a licit from an illicit act, no crime can exist, and because" the infant has no intelligence, the law exempts (him) from criminal liability" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Guevarra v. Aldomovar,</span> 169 SCRA 476 [1989], at page 482).<br><br>The foregoing circumstances, from the time the incident up to the time the petitioner was being held for trial, sufficiently satisfied the trial court that petitioner acted with discernment before, during and after the rape incident.  For a boy wanting in discernment would simply be gripped with fear or keep mum. In this case, petitioner was fully aware of the nature and illegality of his wrongful act. He should not, therefore, be exempted from criminal liability.  The prosecution has sufficiently proved that petitioner acted with discernment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>In reply, petitioner asserts that the only abrasion found by Dr. Castillo was on the peri-anal skin and not in the labia of the hymen. He further insists that there can be no consummated rape absent a slight penetration on the female organ.  It was incumbent on the prosecution to prove that the accused acted with discernment but failed. The mere fact that he was an honor student is not enough evidence to prove that he acted with discernment.<br><br>The petition is not meritorious.<br><br>On the first issue, petitioner's contention that he was deprived of his right to a regular preliminary investigation is barren of factual and legal basis. The record shows that petitioner was lawfully arrested without a warrant. Section 7, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">When accused lawfully arrested without warrant.</span> - When a person is lawfully arrested without a warrant involving an offense which requires a preliminary investigation, the complaint or information may be filed by a prosecutor without need of such investigation provided an inquest has been conducted in accordance with existing rules. In the absence or unavailability of an inquest prosecutor, the complaint may be filed by the offended party or a peace officer directly with the proper court on the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting officer or person.<br><br>Before the complaint or information is filed, the person arrested may ask for a preliminary investigation in accordance with this Rule, but he must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in the presence of his counsel. Notwithstanding the waiver, he may apply for bail and the investigation must be terminated within fifteen (15) days from its inception.<br><br>After the filing of the complaint or information in court without a preliminary investigation, the accused may, within five (5) days from the time he learns of its filing, ask for a preliminary investigation with the same right to adduce evidence in his defense as provided for in this Rule.<br></blockquote>As gleaned from the Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> of the City Prosecutor which was incorporated in the Information, petitioner did not execute any waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code before the Information was filed. He was arraigned with the assistance of counsel on October 10, 2002, and thereafter filed a petition for bail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>  Petitioner's failure to file a motion for a preliminary investigation within five days from finding out that an Information had been filed against him effectively operates as a waiver of his right to such preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>On the second issue, a careful review of the records shows that the prosecution adduced evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner had carnal knowledge of the private complainant as charged in the Information.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Morata</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court ruled that penetration, no matter how slight, or the mere introduction of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum, constitutes carnal knowledge.  Hence, even if the penetration is only slight, the fact that the private complainant felt pains, points to the conclusion that the rape was consummated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>From the victim's testimony, it can be logically concluded that petitioner's penis touched the middle part of her vagina and penetrated the labia of the pudendum. She may not have had knowledge of the extent of the penetration; however, her straightforward testimony shows that the rape passed the stage of consummation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> She testified that petitioner dragged her behind a pile of hollow blocks near the vacant house and ordered her to lie down.  He then removed her shorts and panty and spread her legs. He then mounted her and inserted his penis into her vagina:<br><blockquote>Fiscal Barrera:<br><br>Q: From what time up to what time?<br>A: From 12:00 o'clock noon up to 6:00 p.m.<br><br>Q: September 24, 2002 and going over the calendar, it was Tuesday.

She reiterated that the penis of petitioner penetrated her vagina, thus, consummating the crime charged:<br><blockquote>Atty. Baliad:<br><br>Q: Do you recall having stated during the last hearing that the accused, Neil Llave or "Totoy" inserted his penis in your vagina, do you recall that?<br>A: Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q: And likewise, you testified that you feel that the penis of Neil entered your vagina?<br>A: Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q: Could you distinguish vagina from your anus?<br>A: Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q: Where is your "pepe?"<br>A: (Witness pointing to her vagina.)<br><br>Q: Where is your anus?<br>A: (Witness pointing at her back, at the anus.)<br><br>Q: In your statement, am I correct to say that Neil, the accused in this case penetrated only in your vagina and not in your anus?<br>A: Yes, Sir.<br><br>Q: So that, your anus was not even touched by the accused neither by his penis touched any part of your anus?<br>A:  He did not insert anything on my anus, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>While it is true that Dr. Castillo did not find any abrasion or laceration in the private complainant's genitalia, such fact does not negate the latter's testimony the petitioner had carnal knowledge of her. The absence of abrasions and lacerations does not disprove sexual abuses, especially when the victim is a young girl as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> According to Dr. Castillo, the hymen is elastic and is capable of stretching and reverting to its original form. <sup><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72] </span></sup>The doctor testified that her report is compatible with the victim's testimony that she was sexually assaulted by petitioner:<br><blockquote>Atty.

It bears stressing that the private complainant testified in a straightforward and spontaneous manner and remained steadfast despite rigorous and intensive cross-examination by the indefatigable counsel of the petitioner.  She spontaneously pointed to and identified the petitioner as the perpetrator.<br><br>It is inconceivable that the private complainant, then only a seven- year old Grade II pupil, could have woven an intricate story of defloration unless her plaint was true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>  The Presiding Judge of the trial court observed and monitored the private complainant at close range as she testified and found her testimony credible. Case law is that the calibration by the trial court of the evidence on record and its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, as well as its findings of facts and the conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded conclusive effect by this Court unless facts and circumstances of substance were overlooked, misconstrued or misinterpreted, which, if considered would merit a nullification or reversal of the decision. We have held that when the offended party is young and immature, from the age of thirteen to sixteen, courts are inclined to give credence to their account of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed if the matter to which they testified is not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Neither do we lend credence to petitioner's claim that the charge against him is but a fabrication and concoction of the private complainant's parents. Indeed, petitioner admitted in no uncertain terms that the spouses had no ill-motive against him.  Thus, Neil testified as follows:<br><blockquote>Fiscal Barrera:<br><br>Q: As you testified earlier that you have played post cards with Debbielyn Santos alias Lyn-lyn and you have no quarrel or misunderstanding with Lyn-lyn. Do you know of any reason why Lyn-lyn complaint (sic) against you for sexual abuse?<br>A: I don't know of any reason, Sir.<br><br>Q: You also testified that you do not have any quarrel or misunderstanding with Lyn-lyn's parents, spouses Domingo Santos, Jr. and Marilou Santos, do you think of any reason as to why they would file a complaint against you for molesting their 7-year-old daughter?<br>A: I do not know of any reason why they filed a complaint against me, Sir.<br><br>Fiscal Barrera:<br>That would be all, Your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br></blockquote>There is no evidence that the parents of the offended party coached their daughter before she testified.  No mother or father would stoop so low as to subject their daughter to the tribulations and the embarrassment of a public trial knowing that such a traumatic experience would damage their daughter's psyche and mar her life if the charge is not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, when the parents learned that their daughter had been assaulted by petitioner, Domingo tried to locate the offender and when he failed, he and his wife reported the matter to the <span style="font-style: italic;">barangay </span>authorities. This manifested their ardent desire to have petitioner indicted and punished for his delictual acts.<br><br>That petitioner ravished the victim not far from the street where residents passed by does not negate the act of rape committed by petitioner.  Rape is not a respecter of time and place.  The crime may be committed by the roadside and even in occupied premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The presence of people nearby does not deter rapists from committing the odious act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>  In this case, petitioner was so daring that he ravished the private complainant near the house of Teofisto even as commuters passed by, impervious to the fact that a crime was being committed in their midst.<br><br>Case law has it that in view of the intrinsic nature of rape, the only evidence that can be offered to prove the guilt of the offender is the testimony of the offended party. Even absent a medical certificate, her testimony, standing alone, can be made the basis of conviction if such testimony is credible.  Corroborative testimony is not essential to warrant a conviction of the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>   Thus, even without the testimony of Teofisto Bucud, the testimonies of the offended party and Dr. Castillo constitute evidence beyond reasonable doubt warranting the conviction of petitioner.<br><br>Teofisto's testimony cannot be discredited by petitioner simply because his uncle caused the demolition of the house where Teofisto and his family were residing.  It bears stressing that Teofisto gave a sworn statement to the police investigator on the very day that the petitioner raped Debbielyn and narrated how he witnessed the crime being committed by the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup>  In the absence of proof of improper motive, the presumption is that Teofisto had no ill-motive to so testify, hence, his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly ruled that the petitioner acted with discernment when he had carnal knowledge of the offended party; hence, the CA cannot be faulted for affirming the trial court's ruling.<br><br>Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code provides that a person over nine years of age and under fifteen is exempt from criminal liability, unless he acted with discernment. The basic reason behind the exempting circumstance is complete absence of intelligence, freedom of action of the offender which is an essential element of a felony either by <span style="font-style: italic;">dolus</span> or by <span style="font-style: italic;">culpa</span>. Intelligence is the power necessary to determine the morality of human acts to distinguish a licit from an illicit act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>  On the other hand, discernment is the mental capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong. The prosecution is burdened to prove that the accused acted with discernment by evidence of physical appearance, attitude or deportment not only before and during the commission of the act, but also after and during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The surrounding circumstances must demonstrate that the minor knew what he was doing and that it was wrong. Such circumstance includes the gruesome nature of the crime and the minor's cunning and shrewdness.<br><br>In the present case, the petitioner, with methodical fashion, dragged the resisting victim behind the pile of hollow blocks near the vacant house to insure that passersby would not be able to discover his dastardly acts.  When he was discovered by Teofisto Bucud who shouted at him, the petitioner hastily fled from the scene to escape arrest.  Upon the prodding of his father and her mother, he hid in his grandmother's house to avoid being arrested by policemen and remained thereat until barangay tanods arrived and took him into custody.<br><br>The petitioner also testified that he had been an outstanding grade school student and even received awards.  While in Grade I, he was the best in his class in his academic subjects.  He represented his class in a quiz bee contest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>  At his the age of 12, he finished a computer course.<br><br>In<span style="font-style: italic;"> People v. Doqueña</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the Court held that the accused-appellant therein acted with discernment in raping the victim under the following facts:<br><blockquote>Taking into account the fact that when the accused Valentin Doqueña committed the crime in question, he was a 7<sup>th</sup> grade pupil in the intermediate school of the municipality of Sual, Pangasinan, and as such pupil, he was one of the brightest in said school and was a captain of a company of the cadet corps thereof, and during the time he was studying therein he always obtain excellent marks, this court is convinced that the accused, in committing the crime, acted with discernment and was conscious of the nature and consequences of his act, and so also has this court observed at the time said accused was testifying in his behalf during the trial of this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA ordered petitioner to pay P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.  There is no factual basis for the award of exemplary damages. Under Article 2231, of the New Civil Code, exemplary damages may be awarded if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances. In this case, no aggravating circumstance was alleged in the Information and proved by the People; hence, the award must be deleted.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</span> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span> for lack of merit.
