				<BR><BR><div align="justify">On review is the May 13, 2005 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 00652 affirming <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> that<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Sta. Cruz, Laguna, Branch 28 in Criminal Case No. SC-6841 which found appellant Emeterio Ricamora guilty of rape.<br><br>The information against appellant reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about January 21, 1998, in the municipality of Luisianan, province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused with lewd design and by means of force and intimidation, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with MARY ROSE N. ROCREO, against her will and consent, to her damage and prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>From the evidence for the prosecution consisting of the testimonies of the private complainant Mary Rose Rocreo, her sister Myra Rocreo, the Municipal Health Officer Dr. Martinita Leobrera, and SPO2 Bart Jamito, the following version is gathered:<br><br>The private complainant is the eldest of four children who were all living with their mother, Patria Nano (Patria), in Bala St., Luisiana, Laguna.<br><br>Sometime in 1993, appellant started cohabiting with the private complainant's mother Patria until February 1995, when she left for Singapore to work as a domestic helper.  Before she left, Patria entrusted the care of her children to appellant whom they considered as their stepfather.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <br><br>One night in October 1996, when the private complainant's siblings were out of the house, appellant called her to the kitchen, ordering her to do some chores.  As the private complainant entered the kitchen, appellant seized her, turned off the light, and forced her to lie down on the floor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>   Appellant started undressing her, telling her not to shout or else he would kill her and her siblings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Out of fear, the private complainant endured the  sexual advances of appellant who succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>Appellant thereafter repeatedly abused the private complainant at nighttime while her younger siblings were sleeping in the same room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]  </sup>Fearing that appellant would make good his threat to kill her and her siblings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the private complainant suffered in silence.<br><br>In the evening of January 21, 1998, as the private complainant and her younger sister Myra alighted from a passenger jeep on reaching their residence, appellant slapped them both and cursed them no end.  As the sisters entered their house, appellant took hold of a bolo and swung it hard at Myra who was able to avoid the blow as she ran away and did not return home that night.  On that same night, appellant again had sexual intercourse<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> with the private complainant.<br><br>The following day, January 22, 1998, the private complainant, together with her godmother Isabel Merginio and a barangay kagawad, repaired to the police station to file a complaint against appellant, initially for the slapping incident, and buoyed by the encouragement of those to whom she related her ordeal, eventually for rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  As she could no longer remember the exact dates of the previous incidents of rape, only the last, that which occurred on January 21, 1998, was made the basis of her complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br>Dr. Martinita Leobrera, who conducted on January 22, 1998 a physical examination of the then 20 year old private complainant, noted the presence of old healed hymenal lacerations at 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock positions, indicating positive signs of penetration.  She also observed that the private complainant's vaginal canal admitted two examining fingers freely with no resistance, indicating multiple instances of sexual penetration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>The evidence for the defense, consisting of the testimonies of appellant and the parties' neighbors-spouses Norlita and Alfredo Villa, proffers that appellant, a coco-lumber dealer and barangay captain of Barangay San Pedro, Luisiana, Laguna,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and the private complainant were live-in partners who were often seen sleeping together in the nude in the wee hours of the morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  <br><br>He could not have raped the private complainant on January 21, 1998, appellant contended, as he was engaged in a drinking spree with Alfredo Villa (Villa) from 10:00 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. the following morning, following which he and Villa proceeded to look for coconut trees which they were going to cut in connection with their business; and that thereafter, he repaired home, took a bath, and immediately departed to attend a session in Santa Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <br><br>Appellant's tale regarding the drinking spree was corroborated by Villa and his wife Norlita Villa, the latter adding that she was awake the entire night serving "<span style="font-style: italic;">pulutan</span>" to her husband and appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <br><br>As indicated early on, the trial court convicted appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of rape.  The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court finds the accused EMETERIO RICAMORA y SUELLO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of CONSUMMATED RAPE, defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659 and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the offended party MARY ROSE ROCREO the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as compensatory damages and the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) as moral damages and to pay the costs of the instant suit.<br></blockquote>The records of the case were originally transmitted to this Court for automatic review.  Conformably, however, with <span style="font-style: italic;">People of the Philippines v. Efren Mateo y Garcia</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  which modified Sections 3 and 10 of Rule 122, Section 13 of Rule 124, Section 3 of Rule 125 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure and any other rule insofar as they provide for direct appeals from the RTCs to the Supreme Court in cases where the penalty imposed is death, <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>, or life imprisonment, the case <span style="font-style: italic;">cum</span> records was, by Resolution of September 13, 2004, referred to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, by the assailed Decision, affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> the trial court's decision.<br><br>Hence, the present review, appellant assigning a single error:<br><blockquote>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.<br></blockquote>Appellant's basic contention is that the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> erred in upholding the trial court's giving full faith and credence to the testimony of the private complainant. <br><br>This Court has adopted an unrelenting position that when the question arises as to which of the conflicting versions of the prosecution and defense is worthy of belief, the assessment of the trial court is generally viewed as correct and entitled to great weight, it explaining as follows:<br><blockquote>In the resolution of the factual issues, the Court relies heavily on the trial court for its evaluation of the witnesses and their credibility.  Having the opportunity to observe them on the stand, the trial judge is able to detect that sometimes thin line between fact and prevarication that will determine the guilt or innocence of the accused.  That line may not be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the reviewing court.  The record will not reveal those tell-tale signs that will affirm the truth or expose the contrivance, like the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the forthright tone of a ready reply.  The record will not show if the eyes have darted in evasion or looked down in confession or gazed steadily with a serenity that has nothing to distort or conceal.  The record will not show if tears were shed in anger, or in shame, or in remembered pain, or in feigned innocence.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Only the judge trying the case can see all these and on the basis of his observations arrive at an informed and reasoned verdict.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Particularly in a rape case, conviction or acquittal more often than not depends entirely on the credibility of the private complainant's testimony, given that it is usually only she who can testify as to its occurrence. <br><br>When a woman then testifies that she had been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape had been committed, for as long as her testimony meets the test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  <br><br>Consider the following testimony <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on direct examination</span> of the private complainant:<br><blockquote><table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">In the year 1996 in the month of October, do you recall of any incident involving you and the herein accused Ricamora?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was that incident all about?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">That was the night when he first abused me, sir.

Under the circumstances attendant to the present case, the delay of respondent in reporting the incidents of rape may not be taken against her.<br><br>In any event, the subject of the complaint filed on January 22, 1998 by private complainant, which became the basis of the filing of the information, was the last incident of rape, that which occurred on January 21, 1998.  Any delay in the report of the previous commissions of rape is thus irrelevant to this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  <br><br>Respecting the sufficiency of evidence of force or intimidation as an element of rape, this Court takes note that appellant, as the common-law spouse of the private complainant's mother, exercised moral ascendancy over her which made his threats to her all the more real and effective, particularly since she and her younger siblings were left in his custody.  Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Manggasin</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  teaches:<br><blockquote>. . . Accused-appellant contends that, on both occasions when she was raped, complainant did not show a determined resistance. The sexual molestations of complainant started when she was just twelve (12) years of age and lasted until she was seventeen (17). Accused-appellant is the common-law spouse of complainant's mother and the family breadwinner. As already stated, <span style="font-weight: bold;">accused-appellant exercised a moral ascendancy over complainant which made the threats he made to her effective. Physical resistance need not be established in rape when intimidation is exercised upon the victim and the latter submits herself, against her will, to the rapist's embrace because of fear for life and personal safety. Complainant's complete obedience to accused-appellant's command, her lack of struggle against him, and her silence despite her sufferings were all caused by her fear of accused-appellant. In complainant's mind, she was convinced of the danger to her and her family. As has been aptly said, accused-appellant's moral ascendancy over the victim takes the place of violence and intimidation.</span> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In the same case, this Court, passing on the nature of the force or intimidation necessary to constitute rape, discoursed:<br><blockquote>For rape to exist<span style="font-weight: bold;"> it is not necessary that the force or intimidation employed be so great or of such character as could not be resisted. It is only necessary that the force or intimidation be sufficient to consummate the purpose which the accused had in mind. Intimidation must be viewed in the light of the victim's perception and judgment at the time of the rape and not by any hard and fast rule. It is therefore enough that it produces fear – fear that if the victim does not yield to the bestial demands of the accused, something would happen to her at the moment or thereafter, as when she is threatened with death if she reports the incident.</span> Intimidation would also explain why there are no traces of struggle which would indicate that the victim fought off her attacker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> [Emphasis supplied; citations omitted]<br></blockquote>As for appellant's invocation of the "sweetheart theory" as well his defense of alibi, the same fails to inspire belief. <br><br>By appellant's claim, after his relationship with the private complainant's mother ended when she left for Singapore in 1995, while he regularly went to the private complainant's house to take care of the livestock he had left there, he never slept there; but on October 7, 1997, however, on private complainant's request, he repaired to her house to cook during which she started kissing him which resulted to a consensual sexual intercourse, and he thereafter started sleeping at the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  <br><br>Appellant's neighbors-spouses Villa corroborated appellant's claim that he and private complainant were lovers.<br><br>The rule is well-settled that evidence to be believed must not only come from a credible source but must also be credible in itself such as one that the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>   The immediately foregoing version of the defense falls short of such standard.  It is difficult to believe that an 18 year-old barrio lass would initiate and consent to having an amorous affair with the common-law spouse of her own mother, under the same roof where she and her younger siblings are staying.<br><br>Defense witness-spouses Villa even claim having witnessed the parties' intimate acts.  That is too improbable to merit belief.  As the trial court observed:<br><blockquote>In his attempt with corroboration, the accused presented his neighbor-spouses NORLITA and ALFREDO VILLA.  The said spouses both testified in substance that they considered the accused and the complainant to be live-in partners as they were living under the same roof and that on several occasions both have witnessed the complainant and the accused as sleeping together, naked and embracing each other. x x x<br><br>The Court however, does not believe the unbelievable and strange story of the neighbor-spouses which not only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">borders on the improbable but also fantastic.  It would be the height of incredulity for live-in partners between a young lady and a middle age man to display for others to see their intimate moments for even married husband and wife will normally seek a place where they are alone together to perform their romantic encounters secure from possible prying eyes</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]  </sup>(Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Finally, appellant's defense of alibi must likewise fail.  For, for alibi to prosper, the accused must not only prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed.  He must also convincingly demonstrate the physical impossibility of his presence at the <span style="font-style: italic;">locus criminis</span> at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <br><br>In the case at bar, the house where appellant was alleged to have had a drinking session was admittedly only <span style="font-style: italic;">one meter away</span> from the private complainant's house where the rape was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>  Appellant's presence on the date and place of the commission of the crime has thus not been ruled out.<br><br>At all events, even if corroborated, alibi cannot stand in light of the positive identification by the private complainant who was not shown to have any ill motive for testifying falsely against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the challenged Decision of May 13, 2005 of the Court of Appeals is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup></span>Penned by Associate Justice Monina Arevalo-Zenarosa and concurred in by Associate Justices Remedios A.
