Moreover, these consultations had no relation to, or connection with, the above-mentioned labor complaints filed by former Taggat employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent insists that complainant's evidence failed to prove that when the criminal complaint was filed with the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Cagayan, respondent was still the retained counsel or legal consultant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33] </sup><br><br>While this disbarment case was pending, the Resolution and Order issued by respondent to file 651 Informations against complainant was reversed and set aside by Regional State Prosecutor of Cagayan Rodolfo B.

The IBP Board of Governors recommended the imposition of a penalty of three years suspension from the practice of law.&nbsp; The Report reads:<br><blockquote>Now the issue here is whether being a <span style="font-weight: bold;">former lawyer of Taggat</span> conflicts with his role as Assistant Provincial Prosecutor in deciding I.S. No. 97-240. A determination of this issue will require the test of whether the matter in I.S. No. 97-240 will conflict with his former position of Personnel Manager and Legal Counsel of Taggat.<br><br>I.S. No. 97-240 was filed for "<span style="font-style: italic;">Violation of Labor Code</span>" (s<span style="font-style: italic;">ee Resolution of the Provincial Prosecutors Office, Annex "B" of Complaint</span>). Herein Complainant, Ruthie Lim-Santiago, was being accused as having the "<span style="font-style: italic;">management and control"</span> of Taggat (p. 2, <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution of the Prov. Pros. Office, supra</span>).<br><br>Clearly, as a former Personnel Manager and Legal Counsel of Taggat, herein Respondent undoubtedly <span style="font-style: italic;">handled the personnel and labor concerns of Taggat.</span> Respondent, undoubtedly <span style="font-style: italic;">dealt with and related with</span> the employees of Taggat.&nbsp; Therefore, Respondent undoubtedly <span style="font-style: italic;">dealt with and related with complainants in I.S. No. 97-240</span>. The issues, therefore, in I.S. No. 97-240, are very much familiar with Respondent. While the issues of unpaid salaries pertain to the periods 1996-1997, the mechanics and personalities in that case are very much familiar with Respondent.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">A lawyer owes something to a former client.</span> Herein Respondent owes to Taggat, a former client, the duty to "<span style="font-style: italic;">maintain inviolate the client's confidence or to refrain from doing anything which will injuriously affect him in any matter in which he previously represented him</span>" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Natam v. Capule,</span> 91 Phil. 640; p. 231, Agpalo, Legal Ethics, 4th ed.)<br><br>Respondent argues that as Assistant Provincial Prosecutor, he does not represent any client or any interest except justice. It should not be forgotten, however, that a lawyer has an <span style="font-weight: bold;">immutable duty to a former client</span> with respect to matters that he previously handled for that former client. In this case, matters relating to <span style="font-style: italic;">personnel, labor policies,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">labor relations</span> that he previously handled as Personnel Manager and Legal Counsel of Taggat. I.S. No. 97-240 was for "<span style="font-style: italic;">Violation of the Labor Code.</span>"&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Here lies the conflict.</span> Perhaps it would have been different had I.S. No. 97-240 not been labor-related, or if Respondent had not been a Personnel Manager concurrently as Legal Counsel. But as it is, I.S. No. 97-240 is labor-related and Respondent was a former Personnel Manager of Taggat.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>While Respondent ceased his relations with Taggat in 1992 and the unpaid salaries being sought in I.S. No. 97-240 were of the years 1996 and 1997, the employees and management involved <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">are the very personalities he dealt with as Personnel Manager and Legal Counsel of Taggat.</span> Respondent dealt with these persons in his fiduciary relations with Taggat. Moreover, he was an employee of the corporation and part of its management.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As to the propriety of receiving "Retainer Fees" or "consultancy fees" from herein Complainant while being an Assistant Provincial Prosecutor, and for rendering legal consultancy work while being an Assistant Provincial Prosecutor, this matter had long been settled. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Government prosecutors are prohibited to engage in the private practice of law</span> (see Legal and Judicial Ethics, Ernesto Pineda, 1994 ed., p. 20; <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Villanueva,</span> 14 SCRA 109; <span style="font-style: italic;">Aquino v. Blanco</span> 70 Phil. 647). The act of being a legal consultant is a practice of law. To engage in the practice of law is to do any of those acts that are characteristic of the legal profession (In re: David, 93 Phil. 461). It covers any activity, in or out of court, which required the application of law, legal principles, practice or procedures and calls for legal knowledge, training and experience (<span style="font-style: italic;">PLA v. Agrava,</span> 105 Phil. 173; <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Villanueva,</span> 14 SCRA 111; <span style="font-style: italic;">Cayetano v. Monsod, </span>201 SCRA 210).<br><br>Respondent clearly violated this prohibition.<br><br>As for the secondary accusations of harassing certain employees of Taggat and instigating the filing of criminal complaints, we find the evidence insufficient.<br><br>Accordingly, Respondent should be found guilty of conflict of interest, failure to safeguard a former client's interest, and violating the prohibition against the private practice of law while being a government prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>The IBP Board of Governors forwarded the Report to the Court as provided under Section 12(b), Rule 139-B<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Rules of Court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Court</span><br></div><br>The Court exonerates respondent from the charge of violation of Rule 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility ("Code"). However, the Court finds respondent liable for violation of Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility against unlawful conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]&nbsp;</sup> Respondent committed unlawful conduct&nbsp; when he violated Section 7(b)(2) of the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees or Republic Act No. 6713 ("RA 6713").<br><br>Canon 6 provides that the Code "shall apply to lawyers in government service in the discharge of their official duties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> A government lawyer is thus bound by the prohibition "not [to] represent conflicting interests."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> However, this rule is subject to certain limitations. The prohibition to represent conflicting interests does not apply when no conflict of interest exists, when a written consent of all concerned is given after a full disclosure of the facts or when no true attorney-client relationship exists.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Moreover, considering the serious consequence of the disbarment or suspension of a member of the Bar, clear preponderant evidence is necessary to justify the imposition of the administrative penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Respondent is also mandated under Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 not to engage in "unlawful x x x conduct."&nbsp; Unlawful conduct includes violation of the statutory prohibition on a government employee to "engage in the private practice of [his] profession unless authorized by the Constitution or law, provided, that such practice will not conflict or tend to conflict with [his] official functions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Complainant's evidence failed to substantiate the claim</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">that respondent represented conflicting interests</span><br></div><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Quiambao v. Bamba</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court enumerated various tests to determine conflict of interests. One test of inconsistency of interests is whether the lawyer will be asked to use against his former client any confidential information acquired through their connection or previous employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In essence, what a lawyer owes his former client is to maintain inviolate the client's confidence or to refrain from doing anything which will injuriously affect him in any matter in which he previously represented him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>In the present case, we find no conflict of interests when respondent handled the preliminary investigation of the criminal complaint filed by&nbsp;&nbsp; Taggat employees in 1997.&nbsp; The issue in the criminal complaint pertains to non-payment of wages that occurred from 1 April 1996 to 15 July 1997. Clearly, respondent was no longer connected with Taggat during that period since he resigned sometime in 1992.<br><br>In order to charge respondent for representing conflicting interests, evidence must be presented to prove that respondent used against Taggat, his former client, any confidential information acquired through his previous employment. The only established participation respondent had with respect to the criminal complaint is that he was the one who conducted the preliminary investigation.&nbsp; On that basis alone, it does not necessarily follow that respondent used any confidential information from his previous employment with complainant or Taggat in resolving the criminal complaint. <br><br>The fact alone that respondent was the former Personnel Manager and Retained Counsel of Taggat and the case he resolved as government prosecutor was labor-related is not a sufficient basis to charge respondent for representing conflicting interests. A lawyer's immutable duty to a former client does not cover transactions that occurred beyond the lawyer's employment with the client.&nbsp; The intent of the law is to impose upon the lawyer the duty to protect the client's interests only on matters that he previously handled for the former client and not for matters that arose after the lawyer-client relationship has terminated. &nbsp;<br><br>Further, complainant failed to present a single iota of evidence to prove her allegations. Thus, respondent is not guilty of violating Rule 15.03 of the Code.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Respondent engaged in the private practice of law</span><br style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">while working as a government prosecutor</span><br></div><br>The Court has defined the practice of law broadly as&nbsp; — <br><blockquote>x x x any activity, in or out of court, which requires the application of law, legal procedure, knowledge, training and experience. "To engage in the practice of law is to perform those acts which are characteristics of the profession.&nbsp; Generally, to practice law is to give notice or render any kind of service, which device or service requires the use in any degree of legal knowledge or skill."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>"Private practice of law" contemplates a succession of acts of the same nature habitually or customarily holding one's self to the public as a lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Respondent argues that he only rendered consultancy services to Taggat intermittently and he was not a retained counsel of Taggat from 1995 to 1996 as alleged. This argument is without merit because the law does not distinguish between consultancy services and retainer agreement. For as long as respondent performed acts that are usually rendered by lawyers with the use of their legal knowledge, the same falls within the ambit of the term "practice of law."<br><br>Nonetheless, respondent admitted that he rendered his legal services to complainant while working as a government prosecutor.&nbsp; Even the receipts he signed stated that the payments by Taggat were for "Retainer's fee."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, as correctly pointed out by complainant, respondent clearly violated the prohibition in RA 6713. &nbsp;<br><br>However, violations of RA 6713&nbsp; are not subject to disciplinary action under the Code of Professional Responsibility unless the violations also constitute infractions of specific provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, the IBP has no jurisdiction to investigate violations of RA 6713 — the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees — unless the acts involved also transgress provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>Here, respondent's violation of RA 6713 also constitutes a violation of Rule 1.01 of Canon 1, which mandates that "[a] <span style="font-weight: bold;">lawyer shall not engage in unlawful,</span> dishonest, immoral or deceitful <span style="font-weight: bold;">conduct.</span>" &nbsp; Respondent's admission that he received from Taggat fees for legal services while serving as a government prosecutor is an unlawful conduct, which constitutes a violation of Rule 1.01. <br><br>Respondent admitted that complainant also charged him with unlawful conduct when respondent stated in his Demurrer to Evidence:<br><blockquote>In this instant case, the complainant prays that the respondent be permanently and indefinitely suspended or disbarred from the practice of the law profession and his name removed from the Roll of Attorneys on the following grounds:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>d)&nbsp; that respondent manifested gross misconduct and gross violation of his oath of office and in his dealings with the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">On the Appropriate Penalty on Respondent</span><br></div><br>The appropriate penalty on an errant lawyer depends on the exercise of sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Under Civil Service Law and rules, the penalty for government employees engaging in unauthorized private practice of profession is suspension for six months and one day to one year.[56]&nbsp; We find this penalty appropriate for respondent's violation in this case of Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, we find respondent Atty.
