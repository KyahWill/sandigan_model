Instead, defendant Eastern sought to escape liability on the defense that the damages attending the shipment occurred, or were discovered, when the same were already discharged from the vessel and were already in the custody of the consignee.<br><br>A review of the evidence presented shows, however, that contrary to the defendant's[-herein petitioner's] claim, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the two (2) cases of pre-sensitized plates were damaged while they were under the responsibility of the carrier, and were reported in bad order at the time they were discharged.</span><br><br>Upon leaving the vessel's tackle, prior to discharging the consignee's property, two cases containing the imported plates were reported to be in bad order by R and R Industrial Surveyors Inc., the cargo surveyors employed by defendant Eastern. (Exhibits "9" and "10") One of the cases were reported as "broken at one side" while the other was "badly broken."  It must be remarked that the cargo inside the broken cases consisted of pre-sensitized plates used for printing purposes.  They are light sensitive, such that any unwanted exposure to light will render them unsuitable for further use.  The slightest damage to their cases would necessarily result in their damage.<br><br>Apart from this, the arrastre operator Metroport Services, Inc. reported that two cases of the subject shipment "were discharged in bad order from the vessel and loss or damage arising therefrom is the vessel's responsibility." (Exhibit "F")<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, the appellate court disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal from the Judgment of the Regional Trial Court is hereby GRANTED.

However, the Court had recognized several exceptions to this rule, to wit:  (1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures;  (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;  (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion;  (4)<span style="font-style: italic;"> when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts</span>;  (5) <span style="font-weight: bold;">when the findings of facts are conflicting;</span>  (6) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee;  (7) <span style="font-weight: bold;">when the findings are contrary to the trial court;</span>  (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;  (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent;  (10) <span style="font-style: italic;">when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record;  and </span>(11) <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.</span> x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  (Emphasis supplied; italics in the original.)<br></blockquote>Petitioner draws attention to the consignee's demand letter to it which was earlier quoted, it pointing out that the documents therein mentioned referred to Cases Nos. 3 and 5, not to Case No. 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the damage to which is the subject of the present claim.<br><br>Further, petitioner points out that the survey conducted by the consignee's designated surveyor Audemus Adjustment Corporation, which found the contents of Case No. 4 to be damaged, was done only on July 26, 1985 and at the consignee's warehouse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> respondent alleges that the reports of petitioner's surveyor, R &amp; R Surveyors, show that the damage was found while the shipment was "on board prior to discharge/after leaving ship's tackle,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>To enlighten this Court whether the fault lies on petitioner, a consideration of the cargo receipts issued by petitioner, the turnover of survey of bad cargoes issued by arrastre operator Metro Port, and bad order cargo inspection report of petitioner-engaged R &amp; R Surveyors, as reflected in the following tabulation, is in order:<br>    <table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="23%">Case Number</td> <td valign="top" width="28%">Issued by Eastern Shipping Lines</td> <td valign="top" width="24%">Issued by Metro     Port</td> <td valign="top" width="25%">Issued by R &amp; R Surveyors</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top">Case    No. 1</td> <td valign="top">Good Order Cargo <u>Receipt</u> No. 152795 dated July 21, 1985    (Exh.

Three good order cargo receipts were issued by the ship owner which were signed by its checker and the representative of the arrastre operator. When the shipment arrived and was inspected at the warehouse of the consignee, a bundle-part of the shipment was missing. The arrastre operator thereupon issued a shortlanded certificate stating that the bundle was already missing when it received the shipment from the ship.<br><br>Relying more on the good order cargo receipts issued by the ship owner than on the short-landed certificate issued by the arrastre operator, the trial court, still in S<span style="font-style: italic;">umma Insurance,</span> held:<br><blockquote>As between the aforementioned two documentary exhibits, the Court is more inclined to give <span style="text-decoration: underline;">credence to the cargo receipts</span>. Said cargo receipts were signed by a checker of defendant NGSC and a representative of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Metro Port. It is safe to presume that the cargo receipts accurately describe the quantity and condition of the shipment when it was discharged</span> from the vessel. Metro Port's representative would not have signed the cargo receipts if only four (4) packages were discharged from the vessel and given to the possession and custody of the arrastre operator. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Having been signed by its representative, the Metro Port is bound by the contents of the cargo receipts.</span><br><br>On the other hand, the Metro Port's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shortlanded certificate</span> could not be given weight considering that, as correctly argued by counsel for defendant NGSC, it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">issued by Metro Port alone and was not countersigned by the representatives of the shipping company and the consignee.</span> Besides, the certificate was prepared by Atty. Servillano V. Dolina, Second Deputy General Manager of Metro Port, and there is no proof on record that he was present at the time the subject shipment was unloaded from the vessel and received by the arrastre operator.

If, as the marine survey showed, "it was evident that the contents had leaked as shown by stain marks on various parts of the containers," then, those stain marks should have been evident as well when defendant's Bad Order Certificate was prepared.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The consignee's representative would surely have noticed it and would have caused a notation to that effect</span> to have been made in the Bad Order Certificate.  The fact that the Certificate was silent on that point but that instead it specifically indicated that the contents, as detected upon survey at the consignee's warehouse, must have occurred after the cargo had left defendant's custody. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Italics in the original; underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hartford Fire Insurance</span>, in the present case, the July 26, 1985 Request for Bad Order Survey<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> issued by Metro Port which was signed by its representative and that of the consignee did not cover or refer to Case No. 4.<br><br>The form Report dated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">October 31, 1985</span> of Metro Port<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> wherein the blanks therein were, in so far as they are pertinent, filled up as follows:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;">xxx    </span> 2.
