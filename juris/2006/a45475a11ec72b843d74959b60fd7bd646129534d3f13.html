Jojo Muslim, were charged with Violation of Section 15, Article III, in relation to Section 21, Article 4 of Republic Act No. 6425, otherwise known as The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> An Amended Information was filed on 2 May 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 2 July 1996, a Second Amended Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was filed, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about April 12, 1996 at 3:30 o'clock in the afternoon more or less in S. Duterte St., Suba, Danao City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused in a buy bust operation, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver three (3) packs of white crystalline substance containing metamphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known as "shabu," a regulated drug, weighing .7 grams to informant decoy SPO2 Alicia A. Patiño for a total consideration of P2,400, without any permit from the proper authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The case was filed before Branch 25 of the RTC of Danao City and docketed as Criminal Case No. DNO-1532.<br><br>Petitioner Suson, together with Andres Camargo, was also charged with Illegal Possession of <span style="font-style: italic;">Shabu</span> and Firearm in Criminal Cases No. DNO-1533 and No. DNO-1534 before the same court.<br><br>When arraigned, petitioners, assisted by counsel <span style="font-style: italic;">de oficio,</span> pleaded "Not Guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thereafter, the three cases were tried jointly.<br><br>The facts which we find supported by evidence, are summarized by the Office of the Solicitor General and are quoted by the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>After conducting a few days earlier a surveillance on appellant Teresita Suson's house located at S. Duterte St., Suba, Danao City, the Narcotics Team of Cebu City, in coordination with the Danao City Police Station, proceeded to the said house in the afternoon of April 12, 1996 in order to make a "buy-bust" operation. SPO2 Alicia Patiño, a member of the Narcotics Team who met Suson on April 10, 1996 in order to buy shabu and who was told by the latter to come back on April 12, 1996, posed as the poseur-buyer.<br><br>SPO2 Patiño, who was then positioned outside the gate of Suson's house, called the latter in order to buy shabu. Answering the call, Suson went out of the house and, after receiving the total sum of P2,400.00 in marked bills, went back inside. Moments later, appellant Antonio Fortich approached SPO2 Patiño and handed to her three (3) packs of shabu.<br><br>Subsequently, Fortich went across the street and joined other persons who were playing mahjong. On the other hand, after SPO2 Patiño had made a pre-arranged signal, the police authorities accompanying her rushed towards Fortich and arrested him.<br><br>The packs of shabu which were handed to SPO2 Patiño were submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory which, after examining the same, found that the said items were "positive" of the regulated drug known as Methampetamine Hydrochloride.<br><br>Later in the afternoon of the same date, and after the police authorities were able to secure a Search Warrant (for the search of shabu from the house of Suson) from the trial court, said search warrant was implemented and the police companions of SPO2 Patiño, searched, in the presence of the barangay captain in the area, Suson's house. Thereupon, Suson was apprehended. The police was also able to recover, among others, the marked bills amounting to P1,180.00 from Suson's possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners contend that no buy-bust operation occurred and that the evidence - <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> and firearm - allegedly confiscated in their home was planted evidence.<br><br>On 30 September 1998, the trial court rendered its decision convicting petitioners of the crime of illegal sale of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> in Criminal Case No. DNO-1532, while acquitting petitioner Suson and Andres Camargo of the crimes of illegal possession of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> and firearm in Criminal Cases No. DNO-1533 and No. DNO-1534. The decretal portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, for proof beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds accused Antonio Fortich and Teresita Suson in Criminal Case No. DNO-1532 GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt for Violation of Section 15, Article III, in relation to Section 21, Article IV of Republic Act 6425, as amended, and in conformity with Supreme Court doctrine in Pp. vs. Simon, 234 SCRA 555, each accused is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of SIX (6) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of prision correccional as minimum to SIX (6) YEARS of prision correccional as maximum. The amount of P1,180 being the fruit of a crime is hereby confiscated in favor of the government<br><br>For lack of sufficient evidence, the Court hereby ACQUITS accused Andres Camargo and Teresita Suson from the crime of illegal possession of shabu and firearm, as charged in Crim. Case Nos. DNO-1533 and 1534. The amount of P34,770 and one (1) cellular phone marked "SIEMEN" are hereby ordered returned to said accused Teresita Suson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court declared that petitioners, by their concerted action, sold <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> powder to poseur-buyer SPO2 Alicia Patiño for P2,400.00, and that an hour after the sale, SPO3 Alejandro Biñan confiscated or recovered from petitioner Suson marked money used in the buy-bust operation amounting to P1,180.00 whose serial numbers corresponded to the serial numbers recorded in the log book kept by SPO3 Biñan as marked money used in said operation.<br><br>On 29 October 1998, petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals via a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 30 October 2001, the Court of Appeals affirmed <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> the RTC's decision in Criminal Case No. DNO-1532 and dismissed, for lack of merit, petitioners' appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> filed by petitioners was denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> on 26 February 2002.<br><br>Petitioners appeal their conviction before this Court grounded on the following:<br><blockquote><ol><li>THE DECISION OF THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPELAS AS WELL AS ITS RESOLUTION DENYING A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION THEREOF IN CA-GR.

It quoted part of the testimony of SPO2 Patiño as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">There was somebody, a male person who got outside and later I identified that male person named Jojo who was the one who delivered the thing to me.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was the thing delivered by Jojo to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Three (3) packs of shabu.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Then after that, what did Jojo tell you, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The gate was already opened when he delivered to me the shabu and after he delivered the shabu to me he went across [the road], and I asked him, where are you going, and he answered to me that he will play mahjong. . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br></blockquote>The lower court's decision partially reads:<br><blockquote>Prosecution would want to show that after surveillance conducted on April 8, 1996 in the residence of accused Antonio Fortich and Teresita Suson the Narcom in coordination with the Danao City Police conducted a buy-bust operation on accused. That with SPO2 Alicia Patino acting as poseur/buyer, a pre-arranged signal in the manner of combing her hair was agreed when actual bust-buying of shabu is consummated. That said Alicia Patino agreed to buy shabu from accused Teresita Suson who received the amount of P2,400.00 and a few minutes thereafter said accused Teresita Suson came back with a male companion named Antonio Fortich who delivered to Alicia Patino three (3) packs of shabu. Said accused Antonio Fortich then crossed the street towards where mahjong was played about 40 meters away. Upon the agreed signal, SPO3 Eduardo Misa proceeded to where Antonio Fortich was located and arrested him. Then followed by other raiding companions to the house of Andres Camargo where accused Teresita was located and arrested her. . .<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>After going over the Transcript of Stenographic Notes and the Decision of the RTC, it behooves us to have a second look on the evidence on record. It appears that the RTC's finding as to who delivered the shabu to SPO2 Patiño contradicts, or is not in accord with, SPO2 Patiño's testimony. From the testimony of SPO2 Patiño, it is clear that it was only petitioner Fortich who delivered to her the 3 packs of shabu. On the other hand, the RTC narrated that after petitioner Suson received the payment for the shabu and went inside her home, she came back out with petitioner Fortich who delivered or handed over the shabu to SPO2 Patiño. Petitioner would like to capitalize on the RTC's gaffe in making its findings of fact.<br><br>The question is: Can this inadvertence on the part of the RTC exonerate petitioners and cause the reversal of their conviction?<br><br>We do not think so.<br><br>It must be made clear that what controls are the statements in the Transcript of Stenographic Notes and not the findings of fact which is merely taken from the Transcript of Stenographic Notes and from other documentary exhibits. This Court is not prevented from going into the Transcript of Stenographic Notes to verify if the statements made by the witnesses are correctly integrated in the decision. If there are inaccuracies, this Court can rectify the same and be the basis of our decision.<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioners were convicted for Violation of Section 15 (Sale), Article III, in relation to Section 21 (Conspiracy), Article IV of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended.  Many times, this Court has already ruled that a buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment which has repeatedly been accepted to be a valid means of arresting violators of the Dangerous Drugs Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In every prosecution for illegal sale of prohibited or regulated drugs, the following elements must be established: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In proving that the sale was consummated, the prosecution presented the poseur buyer - SPO2 Patiño.<br><br>The testimony of SPO2 Patiño on the sale of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> is as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROSECUTOR GEROMO: continues</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">After the briefing on April 12, 1996, what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">After our lunch we proceeded here in Danao City all narcom Officers.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Can you tell the Court about how many were you who came here in Danao City?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Maybe ten (10) or twelve personnel.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">After that, what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">We contacted Major Castro.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you have a conference with Major Castro at that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">We have a conference but it was not done at the headquarters.

</tbody></table><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></sup><br></blockquote>The testimonial evidence was supported by the physical evidence on record. The three packs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> -- containing a white crystalline substance weighing .7 gram -- which were received from petitioner Fortich, were turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Camp Sotero Cabahug, Cebu City, for analysis. During trial, these three packs were submitted and marked in evidence. Police Inspector Myrna Areola, PNP Forensic Analyst, testified that the substance contained in the packs were positive for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span>. Said finding was indicated in Physical Science Report No. C-263-96.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Petitioners contend that the RTC decision is contrary to law and jurisprudence.  They claim that despite the failure of the raiding/searching team to submit an inventory of the confiscated articles to the court which issued the search warrant, the court still considered the<span style="font-style: italic;"> shabu</span> in convicting them.<br><br>This contention is untenable.<br><br>The instant case involves the sale of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> (Crim. Case No. DNO-1532) which is separate and distinct from Criminal Cases No. DNO-1533 and No. DNO-1534 involving Illegal Possession of <span style="font-style: italic;">Shabu</span> and Firearm. In the two latter cases, petitioner Suson and accused Camargo were acquitted. It is in this case for illegal possession of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> that the court stated that the raiding team allegedly did not make an inventory of the confiscated drugs. Nowhere in the decision did the court say that the lack of inventory referred to the case for the sale of shabu (Criminal Case No. DNO-1532). In the case for the sale of<span style="font-style: italic;"> shabu</span> which is now pending before this Court, no inventory or return of search warrant is required because the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> involved was not confiscated by virtue of a search warrant; same was obtained by the poseur- buyer because it was delivered to her by petitioner Fortich after payment was made to petitioner Suson. As previously discussed, the shabu sold to the poseur-buyer was subjected to laboratory examination and presented in court as evidence which clearly proves the identity of the drug. Thus, petitioners' reliance on the statement of the RTC that grave doubt is entertained as to the genuineness of the specimen for the searching team's failure to submit an inventory thereof, is misplaced.<br><br>To further cast doubts on the validity and regularity of the buy-bust operation, petitioners argue that the marked money allegedly used in the buy-bust was not officially marked since the same was merely recorded in a private logbook.<br><br>Such argument will not help petitioners get out of the predicament they are in. The recording of marked money used in a buy-bust operation is not one of the elements for the prosecution of sale of illegal drugs. The recording or non-recording thereof in an official record will not necessarily lead to an acquittal as long as the sale of the prohibited drug is adequately proven. In the case at bar, SPO2 Patiño, the poseur-buyer, testified on the circumstances regarding the sale of the <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> for which petitioners were charged and convicted. Settled is the rule that in the prosecution for the sale of dangerous drugs, the absence of marked money does not create a hiatus in the evidence for the prosecution as long as the sale of dangerous drugs is adequately proven and the drug subject of the transaction is presented before the court. Neither law nor jurisprudence requires the presentation of any money used in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> What is material to a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the <span style="font-style: italic;">corpus delicti</span> as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In the instant case, both were sufficiently shown by the prosecution.<br><br>Petitioners deny that a buy-bust operation took place and claim that the evidence against them is planted evidence.<br><br>We are not convinced. The defense of denial or frame-up, like alibi, has been viewed with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Denial is a weak form of defense, particularly when it is not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence just like in the case before us.<br><br>All told, the illegal sale of drugs having been established beyond reasonable doubt, we are constrained to uphold petitioners' conviction.<br><br>Finally, we determine the proper imposable penalty. The proper penalty to be imposed for the illegal sale of 0.7 gram of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> would be a <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correcional</span>, pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 20 of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended by Section 17 of Republic Act No. 7659 and in consonance with the doctrine laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v.
