Lolita Mercado, Branch Clerk of Court, to explain why Civil Case Nos. 2166, LRC No. 14, SP NO. 771, CAD 3-04 and LRC No. 18 have not been acted upon since the time of filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In compliance with the OCA's directive, Atty.

However, the plaintiffs failed to coordinate with the Sheriff. The matter was brought to the attention of the Presiding Judge for issuance of a court order requiring the appearance of the parties. During the preparation of the 2<sup>nd </sup>Semestral Inventory for calendar year 2003, this case was among the list which the undersigned recommended for archiving. The same was not, however, acted upon by the Presiding Judge.<br><br></li><li>LRC No. 14  Case was archived on 10 December 2004.<br><br></li><li>SP No. 771  Case was archived on 10 December 2004.<br><br></li><li>CAD Case No. 3-04  Set for hearing per Order dated 7 December 2004.<br><br></li><li>LRC No. 18  Case suspended pending compliance by the petitioner to submit a third copy of the application for registration and supporting documents which have to be sent to the Land Registration Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>For her part, Judge Blanco, in her letter dated March 22, 2005, explained that her failure to decide the cases within the reglementary period was due mainly to the lack of resource materials in her court. Thus, she often    needed to go elsewhere just to research on the applicable jurisprudence. She likewise claimed that it took her sometime to review some of the records because the transcript of stenographic notes were mere carbon copies and thus    were no longer legible.<br><br>Judge Blanco also put the blame on her Branch Clerk of Court, Atty. Mercado, for those cases that had not been acted upon for a considerable length of time. She averred that said cases were not brought to her attention by Atty. Mercado, thus, she failed to issue the proper orders. Judge Blanco stressed that Atty. Mercado had not been cooperative with her since her assumption to office.<br><br>Finally, she informed the Court that she had decided all the cases submitted for decision and resolution prior to her retirement on February 16, 2005 as evidenced by the certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> to this effect issued by Atty. Mercado.<br><br>After evaluating the records of the case in relation to the Judicial Audit Report, the OCA in a Memorandum dated June 10, 2005, recommended to the Court the following:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">JUDGE LOURDES M.G. BLANCO</span>, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 36, Carigara, Leyte, be <span style="font-weight: bold;">FINED</span> in the amount of <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIVE THOUSAND PESOS</span> (P5,000.00) for her failure to decide and resolve cases within the 90-day reglementary period which shall be deducted from her retirement benefits.<br><br></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ATTY. LOLITA R. MERCADO,</span> Branch Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Branch 36, Carigara, Leyte, be <span style="font-weight: bold;">FINED</span> in the amount of <span style="font-weight: bold;">ONE THOUSAND PESOS</span> (P1,000.00) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNED</span> that a repetition of the same will be dealt with more severely by the Court.<br><br></li><li>The Judicial Audit Report be docketed as an administrative complaint against Judge Blanco and Atty. Mercado.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In its resolution of July 18, 2005, the Court had the instant case docketed as a regular administrative matter, and required Judge    Blanco and Atty. Mercado to manifest whether they are submitting the same on the basis of the pleadings filed. In her manifestation of August 30, 2005, and duly noted by the Court, Atty. Mercado manifested her conformity thereto. On the other hand, in her letter dated September 16, 2005, Judge Blanco stated that she was leaving everything to the Court's sound judgment and requested that her retirement benefits be approved and released in due time. The letter was likewise duly noted by the Court.<br><br>We agree with the findings of the OCA but modify the recommended penalty.<br><br>Article VIII, Section 15(1) of the Constitution mandates lower court judges to decide a case within the reglementary period of 90 days.<br><br>Likewise, the Code of Judicial Conduct under Rule 3.05 of Canon 3 enunciates as follows:<br><blockquote>Rule 3.05 - A judge shall dispose of the court's business promptly and decide cases within the required periods.<br></blockquote>Rules prescribing the time within which certain acts must be done are indispensable to prevent needless delays in the orderly and speedy disposition of cases. Thus, the 90-day period is mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Court has consistently emphasized strict observance of this rule in order to minimize the twin problems of congestion and delay that have long plagued our courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Judge Blanco clearly violated both the Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct when she failed to decide 3 cases and resolve 11 motions within the reglementary period. This Court has always emphasized the need for judges to decide cases within the constitutionally prescribed 90-day period. Their failure to do so constitutes gross inefficiency which consequently warrants imposition of administrative sanctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Although Judge Bautista decided/resolved these cases before she retired on February 16, 2005, the length of delay in the decision/resolution thereof could not be ignored. Indeed, all the pending incidents and cases submitted for decision/resolution were acted upon by Judge Blanco long after the 90-day period expired, or immediately before her retirement, entailing years of delay with respect to some incidents, and even a delay of almost 5 years with respect to one incident submitted for resolution.<br><br>Any delay in the administration of justice, no matter how brief, deprives the litigant of his right to a speedy disposition of his case. Not only does it magnify the cost of seeking justice. It undermines the people's faith and confidence in the judiciary, lowers its standards and brings it to disrepute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Whenever a judge cannot decide a case promptly, all he has to do is to ask the Court for a reasonable extension of time to resolve it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In this case, however, Judge Blanco does not appear to have asked for an extension to resolve any of the overdue cases. Nor did she offer any satisfactory explanation for the delay. Respondent judge gave as an excuse the lack of resource materials in her court. Said excuse is lame and unacceptable. As a judge, she is expected to be resourceful and diligent in deciding cases as her duty to dispose of them within the prescribed period is mandated by no less than the Constitution itself.<br><br>Compounding her failure to decide cases on time is her inability to act on 72 cases despite the lapse of a considerable length of time. Judge Blanco conveniently lays the blame on her branch clerk of court. On this score, the Code of Judicial Conduct provides:<br><blockquote>Rule 3.08 - A judge should diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in court management, and facilitate the performance of the administrative functions of other judges and court personnel.<br><br>Rule 3.09 - A judge should organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, and require at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity.<br></blockquote>A judge has the primary responsibility of maintaining the professional competence of his staff and is charged with the administrative responsibility of organizing and supervising his court personnel to secure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Judge Blanco was remiss in her responsibility as a judge by failing to adopt a system of record management. Surely, she ought to know the cases pending in her sala and their status. She is expected to keep her own record of cases so that she may act on them with dispatch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> She cannot be allowed to blame her court personnel for her own incompetence or negligence. A judge cannot simply take refuge behind the inefficiency or mismanagement of his court personnel, for the latter are not the guardians of the former's responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the same manner, Branch Clerk of Court Lolita Mercado could not heap the blame on Judge Blanco and feel absolved of any liability for faulty court management. As clerk of court, Atty. Mercado is the administrative officer of the court who must ensure that a continuous physical inventory of cases is made on a monthly basis so that a judge is aware of the status of each case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Atty. Mercado should be reminded that the physical inventory of cases is instrumental to the expeditious dispensation of justice. It is only through this that a judge can keep himself abreast of the status of pending cases and informed that everything is in order in his court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The fact that the cases were eventually resolved and disposed of after the judicial audit had been conducted does not exculpate Atty. Mercado from administrative liability.  For her failure to act promptly on the court's business, she is deemed guilty of negligence.<br><br>Time and again, we stress that clerks of court are essential judicial officers who perform delicate administrative functions vital to the prompt and proper administration of justice. Their duty is, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia,</span> to assist in the management of the calendar of the court and in all matters that do not involve the discretion or judgment properly belonging to the judge. They play a key role in the complement of the court, as their office is the hub of adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and concerns. As such, they are required to be persons of competence, honesty and probity; they cannot be permitted to slacken on their jobs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>One final note. We would like to remind judges and branch clerks of court that they share the same duty and obligation to dispense justice promptly and speedily. In achieving this salutary purpose, their individual roles are corollary, even symbiotic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> They should, therefore, strive to work together and mutually assist each other in the pursuit of this goal.<br><br>Sections 9 and 11 of Rule 140, as amended by A.M.
