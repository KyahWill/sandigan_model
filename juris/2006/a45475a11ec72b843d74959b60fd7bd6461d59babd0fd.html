So <span style="font-style: italic;">Atty. Flores v. Hon.

The <span style="font-style: italic;">ordinary remedies</span> against errors or irregularities which may be regarded as normal in nature (i.e., error in appreciation or admission of evidence, or in construction or application of procedural or substantive law or legal principle) include a motion for reconsideration (or after rendition of a judgment or final order, a motion for new trial), and appeal. The <span style="font-style: italic;">extraordinary remedies</span> against error or irregularities which may be deemed extraordinary in character (i.e., whimsical, capricious, despotic exercise of power or neglect of duty, etc.) are <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span> the special civil actions of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari, prohibition or mandamus</span>, or a motion for inhibition, a petition for change of venue, as the case may be.<br><br>x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resort to and exhaustion of these judicial remedies, as well as the entry of judgment in the corresponding action or proceeding, are <span style="font-weight: bold;">pre-requisites for the taking of other measures</span> against the persons of the judges concerned, whether of civil, <span style="font-weight: bold;">administrative</span>, or criminal nature. It is <span style="font-weight: bold;">only after the available judicial remedies have been exhausted</span> and the appellate tribunals have spoken with finality, that the door to an inquiry into his criminal, civil or administrative liability may be said to have opened, or closed.</span><br><br>x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Law and logic decree that "administrative or criminal remedies are <span style="font-weight: bold;">neither alternative nor cumulative</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">judicial review</span> where such review is available, and must wait on the result thereof"</span> Indeed, since judges must be free to judge, without pressure or influence from external forces or factors, they should not be subject to intimidation, the fear of civil, criminal or administrative sanctions for acts they may do and dispositions they may make in the performance of        their duties and functions; x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>It is thus only after a questioned action of a judge in a pending case has been judicially resolved with finality that the door to an inquiry into his or her administrative liability may be said to have opened.<br><br>Parenthetically, during the pendency of the present petition or on April 15, 2005, the Second Division of this Court rendered a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> on the above-said administrative complaint filed by petitioners against public respondent.<br><br>On the merits of the petition for mandamus, Section 7 of Article III of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 7. The right of the people to information on <span style="font-weight: bold;">matters of public concern</span> shall be recognized. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Access to official records</span>, and to documents, and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">afforded</span> the citizen, <span style="font-weight: bold;">subject to such limitations as may be provided by law</span>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The above-quoted constitutional provision guarantees a general right - the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right to information</span> on matters of "public concern" and, as an accessory thereto, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right of access</span> to "official records" and the like.  The right to information on "matters of public concern or of public interest" is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both the purpose and the limit of the constitutional right of access to public documents</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Insofar as the right to information relates to judicial records, an understanding of the term "judicial record" or "court record" is in order.<br><br>The term "judicial record" or "court record" does not only refer to the orders, judgment or verdict of the courts. It comprises the official collection of all papers, exhibits and pleadings filed by the parties, all processes issued and returns made thereon, appearances, and word-for-word testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which took place during the trial and which are in the possession, custody, or control of the judiciary or of the courts for purposes of rendering court decisions. It has also been described to include any paper, letter, map, book, other document, tape, photograph, film, audio or video recording, court reporter's notes, transcript, data compilation, or other materials, whether in physical or electronic form, made or received pursuant to law or in connection with the transaction of any official business by the court, and includes all evidence it has received in a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In determining whether a particular information is of public concern, there is no right test. In the final analysis, it is for the courts to determine on a case to case basis whether the matter at issue is of interest or importance as it relates to or affect the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>It bears emphasis that the interest of the public hinges on its right to transparency in the administration of justice, to the end that it will serve to enhance the basic fairness of the judicial proceedings, safeguard the integrity of the fact-finding process, and foster an informed public discussion of governmental affairs.  Thus in <span style="font-style: italic;">Barretto v. Philippine Publishing Co.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>x x x The foundation of the right of the public to know what is going on in the courts is not the fact that the public, or a portion of it, is curious, or that what is going on in the court is news, or would be interesting, or would furnish topics of conversation; but is simply that it has a right to know whether a public officer is properly performing his duty. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In other words, the right of the public to be informed of the proceedings in court is not founded in the desire or necessity of people to know about the doing of others, but in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">necessity of knowing whether its servant, the judge, is properly performing his duty</span></span>. x x x<br><br>The case in Cowley vs. Pulsifer (137 Mass. 392) is so pertinent to the questions presented for our decision in the case at bar that we cannot refrain from quoting extensively therefrom. x x x<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><blockquote>x x x "The general advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public more than counterbalances the inconveniences to the private persons whose conduct may be the subject of such proceedings." x x x<br><br>"The chief advantage to the country to which we can discern, and that which we understand to be intended by the foregoing passage, is the security which publicity gives for the proper administration of justice. x x x <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is desirable that the trial of causes should take place under the public eye, not because the controversies of one citizen with another are of public concern, but because <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is of the highest moment that those who administer justice should act under the sense of public responsibility, and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed."</span></span><br></blockquote></div>From this quotation it is obvious that it was not the idea of the supreme court of Massachusetts to lay down the proposition that simply because a pleading happened to be filed in a public office it becomes public property that any individual, whether interested or not, had the right to publish its contents, or that any newspaper was privileged to scatter the allegations contained therein to the four corners of the country. The right of the public to know the contents of the paper is the basis of the privilege, which is, as we have said, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the right to determine by its own senses that its servant, the judge, is performing his duties according to law</span>. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Decisions and opinions of a court are of course matters of public concern or interest for these are the authorized expositions and interpretations of the laws, binding upon all citizens, of which every citizen is charged with knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Justice thus requires that all should have free access to the opinions of judges and justices, and it would be against sound public policy to prevent, suppress or keep the earliest knowledge of these from the public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, in <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Lantaco Sr. et al. v. Judge Llamas,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> this Court found a judge to have committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to furnish <span style="font-style: italic;">Lantaco et al.</span> a copy of his decision in a criminal case of which they were even the therein private complainants, the decision being "already part of the public record which the citizen has a right to scrutinize."<br><br>Unlike court orders and decisions, however, pleadings and other documents filed by parties to a case need not be matters of public concern or interest. For they are filed for the purpose of establishing the basis upon which the court may issue an order or a judgment affecting their rights and interests.<br><br>In thus determining which part or all of the records of a case may be accessed to, the purpose for which the parties filed them is to be considered.<br><br>In intestate proceedings, the heirs file pleadings and documents for the purpose of establishing their right to a share of the estate. As for the creditors, their purpose is to establish their claim to the estate and be paid therefor before the disposition of the estate.<br><br>Information regarding the financial standing of a person at the time of his death and the manner by which his private estate may ultimately be settled is not a matter of general, public concern or one in which a citizen or the public has an interest by which its legal rights or liabilities maybe affected. Granting unrestricted public access and publicity to personal financial information may constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy to which an individual may have an interest in limiting its disclosure or dissemination.<br><br>If the information sought then is not a matter of public concern or interest, denial of access thereto does not violate a citizen's constitutional right to information.<br><br>Once a particular information has been determined to be of public concern, the accessory right of access to official records, including judicial records, are open to the public.<br><br>The accessory right to access public records may, however, be restricted on a showing of good cause. How "good cause" can be determined, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <span style="font-style: italic;">Republican Company v.

"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">To determine whether good cause is shown, a judge must <span style="font-weight: bold;">balance the rights of the parties based on the particular facts of each case.</span></span>" In so doing, the judge "must take into account all relevant factors, "including, but not limited to, the nature of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the parties and the controversy, the type of information and the privacy interests involved, the extent of community interest</span>, and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reason for the request.</span>""<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted)<br></blockquote>And even then, the right is subject to inherent supervisory and protective powers of every court over its own records and files.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Supreme Court of Canada, expounding on the right of the court to exercise supervisory powers over materials surrendered into its care, held:<br><blockquote>It follows that the court, as the custodian of the exhibits, is bound to inquire into the use that is to be made of them and, in my view, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is fully entitled to regulate that use by securing appropriate undertakings and assurances if those be advisable to protect competing interests.</span> x x x<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In exercising its supervisory powers over materials surrendered into its care, the court may regulate the use made of it</span>.

The judge need not be bothered as long as the permission of the Clerk of Court has been sought and as long as a duly authorized representative of the court takes charge of the reproduction within the court premises if warranted or if not, the said court representative must bring along the case records where reproduction takes place and return the same intact to the Clerk of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, this Court finds the petition for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mandamus</span> meritorious, petitioners being "interested persons" who have a legitimate reason or purpose for accessing the records of the case.<br><br>Respecting the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prohibition</span> aspect of the petition, the same fails.<br><br>Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court which govern disqualification of judges provide:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <span style="font-style: italic;">Disqualification of judges</span>. - No judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor or otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the rules of the civil law, or in which he was presided in any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the record.<br><br>A judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just and valid reasons other than those mentioned above.<br><br>SECTION 2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Objection that judge disqualified, how made and effect</span>. - If it be claimed that an official is disqualified from sitting as above provided, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the <span style="font-weight: bold;">party</span> objecting to his competency</span> may, in writing, file with the official his objection, stating the grounds therefor, and the official shall thereupon proceed with the trial, or withdraw therefrom, in accordance with his determination of the question of his disqualification. His decision shall be forthwith made in writing and filed with the other papers in the case, but no appeal or stay shall be allowed from, or by reason of, his decision in favor of his own competency, until after final judgment in the case.
