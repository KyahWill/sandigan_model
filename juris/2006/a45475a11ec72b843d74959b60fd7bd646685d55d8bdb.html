This impelled the officers of Primelink to meet with the Lazatins and enabled the latter to review its business records/papers.&nbsp; In another Letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated October 22, 1997, the Lazatins informed Primelink that they had decided to rescind the JVA effective upon its receipt of the said letter.&nbsp; The Lazatins demanded that Primelink cease and desist from further developing the property.<br><br>Subsequently, on January 19, 1998, the Lazatins filed, with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tagaytay City, Branch 18, a complaint for rescission accounting and damages, with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction against Primelink and Lopez. &nbsp;The case was docketed as Civil Case No. TG-1776.&nbsp; Plaintiffs alleged, among others, that, despite the lapse of almost four (4) years from the execution of the JVA and the delivery of the title and possession of the land to defendants, the land development aspect of the project had not yet been completed, and the construction of the housing units had not yet made any headway, based on the following facts, namely: (a) of the 50 housing units programmed for Phase I, only the following types of houses appear on the site in these condition: (aa) single detached, one completed and two units uncompleted; (bb) cluster houses, one unit nearing completion; (cc) duplex, two units completed and two units unfinished; and (dd) row houses, two units, completed; (b) in Phase II thereof, all that was done by the defendants was to grade the area; the units so far constructed had been the object of numerous complaints by their owners/purchasers for poor workmanship and the use of sub-standard materials in their construction, thus, undermining the project's marketability. &nbsp;Plaintiffs also alleged that defendants had, without justifiable reason, completely disregarded previously agreed accounting and auditing procedures, checks and balances system installed for the mutual protection of both parties, and the scheduled regular meetings were seldom held to the detriment and disadvantage of plaintiffs. &nbsp;They averred that they sent a letter through counsel, demanding compliance of what was agreed upon under the agreement but defendants refused to heed said demand. &nbsp;After a succession of letters with still no action from defendants, plaintiffs sent a letter on October 22, 1997, a letter formally rescinding the JVA.<br><br>Plaintiffs also claimed that in a sales-income-costs projection prepared and submitted by defendants, they (plaintiffs) stood to receive the amount of P70,218,296.00 as their net share in the joint venture project; to date, however, after almost four (4) years and despite the undertaking in the JVA that plaintiffs shall initially get 20% of the agreed net revenue during the first two (2) years (on the basis of the 60%-40% sharing) and their full 40% share thereafter, defendants had yet to deliver these shares to plaintiffs which by conservative estimates would amount to no less than P40,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Plaintiffs prayed that, after due proceedings, judgment be rendered in their favor, thus:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court that a temporary restraining order be forthwith issued enjoining the defendants to immediately stop their land development, construction and marketing of the housing units in the aforesaid project; after due proceedings, to issue a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining and prohibiting said land development, construction and marketing of housing units, pending the disposition of the instant case.<br><br>After trial, a decision be rendered:<br><ol><li> Rescinding the Joint Venture Agreement executed between the plaintiffs and the defendants;<br><br></li><li> Immediately restoring to the plaintiffs possession of the subject parcels of land;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to render an accounting of all income generated as well as expenses incurred and disbursement made in connection with the project;<br><br></li><li>Making the Writ of Preliminary Injunction permanent;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the defendants, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs the amount Forty Million Pesos (P40,000,000.00) in actual and/or compensatory damages;<br><br></li><li> Ordering the defendants, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs the amount of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00) in exemplary damages;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiffs the amount equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total amount due as and for attorney's fees;

They prayed for the dismissal of the complaint under Section 1(j), Rule 16 of the Rules of Court:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that an Order be issued:<br><br>a) dismissing the Complaint on the basis of Section 1(j), Rule 16 of the aforecited Rules of Court, or, in the alternative,<br><br>b) requiring the plaintiffs to make initiatory step for arbitration by filing the demand to arbitrate, and then asking the parties to resolve their controversies, pursuant to the Arbitration Law, or in the alternative;<br><br>c) staying or suspending the proceedings in captioned case until the completion of the arbitration, and<br><br>d) denying the plaintiffs' prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.<br><br>Other reliefs and remedies just and equitable in the premises are prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>In the meantime, before the expiration of the reglementary period to answer the complaint, defendants, invoking their counsel's heavy workload, prayed for a 15-day extension<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> within which to file their answer. &nbsp;The additional time prayed for was granted by the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> &nbsp;However, instead of filing their answer, defendants prayed for a series of 15-day extensions in eight (8) successive motions for extensions on the same justification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> &nbsp;The RTC again granted the additional time prayed for, but in granting the last extension, it warned against further extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> &nbsp;Despite the admonition, defendants again moved for another 15-day extension,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which, this time, the RTC denied.&nbsp;

On April 17, 2000, the RTC rendered a Decision, the dispositive part of which reads:<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants as follows: <br><blockquote><ol><li>Ordering the rescission of the Joint Venture Agreement as of the date of filing of this complaint;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to return possession, including all improvements therein, of the real estate property belonging to the plaintiffs which is described in, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-10848 of the Register of Deeds of Tagaytay City, and located in Barangay Anulin, City of Tagaytay;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendants to turn over all documents, records or papers that have been executed, prepared and retained in connection with any contract to sell or deed of sale of all lots/units sold during the effectivity of the joint&nbsp;

These violations are not limited to those made against the plaintiffs alone as it appears that some of the unit buyers themselves have their own separate gripes against the defendants as typified by the letters (Exhibits "G" and "H") of Mr. Emmanuel Enciso.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Rummaging through the evidence presented in the course of the testimony of Mrs. Maminta on August 6, 1998 (Exhibits "N," "O," "P," "Q" and "R" as well as submarkings, pp. 60 to 62, TSN August 6, 1998) this court has observed, and is thus convinced, that a pattern of what appears to be a scheme or plot to reduce and eventually blot out the net income generated&nbsp; from sales of housing units by defendants, has been established. Exhibit "P-2" is explicit in declaring that, as of September 30, 1995, the joint venture project earned a net income of about P2,603,810.64. This amount, however, was drastically reduced in a subsequent financial report submitted by the defendants to P1,954,216.39. Shortly thereafter, and to the dismay of the plaintiffs, the defendants submitted an income statement and a balance sheet (Exhibits "R" and &nbsp; "R-1") indicating a net loss of P5,122,906.39 as of June 30, 1997.<br><br>Of the reported net income of P2,603,810.64 (Exhibit "P-2") the plaintiffs should have received the sum of P1,041,524.26 representing their 40% share under paragraph II and V of the JVA. But this was not to be so. Even before the plaintiffs could get hold of their share as indicated above, the defendants closed the chance altogether by declaring a net loss.

At the time respondents contributed the two parcels of land, consisting of 30,000 square meters to the joint venture project when the JVA was signed on March 10, 1994, the said properties were worth not more than P500.00 per square meter, the "price tag" agreed upon the parties for the purpose of the JVA.&nbsp; Moreover, before respondents rescinded the JVA sometime in October/November 1997, the property had already been substantially developed as improvements had already been introduced thereon; petitioners had likewise incurred administrative and marketing expenses, among others, amounting to more or less P40,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioners point out that respondents did not pray in their complaint that they be declared the owners and entitled to the possession of the improvements made by petitioner Primelink on the property;

consequently, it can be effected only when respondents can return whatever they may be obliged to return.&nbsp; Respondents who sought the rescission of the JVA must place petitioner Primelink in the status <span style="font-style: italic;">quo</span>.&nbsp; They insist that respondents cannot rescind and, at the same time, retain the consideration, or part of the consideration received under the JVA.&nbsp; They cannot have the benefits of rescission without assuming its burden.&nbsp; All parties must be restored to their original positions as nearly as possible upon the rescission of a contract.&nbsp; In the event that restoration to the status <span style="font-style: italic;">quo</span> is impossible, rescission may be granted if the Court can balance the equities and fashion an appropriate remedy that would be equitable to both parties and afford complete relief.<br><br>Petitioners insist that being defaulted in the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> would in no way defeat their claim for reimbursement because "[w]hat matters is that the improvements exist and they cannot be denied."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> &nbsp;Moreover, they point out, the ruling of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurbach v.

Sanitary Wares Manufacturing Corporation</span>, the Supreme Court discussed the following points regarding joint ventures and partnership:<blockquote>The legal concept of a joint venture is of common law origin.&nbsp; It has no precise legal definition, but it has been generally understood to mean an organization formed for some temporary purpose.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">Gates v. Megargel,</span> 266 Fed. 811 [1920])&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is, in fact, hardly distinguishable from the partnership, since elements are similar – community of interest in the business, sharing of profits and losses, and a mutual right of control.</span>&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">Blackner v. McDermott</span>, 176 F.2d 498 [1949]; <span style="font-style: italic;">Carboneau v. Peterson</span>, 95 P.2d 1043 [1939]; <span style="font-style: italic;">Buckley v. Chadwick</span>, 45 Cal.2d 183, 288 P.2d 12, 289 P.2d 242 [1955])&nbsp; The main distinction cited by most opinions in common law jurisdictions is that the partnership contemplates a general business with some degree of continuity, while the joint venture is formed for the execution of a single transaction, and is thus of a temporary nature.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">Tuffs v. Mann</span>, 116 Cal.App. 170, 2 P.2d 500 [1931]; <span style="font-style: italic;">Harmon v. Martin</span>, 395 III. 595, 71 N.E.2d 74 [1947]; <span style="font-style: italic;">Gates v. Megargel</span>, 266 Fed. 811 [1920])&nbsp; This observation is not entirely accurate in this jurisdiction, since under the Civil Code, a partnership may be particular or universal, and a particular partnership may have for its object a specific undertaking.&nbsp; (Art. 1783, Civil Code).&nbsp; It would seem therefore that, <span style="font-weight: bold;">under Philippine law, a joint venture is a form of partnership and should thus be governed by the laws of partnership</span>.&nbsp; The Supreme Court has, however, recognized a distinction between these two business forms, and has held that although a corporation cannot enter into a partnership contract, it may, however, engage in a joint venture with others.&nbsp; (At p. 12, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tuazon v. Bolanos,</span> 95 Phil. 906 [1954]; Campos and Lopez – Campos Comments, Notes and Selected Cases, Corporation Code 1981)&nbsp; (Emphasis Supplied)</blockquote>The LAZATINs were able to establish fraud on the part of PRIMELINK which, in the words of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, was a pattern of what appears to be a scheme or plot to reduce and eventually blot out the net incomes generated from sales of housing units by the defendants.&nbsp; Under Article 1838 of the Civil Code, where the partnership contract is rescinded on the ground of the fraud or misrepresentation of one of the parties thereto, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the party entitled to rescind is, without prejudice to any other right is entitled to a lien on, or right of retention of, the surplus of the partnership property</span> after satisfying the partnership liabilities to third persons for any sum of money paid by him for the purchase of an interest in the partnership and for any capital or advance contributed by him.&nbsp; In the instant case, the joint venture still has outstanding liabilities to third parties or the buyers of the property.<br><br>It is not amiss to state that title to the land or TCT No. T-10848 which is now held by Chinabank for safekeeping pursuant to the Escrow Agreement executed between Primelink Properties and Development Corporation and Ma.

They likewise stress that they did not enrich themselves at the expense of petitioners.<br><br>In reply, petitioners assert that it is unjust and inequitable for respondents to retain the improvements even if their share in the P1,041,524.26 of the net income of the property and the sale of the land were to be deducted from the value of the improvements, plus administrative and marketing expenses in the total amount of P40,000,000.00.&nbsp; Petitioners will still be entitled to an accounting from respondents.&nbsp; Respondents cannot deny the existence and nature of said improvements as they are visible to the naked eye.<br><br>The threshold issues are the following: (1) whether respondents are entitled to the possession of the parcels of land covered by the JVA and the improvements thereon introduced by petitioners as their contribution to the JVA; (2) whether petitioners are entitled to reimbursement for the value of the improvements on the parcels of land.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>On the first issue, we agree with petitioners that respondents did not specifically pray in their complaint below that possession of the improvements on the parcels of land which they contributed to the JVA be transferred to them. &nbsp;Respondents made a specific prayer in their complaint that, upon the rescission of the JVA, they be placed in possession of the parcels of land subject of the agreement, and for other "reliefs and such other remedies as are just and equitable in the premises."&nbsp; However, the trial court was not precluded from awarding possession of the improvements on the parcels of land to respondents in its decision.&nbsp; Section 2(c), Rule 7 of the Rules of Court provides that a pleading shall specify the relief sought but it may add as general prayer for such further or other relief as may be deemed just and equitable.&nbsp; Even without the prayer for a specific remedy, proper relief may be granted by the court if the facts alleged in the complaint and the evidence introduced so warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; The court shall grant relief warranted by the allegations and the proof even if no such relief is prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>&nbsp; The prayer in the complaint for other reliefs equitable and just in the premises justifies the grant of a relief not otherwise specifically prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The trial court was not proscribed from placing respondents in possession of the parcels of land and the improvements on the said parcels of land.&nbsp;

The trial court declared that respondents were entitled to the possession not only of the parcels of land but also of the improvements thereon as a consequence of its finding that petitioners breached their agreement and defrauded respondents of the net income under the JVA.<br><br>On the second issue, we agree with the CA ruling that petitioner Primelink and respondents entered into a joint venture as evidenced by their JVA which, under the Court's ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurbach</span>, is a form of partnership, and as such is to be governed by the laws on partnership.<br><br>When the RTC rescinded the JVA on complaint of respondents based on the evidence on record that petitioners willfully and persistently committed a breach of the JVA, the court thereby dissolved/cancelled the partnership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; With the rescission of the JVA on account of petitioners' fraudulent acts, all authority of any partner to act for the partnership is terminated except so far as may be necessary to wind up the partnership affairs or to complete transactions begun but not yet finished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; On dissolution, the partnership is not terminated but continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; Winding up means the administration of the assets of the partnership for the purpose of terminating the business and discharging the obligations of the partnership.<br><br>The transfer of the possession of the parcels of land and the improvements thereon to respondents was only for a specific purpose: the winding up of partnership affairs, and the partition and distribution of the net partnership assets as provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>&nbsp; After all, Article 1836 of the New Civil Code provides that unless otherwise agreed by the parties in their JVA, respondents have the right to wind up the partnership affairs:<blockquote>Art. 1836.&nbsp; Unless otherwise agreed, the partners who have not wrongfully dissolved the partnership or the legal representative of the last surviving partner, not insolvent, has the right to wind up the partnership affairs, provided, however, that any partner, his legal representative or his assignee, upon cause shown, may obtain winding up by the court.</blockquote>It must be stressed, too, that although respondents acquired possession of the lands and the improvements thereon, the said lands and improvements remained partnership property, subject to the rights and obligations of the parties, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter se</span>, of the creditors and of third parties under Articles 1837 and 1838 of the New Civil Code, and subject to the outcome of the settlement of the accounts between the parties as provided in Article 1839 of the New Civil Code, absent any agreement of the parties in their JVA to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>&nbsp; Until the partnership accounts are determined, it cannot be ascertained how much any of the parties is entitled to, if at all.<br><br>It was thus premature for petitioner Primelink to be demanding that it be indemnified for the value of the improvements on the parcels of land owned by the joint venture/partnership. &nbsp;Notably, the JVA of the parties does not contain any provision designating any party to wind up the affairs of the partnership.<br><br>Thus, under Article 1837 of the New Civil Code, the rights of the parties when dissolution is caused in contravention of the partnership agreement are as follows:<br><br><table style="border-collapse: collapse;
