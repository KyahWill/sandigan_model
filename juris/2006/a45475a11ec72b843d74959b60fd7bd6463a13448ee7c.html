However, no written authorization of Dorado was needed because the Complaint was actually filed by respondent, and not merely through Dorado as her attorney-in-fact.  As correctly observed by the CA, respondent herself  signed the verification attached to the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  She stated therein that she is the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 3091-V-89 and that she caused the preparation of the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  Respondent also personally testified on the facts alleged in her Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup>  In reality, respondent acted for and by herself, and not through any representative,  when she filed the Complaint.  Therefore, respondent being the real party in interest, by virtue of  the then prevailing Articles 166<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and 173<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of the Civil Code, the Complaint she filed sufficiently stated a cause of action. The sufficiency of the Complaint was not affected by the inclusion of Dorado as party representative for this was an obvious error which, under Section 11 of Rule 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23] </sup> is not a ground for dismissal, as it may be corrected by the court, on its own initiative and at any stage of the action,  by dropping such party from the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [24]</sup><br><br>Anent the second ground, there is no merit to petitioners' claim that they are purchasers in good faith.<br><br>That the SPA is a forgery is a finding of the RTC and the CA on a question of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  The same is conclusive upon the Court, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> especially as it is based on the expert opinion of the NBI which constitutes more than clear, positive and convincing evidence that respondent did not sign the SPA, and on the uncontroverted Certification of Dorado that respondent was in Germany working as a nurse when the SPA was purportedly executed in 1987.<br><br>The SPA being a forgery, it did not vest in Pedro any authority to alienate the subject property without the consent of respondent.  Absent such marital consent, the deed of sale was a nullity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>But then petitioners disclaim any participation in the forgery of the SPA or in the unauthorized sale of the subject property.  They are adamant that  even with their knowledge that respondent was in Germany at the time of the sale, they acted in good faith when they bought the subject property from Pedro alone because the latter was equipped with a SPA which contains a notarial acknowledgment that the same is valid and authentic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  They invoke the status of buyers in good faith whose registered title in the property is already indefeasible and against which the remedy of reconveyance is no longer available.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  In the alternative, petitioners offer that should respondent be declared entitled to reconveyance, let it affect her portion only but not that of Pedro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Whether or not petitioners are buyers for value in good faith is a question of fact not cognizable by us in a petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  We resolve only questions of law; we do not try facts nor examine testimonial or documentary evidence on record.  We leave these to the trial and appellate courts to whose findings and conclusions we accord great weight and respect, especially when their findings concur.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  We may have at times reversed their findings and conclusions but we resort to this only under exceptional circumstances as when it is shown that said courts failed to take into account certain relevant facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> No such exceptional circumstance obtains in the present case for we find the conclusions of the RTC and CA supported by the established facts and applicable law.  However, we do not fully subscribe to some of their views on why petitioners cannot be considered in good faith, as we will discuss below.<br><br>A holder of registered title may invoke the status of a buyer for value in good faith as a defense against any action questioning his title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup>Such status, however, is never presumed but must be proven by the person invoking it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>A buyer for value in good faith is one who buys property of another, without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays full and fair price for the same, at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claim or interest of some other persons in the property.  <i><b>He buys the property with the well-founded  belief that the person from whom he receives the thing had title to the property and capacity to convey it</b></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>To prove good faith, a buyer of registered and titled land need only show that he relied on the face of the title to the property.  He need not prove that he made further inquiry for he is not obliged to explore beyond the four corners of the title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>  Such degree of proof of good faith, however, is sufficient only when the following conditions concur:  first, the seller is the registered owner of the land; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> second, the latter is in possession thereof;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and third, at the time of the sale, the buyer was not aware of any claim or interest of some other person in the property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or of any defect or restriction in the title of the seller or in his capacity to convey title to the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Absent one or two of the foregoing conditions, then the law itself puts the buyer on notice and obliges the latter to exercise a higher degree of diligence by scrutinizing the certificate of title and examining all factual circumstances in order to determine the seller's title and capacity to transfer any interest in the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  Under such circumstance, it is no longer sufficient for said buyer to merely show that he relied on the face of the title; he must now also show that he exercised reasonable precaution by inquiring beyond the title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  Failure to exercise such degree of precaution makes him a buyer in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the present case, petitioners were dealing with a seller (Pedro) who had title to and possession of the land but, as indicated on the face of his title, whose capacity to sell was restricted, in that the marital consent of respondent is required before he could convey the property.  To prove good faith then, petitioners must show that they inquired not only into the title of Pedro but also into his capacity to sell.<br><br>According to petitioners, to determine Pedro's capacity to sell, they  conducted the following forms of inquiry: first, they inspected the photocopy of the SPA presented to them by Pedro;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> second, they brought said copy to Atty. Lorenzo Lucero (the notary public who prepared the deed of sale) and asked whether it was genuine;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46] </sup> and third, they inspected the original copy of the SPA after they advanced payment of Php55,000.00 to Pedro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Essentially, petitioners relied on the SPA, specifically on its  notarial acknowledgment which states that respondent appeared before the notary public and acknowledged having executed the SPA in favor of Pedro.<br><br>The RTC and CA, however, found such inquiry superficial.  They expected of petitioners an investigation not only into the whereabouts of respondent at the time of the execution of the SPA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> but also into the genuineness of the signature appearing on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We find such requirements of the RTC and CA too stringent that to adopt them would be to throw commerce into madness where buyers run around to probe the circumstances surrounding each piece of sales document while sellers scramble to produce evidence of its good order.  Remember that it is not just any scrap of paper that is under scrutiny but a SPA, the execution and attestation of which a notary public has intervened.<br><br>To what extent, therefore, should an inquiry into a notarized special power of attorney go in order for one to qualify as a buyer for value in good faith?<br><br>We agree with one author who said:<br><blockquote>x x x To speak of "notice", as applied to the grantee, is to follow the language of the Statue of Elizabeth. Its proviso protects the man who purchases <b><i>"upon good consideration and bona fide * * * not having at the time * * * any manner of notice or knowledge."</i></b>  The term "notice", however, is really but an approach to the test of good faith, and all modern legislation tends toward that point.<br><br>Thus, some present day statutes (outside of the Uniform Law) may speak of notice, actual and constructive, and define both terms, but they should be "liberally construed, so as to protect <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value."  They may require the grantee to have "knowledge" of the debtor's intent, but save for technical purposes of pleading, the term is read in the light of the rules we are studying. It comes always to a question of the grantee's good faith as distinct from mere negligence. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>There must, indeed, be more than negligence.  There must be a conscious turning away from the subject x x x.  <b><i>As put by the Supreme Court, the grantee must take the consequences if he "chooses to remain ignorant of what the necessities of the case require him to know."  The search, therefore, is described by the question, did the grantee make a choice between not knowing and finding out the truth; or were the circumstances such that he was not faced with that choice?</i></b> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>This means that   no automatic correlation exists between the state of forgery of a document and the bad faith of the buyer who relies on it.  A test has to be done whether the buyer had a choice between knowing the forgery and finding it out, or he had no such choice at all.<br><br>When the document under scrutiny  is a special power of attorney that is <b><i>duly notarized</i></b>, we know it to be a public document where the notarial acknowledgment is prima facie evidence of the fact of its due execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> A buyer presented with such a document would have no choice between knowing and finding out whether a forger lurks beneath the signature on it.  The notarial acknowledgment has removed that choice from him and replaced it with a presumption sanctioned by law that the affiant appeared before the notary public and acknowledged that he executed the document, understood its import and signed it. In reality, he is deprived of such choice not because he is incapable of knowing and finding out but because, under our notarial system, he has been given the luxury of merely relying on the presumption of regularity of a duly notarized SPA.  And he cannot be faulted for that because it is precisely that fiction of regularity which holds together commercial transactions across borders and time.<br><br>In sum, <b><i>all things being equal</i></b>, a person dealing with a seller who has possession and title to the property but whose capacity to sell is restricted, qualifies as a buyer in good faith if he proves that he inquired into the title of the seller as well as into the latter's capacity to sell; and that in his inquiry, he relied on the notarial acknowledgment found in the seller's <i><b>duly notarized</b></i> special power of attorney.  He need not prove anything more for it is already the function of the notarial acknowledgment to establish the appearance of the parties to the document, its due execution and authenticity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Note that we expressly made the foregoing rule applicable only under the operative words "duly notarized" and "all things being equal."  Thus, said rule should not apply when there is an apparent flaw afflicting the  notarial acknowledgment of the special power of attorney as would cast doubt on the due execution and authenticity of the document; or when the buyer has actual notice of circumstances outside the document that would render suspect its genuineness.<br><br>In <i>Domingo v. Reed</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> we found that the special power of attorney relied upon by the buyers contained a defective notarial acknowledgment in that it stated there that only the agent-wife signed the document before the notary public while the principal-husband did not.  Such flaw rendered the notarial acknowledgment of no effect and reduced the special power of attorney into a private document.  We declared the buyer who relied on the private special power of attorney a buyer in bad faith.<br><br>In <i>Lao v. Villones-Lao</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and <i>Estacio v. Jaranilla</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we found that the buyers knew of circumstances extrinsic to the special power of attorney which put in question the actual execution of said document.  In <i>Domingo Lao</i>, the buyer knew that the agent-wife was estranged from the principal-husband but was living within the same city.  In the <i>Estacio</i> case, we found admissions by the buyers that they knew that at the time of the purported execution of the special power of attorney, the alleged principal was not in the Philippines.  In both cases we held that the buyers were not in good faith, not because we found any outward defect in the notarial acknowledgment of the special powers of attorney, but because the latter had actual notice of facts that should have put them on deeper inquiry into  the capacity to sell of the seller.<br><br>In the present case, petitioners knew that Berlina was in Germany at the time they were buying the property and the SPA relied upon by  petitioners has a defective notarial acknowledgment.  The SPA was a mere photocopy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and we are not convinced that there ever was an original copy of said SPA as it was only this photocopy that was testified to by petitioner Nida Bautista and offered into evidence by her counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>  We emphasize this fact because it was actually this photocopy that was relied upon by petitioners before they entered into the deed of sale with Pedro.  As admitted to by petitioner Nida Bautista, upon inspection of the photocopy of the SPA, they gave Pedro an advanced payment of Php55,000.00; this signifies that, without further investigation on the SPA, petitioners had agreed to buy the subject property from Pedro.<br><br>But then said photocopy of the SPA contains no notarial seal.  A notarial seal is a mark, image or impression on a document which would indicate that the notary public has <b><i>officially signed it</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  There being no notarial seal, the signature of the notary public on the notarial certificate was therefore incomplete.  The notarial certificate being deficient, it was as if the notarial acknowledgment was unsigned.  The photocopy of the SPA has no notarial acknowledgment to speak of.  It was a mere private document which petitioners cannot foist as a banner of good faith.<br><br>All told,  it was not sufficient evidence of good faith that petitioners merely relied on  the photocopy of the SPA as this turned out to be a mere private document.  They should have adduced  more evidence that they looked beyond it.  They did not.  Instead, they took no precautions at all.  They verified with Atty. Lucero whether the SPA was authentic but then the latter was not the notary public who prepared the document.  Worse, they purposely failed to inquire who was the notary public who prepared the SPA.  Finally, petitioners conducted the transaction in haste. It took them all but three days or from March 2 to 4, 1988 to enter into the deed of sale, notwithstanding the restriction on the capacity to sell of Pedro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  In no way then may petitioners qualify as buyers for value in good faith.<br><br>That said, we come to the third issue on whether petitioners may retain the portion of Pedro Silva in the subject property.  Certainly not.  It is well-settled that the nullity of the sale of conjugal property contracted by the husband without the marital consent of the wife affects the entire property, not just the share of the wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>  We see no reason to deviate from this rule.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
