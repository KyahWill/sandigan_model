NYD-451 (Bus 451) and NYA-886 (Bus 886).<br><br>Philippine Rabbit Bus 676 was driven by Maximo Dabu &nbsp;while Aladdin Transit Bus 451 and Bus 886 were driven by Esteban Zipagan and Anacleto Villarico, respectively.<br><br>As a result of the accident, the rear right bumper and rear right side body including the engine compartment cover of Philippine Rabbit Bus 676 were dented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> &nbsp;The rear body of Aladdin Transit Bus 451 was also dented, while the front portion and body of Aladdin Transit Bus 886 were heavily damaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The estimated cost of repair of Philippine Rabbit Bus 676 was in the total amount of P30,107.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> A written demand<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> for Aladdin Transit to settle the said amount was sent but it remained unheeded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Philippine Rabbit thus filed on September 16, 1996 with the RTC of Quezon City a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> for damages against Aladdin Transit and its drivers, praying for the payment of the cost of repair in the amount of P30,107.00, unrealized income of&nbsp; P231, 302.25 for the 45 days that Bus 676 was under repair, as well as interests and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Attached to the complaint was a verification and certification of non-forum shopping signed by Philippine Rabbit's counsel, Atty.

And it reiterated its claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>By way of counterclaim, Aladdin Transit sought to recover P15,000 for each of its two damaged buses, unrealized income of P210,000.00 for 30 days that they were under repair, exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On the scheduled pre-trial on August 22, 1997, Aladdin Transit was declared as in default and Philippine Rabbit was allowed to present evidence ex parte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The trial court, holding Aladdin Transit and its Bus 886 driver Villarico solidarily liable for the vehicular accident, rendered judgment in favor of Philippine Rabbit, disposing as follows:<br><blockquote>Wherefore, judgment is hereby ordered against the defendants Anacl[e]to Villarico and Aladdin Transit Corporation and in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants Villarico and Aladdin to pay jointly and severally the following: <br><ol><li>The sum of Thirty Thousand One Hundred Seven Pesos (P30,107.00) as the cost of repair of the damaged vehicle plus legal interest until the amount is fully paid;</li><br><li>The sum of P231,302.25 representing the unrealized revenue;</li><br><li>Attorney's fees in the reduced amount of P20,000.00 plus appearance fee of P750.00; and</li><br><li>Cost of suit.<br></li></ol>The complaint against defendant Esteban Zipagan is hereby DISMISSED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Aladdin Transit's motion for reconsideration was denied.<br><br>Before the Court of Appeals to which Aladdin Transit appealed, it faulted the trial court in not dismissing the complaint due to defective verification and certification of non-forum shopping;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> in denying its motion for reconsideration/new trial in light of the abandonment of the case by its former counsel;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in finding it negligent in the selection and supervision of its employees;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and in awarding damages to Philippine Rabbit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>By Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of April 29, 2004, the appellate court reversed and set aside the decision of the trial court.
