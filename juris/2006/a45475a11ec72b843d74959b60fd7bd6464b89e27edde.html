				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><i><u>The Case</u></i><br><br>For review is the <i>Decision</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals  in CA- G.R. CR HC No. 01139 promulgated on 2 September 2005, affirming with modification the <i>Judgment</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 41, in Criminal Case No. 01-188424 promulgated on 13 October 2003, finding appellant Edna Malngan <i>y</i> Mayo (Edna) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of "Arson with Multiple Homicide or Arson resulting to the death of six (6) people," and sentencing her to suffer the penalty of death.<br><br><i><u>The Facts</u></i><br><br>As summarized<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> by the Court of Appeals,   the antecedent facts are as follows:<br><blockquote>From the personal account of Remigio Bernardo, the Barangay Chairman in the area, as well as the personal account of the pedicab driver named Rolando Gruta, it was at around 4:45 a.m. on January 2, 2001 when Remigio Bernardo and his tanods saw the accused-appellant EDNA, one hired as a housemaid by Roberto Separa, Sr., with her head turning in different directions, hurriedly leaving the house of her employer at No. 172 Moderna Street, Balut, Tondo, Manila. She was seen to have boarded a pedicab which was driven by a person later identified as Rolando Gruta. She was heard by the pedicab driver to have instructed that she be brought to Nipa Street, but upon her arrival there, she changed her mind and asked that she be brought instead to Balasan Street where she finally alighted, after paying for her fare.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, at around 5:15 a.m. Barangay Chairman Bernardo's group later discovered that a fire gutted the house of the employer of the housemaid. Barangay Chairman Bernardo and his tanods responded to the fire upon hearing shouts from the residents and thereafter, firemen from the Fire District 1-NCR arrived at the fire scene to contain the fire.<br><br>When Barangay Chairman Bernardo returned to the Barangay Hall, he received a report from pedicab driver Rolando Gruta, who was also a tanod, that shortly before the occurrence of the fire, he saw a woman (the housemaid) coming out of the house at No. 172 Moderna Street, Balut, Tondo, Manila and he received a call from his wife telling him of a woman (the same housemaid) who was acting strangely and suspiciously on Balasan Street. Barangay Chairman Bernardo, Rolando Gruta and the other tanods proceeded to Balasan Street and found the woman who was later identified as the accused-appellant. After Rolando Gruta positively identified the woman as the same person who left No. 172 Moderna Street, Balut, Tondo, Manila, Barangay Chairman Bernardo and his tanods apprehended her and brought her to the Barangay Hall for investigation. At the Barangay Hall, Mercedita Mendoza, neighbor of Roberto Separa, Sr. and whose house was also burned, identified the woman as accused-appellant EDNA who was the housemaid of Roberto Separa, Sr. Upon inspection, a disposable lighter was found inside accused- appellant EDNA's bag. Thereafter, accused-appellant EDNA confessed to Barangay Chairman Bernardo in the presence of multitudes of angry residents outside the Barangay Hall that she set her employer's house on fire because she had not been paid her salary for about a year and that she wanted to go home to her province but her employer told her to just ride a broomstick in going home.<br><br>Accused-appellant EDNA was then turned over to arson investigators headed by S[F]O4  Danilo Talusan, who brought her to the San Lazaro Fire Station in Sta. Cruz, Manila where she was further investigated and then detained.<br><br>When Mercedita Mendoza went to the San Lazaro Fire Station to give her sworn statement, she had the opportunity to ask accused-appellant EDNA at the latter's detention cell why she did the burning of her employer's house and accused-appellant EDNA replied that she set the house on fire because when she asked permission to go home to her province, the wife of her employer Roberto Separa, Sr., named Virginia Separa (sic) shouted at her: <i>"Sige umuwi ka, pagdating mo maputi ka na. Sumakay ka sa walis, pagdating mo maputi ka na"</i> (TSN, January 22, 2002, p.6) ("Go ahead, when you arrive your color would be fair already. Ride a broomstick, when you arrive your color would be fair already.") And when Mercedita Mendoza asked accused-appellant EDNA how she burned the house, accused-appellant EDNA told her: <i>"Naglukot ako ng maraming diyaryo, sinindihan ko ng disposable lighter at hinagis ko sa ibabaw ng lamesa sa loob ng bahay"</i> (TSN, January 22, 2002, p. 7.) ("I crumpled newspapers, lighted them with a disposable lighter and threw them on top of the table inside the house.")<br><br>When interviewed by Carmelita Valdez, a reporter of ABS-CBN Network, accused-appellant EDNA while under detention (sic) was heard by SFO4 (sic) Danilo Talusan as having admitted the crime and even narrated the manner how she accomplished it. SFO4 (sic) Danilo Talusan was able to hear the same confession, this time at his home, while watching the television program "True Crime" hosted by Gus Abelgas also of ABS-CBN Network.<br><br>The fire resulted in [the] destruction of the house of Roberto Separa, Sr. and other adjoining houses and the death of Roberto Separa, Sr. and Virginia Separa together with their four (4) children, namely: Michael, Daphne, Priscilla and Roberto, Jr.</blockquote>On 9 January 2001, an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was filed before the RTC of Manila, Branch 41, charging accused-appellant with the crime of <i>Arson with Multiple Homicide.</i>  The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 01-188424.

He testified that his house was also gutted by the fire that killed the Separa family and that he tried to help said victims but to no avail.<br><br>The prosecution presented other documentary evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and thereafter rested its case.<br><br>When it came time for the defense to present exculpatory evidence, instead of doing so, accused- appellant filed a <i>Motion to Admit Demurrer to Evidence</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and the corresponding <i>Demurrer to Evidence</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> with the former expressly stating that said Demurrer to Evidence was being filed "x x x without express leave of court x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In her <i>Demurrer to Evidence</i>, accused-appellant asserts that the prosecution's evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the following reasons:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (a) that she is charged with crime not defined and penalized by law; (b) that circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt; and (c) that the testimonies given by the witnesses of the prosecution were hearsay, thus, inadmissible in evidence against her.<br><br>The prosecution filed its <i>Comment/Opposition</i> to accused-appellant's Demurrer to Evidence.<br><br>On 13 October 2003, acting on the Demurrer to Evidence, the RTC promulgated its <i>Judgment</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> wherein it proceeded to resolve the subject case based on the evidence of the prosecution. The RTC considered accused-appellant to have waived her right to present evidence, having filed the <i>Demurrer to Evidence</i> without leave of court.<br><br>In finding accused-appellant Edna guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Arson with Multiple Homicide, the RTC ruled that:<br><blockquote>The first argument of the accused that she is charged with an act not defined and penalized by law is without merit. x x x the caption which charges the accused with the crime of Arson with Multiple Homicide is merely descriptive of the charge of Arson that resulted to Multiple Homicide. The fact is that the accused is charged with Arson which resulted to Multiple Homicide (death of victims) and that charge is embodied and stated in the body of the information. What is controlling is the allegation in the body of the Information and not the title or caption thereof. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The second and third arguments will be discussed jointly as they are interrelated with each other. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[W]hile there is no direct evidence that points to the accused in the act of burning the house or actually starting the subject fire, the following circumstances that show that the accused intentionally caused or was responsible for the subject fire have been duly established:<br><br><ol><li>that immediately before the burning of the house, the accused hurriedly and with head turning in different directions (palinga-linga) went out of the said house and rode a pedicab apparently not knowing where to go x x x;<br><br></li><li>that immediately after the fire, upon a report that there was a woman in Balasan St. who appears confused and apprehensive (balisa), the Barangay Chairman and his tanods went there, found the accused and apprehended her and brought her to the barangay hall as shown by the testimony of Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo; and<br><br></li><li>that when she was apprehended and investigated by the barangay officials and when her bag was opened, the same contained a disposable lighter as likewise shown by the testimony of the Barangay Chairman.</li></ol>[T]he timing of her hurried departure and nervous demeanor immediately before the fire when she left the house and rode a pedicab and her same demeanor, physical and mental condition when found and apprehended at the same place where she alighted from the pedicab and the discovery of the lighter in her bag thereafter when investigated indisputably show her guilt as charged.<br><br>If there is any doubt of her guilt that remains with the circumstantial evidence against her, the same is removed or obliterated with the confessions/admissions of the commission of the offense and the manner thereof that she made to the prosecution witnesses Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo, Mercedita Mendoza and to the media, respectively.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>[H]er confessions/admissions are positive acknowledgment of guilt of the crime and appear to have been voluntarily and intelligently given.

Presently, there are two (2) laws that govern the crime of arson where death results therefrom- <i>Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 7659,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and Section 5 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1613</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>, quoted hereunder, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Revised Penal Code:</b><br><br>ART. 320. <i>Destructive Arson.</i> - x x x x<br>If <u>as a <i>consequence of the commission</i></u><i> of any of the acts penalized under this Article, <u>death results</u></i>, the <u>mandatory penalty of death shall be imposed</u>.

The <i>raison d'être</i> is that arson is itself the end and death is simply the consequence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Whether the crime of arson will absorb the resultant death or will have to be a separate crime altogether, the joint discussion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of the late Mr. Chief Justice Ramon C. Aquino and Mme. Justice Carolina C. Griño-Aquino, on the subject of the crimes of arson and murder/homicide, is highly instructive:<br><blockquote>Groizard says that when fire is used with the intent to kill a particular person who may be in a house and that objective is attained by burning the house, the crime is murder only. When the Penal Code declares that killing committed by means of fire is murder, it intends that fire should be purposely adopted as a means to that end. There can be no murder without a design to take life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In other words, if the main object of the offender is to kill by means of fire, the offense is murder. But if the main objective is the burning of the building, the resulting homicide may be absorbed by the crime of arson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>If the house was set on fire after the victims therein were killed, fire would not be a qualifying circumstance. The accused would be liable for the separate offenses of murder or homicide, as the case may be, and arson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>Accordingly, in cases where both burning and death occur, in order to determine what crime/crimes was/were perpetrated - whether arson, murder or arson and homicide/murder, it is <i>de rigueur</i> to ascertain the main objective of the malefactor: (a) if the main objective is the burning of the building or edifice, but death results by reason or on the occasion of arson, the crime is simply <i>arson</i>, and the resulting homicide is absorbed; (b) if, on the other hand, the main objective is to kill a particular person who may be in a building or edifice, when fire is resorted to as the means to accomplish such goal the crime committed is <i>murder</i> only; lastly, (c) if the objective is, likewise, to kill a particular person, and in fact the offender has already done so, but fire is resorted to as a means to cover up the killing, then there are two separate and distinct crimes committed - <i>homicide/murder and arson</i>.<br><br>Where then does this case fall under?<br><br>From a reading of the body of the Information:<br><blockquote>That on or about January 2, 2001, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, <i><u>with intent to cause damage</u></i>, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and <i><u>deliberately set fire upon the two-storey residential house</u></i> of ROBERTO SEPARA and family mostly made of wooden materials located at No. 172 Moderna St., Balut, Tondo, this city, by lighting crumpled newspaper with the use of disposable lighter inside said house knowing the same to be an inhabited house and situated in a thickly populated place and as a consequence thereof a conflagration ensued and the said building, together with some seven (7) adjoining residential houses, were razed by fire; <i><u>that by reason and on the occasion of the said fire</u></i>, the following, namely,<br></blockquote><ol style="margin-left: 80px;"><li>Roberto Separa, Sr., 45 years of age</li><li>Virginia Separa y Mendoza, 40 years of age</li><li>Michael Separa, 24 years of age</li><li>Daphne Separa, 18 years of age</li><li>Priscilla Separa, 14 years of age</li><li>Roberto Separa, Jr., 11 years of age</li></ol><blockquote>sustained burn injuries which were the direct cause of their death immediately thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>accused-appellant is being charged with the crime of arson. It it is clear from the foregoing that her intent was merely to destroy her employer's house through the use of fire.<br><br>We now go to the issues raised. Under the first assignment of error, in asserting the insufficiency of the prosecution's evidence to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt, accused-appellant argues that the prosecution was only able to adduce circumstantial evidence - hardly enough to prove her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. She ratiocinates that the following circumstances:<br><blockquote><ol><li>That immediately before the burning of the house , the accused hurriedly and with head turning in different directions (palinga-linga) went out of the said house and rode a pedicab apparently not knowing where to go for she first requested to be brought to Nipa St. but upon reaching there requested again to be brought to Balasan St. as shown by the testimony of prosecution witness Rolando Gruta;<br><br></li><li>That immediately after the fire, upon a report that there was a woman in Balasan St. who appears confused and apprehensive (<i>balisa</i>), the Barangay Chairman and his tanods went there, found the accused and apprehended her and brought her to the barangay hall as shown by the testimony of Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo; and<br><br></li><li>That when she was apprehended and investigated by the barangay officials and when her bag was opened, the same contained a disposable lighter as likewise shown by the testimony of the Barangay Chairman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>fall short of proving that she had any involvement in setting her employer's house on fire, much less show guilt beyond reasonable doubt, given that "it is a fact that housemaids are the first persons in the house to wake up early to perform routine chores for their employers,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> one of which is preparing and cooking the morning meal for the members of the household; and necessity requires her to go out early to look for open stores or even nearby marketplaces to buy things that will complete the early meal for the day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  She then concludes that it was normal for her to have been seen going out of her employer's house in a hurry at that time of the day and "to look at all directions to insure that the house is secure and that there are no other persons in the vicinity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>We are far from persuaded.<br><br>True, by the nature of their jobs, housemaids are required to start the day early; however, contrary to said assertion, the actuations and the demeanor of accused-appellant on that fateful early morning as observed firsthand by Rolando Gruta, one of the witnesses of the prosecution, belie her claim of normalcy, to wit:<br><blockquote>Q: You said you saw Edna coming out from the house of the Separa Family. What happened when you saw Edna coming out from the house of the Separa Family?<br><br>A: <i>"Wala pa pong ano 'yan naisakay ko na siya sa sidecar."<br></i><br>Q: And what did you observe from Edna when you saw her coming out from the house of the Separa family?<br><br>A: "<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Nagmamadali po siyang lumakad at palinga-linga</span>."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: After she boarded your pedicab, what happened, if any?<br><br>A: <i>"Nagpahatid po siya sa akin."</i><br><br>Q: Where?<br><br>A: To Nipa Street, sir.<br><br>Q: Did you bring her to Nipa Street as she requested?<br><br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q: You said that you brought her to Nipa Street.

The timing of her hurried departure and nervous demeanor immediately before the fire when she left the house and rode a pedicab and her same demeanor, physical and mental condition when found and apprehended at the same place where she alighted from the pedicab and the discovery of the lighter in her bag thereafter when investigated indisputably show her guilt as charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>All the witnesses are in accord that accused-appellant's agitated appearance was out of the ordinary. Remarkably, she has never denied this observation.<br><br>We give great weight to the findings of the RTC and so accord credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as it had the opportunity to observe them directly.  The credibility given by trial courts to prosecution witnesses is an important aspect of evidence which appellate courts can rely on because of its unique opportunity to observe them, particularly their demeanor, conduct, and attitude, during the direct and cross-examination by counsels.  Here, Remigio Bernardo, Rolando Gruta and Mercedita Mendoza are disinterested witnesses and there is not an iota of evidence in the records to indicate that they are suborned witnesses.  The records of the RTC even show that Remigio Bernardo, the Barangay Chairman, kept accused-appellant from being mauled by the angry crowd outside of the barangay hall:<br><br>Pros. Rebagay:<br><br>Now, who were present when the accused are (sic) telling you this?<br><br>A: "Iyon nga iyong mga tanod ko, mamamayan doon nakapaligid, siyempre may sunog nagkakagulo, gusto nga siyang kunin ng mga mamamayan para saktan hindi ko maibigay papatayin siya gawa ng may namatay eh anim na tao and namatay, kaya iyong mga tao kinokontrol siya madidisgrasya siya dahil pin-pointed po siya, Your Honor, iyong dami na iyon libo iyong nakapaligid doon sa barangay hall napakahirap awatin.

Such proposition defies logic.  And where the defense failed to show any evil or improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses, the presumption is that their testimonies are true and thus entitled to full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>While the prosecution witnesses did not see accused-appellant actually starting the fire that burned several houses and killed the Separa family, her guilt may still be established through circumstantial evidence provided that: (1) there is more than one circumstance; (2) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and, (3) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Circumstantial evidence is that evidence which proves a fact or series of facts from which the facts in issue may be established by inference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  It is founded on experience and observed facts and coincidences establishing a connection between the known and proven facts and the facts sought to be proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  In order to bring about a conviction, the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain, which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of others, as the guilty person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In this case, the interlocking testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, taken together, exemplify a case where conviction can be upheld on the basis of circumstantial evidence.  First, prosecution witness Rolando Gruta, the driver of the pedicab that accused-appellant rode on, testified that he knew for a fact that she worked as a housemaid of the victims, and that he positively identified her as the person hurriedly leaving the house of the victims on 2 January 2001 at 4:45 a.m., and acting in a nervous manner.  That while riding on the pedicab, accused-appellant was unsure of her intended destination. Upon reaching the place where he originally picked up accused-appellant only a few minutes after dropping her off, Rolando Gruta saw the Separas' house being gutted by a blazing fire.  Second, Remigio Bernardo testified that he and his <i>tanods</i>, including Rolando Gruta, were the ones who picked up accused-appellant Edna at Balasan Street (where Rolando Gruta dropped her off) after receiving a call that there was a woman acting strangely at said street and who appeared to have nowhere to go.  Third, SPO4 Danilo Talusan overheard accused-appellant admit to Carmelita Valdez, a reporter of Channel 2 (ABS-CBN) that said accused-appellant started the fire, plus the fact that he was able see the telecast of Gus Abelgas' show where accused-appellant, while being interviewed, confessed to the crime as well. The foregoing testimonies juxtaposed with the testimony of Mercedita Mendoza validating the fact that accused-appellant confessed to having started the fire which killed the Separa family as well as burned seven houses including that of the victims, convincingly form an unbroken chain, which leads to the unassailable conclusion pinpointing accused-appellant as the person behind the crime of simple arson.<br><br>In her second assigned error, accused-appellant questions the admissibility of her uncounselled extrajudicial confession given to prosecution witnesses, namely Remigio Bernardo, Mercedita Mendoza, and to the media. Accused-appellant Edna contends that being uncounselled extrajudicial confession, her admissions to having committed the crime charged should have been excluded in evidence against her for being violative of Article III, Section 12(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>Particularly, she takes exception to the testimony of prosecution witnesses Remigio Bernardo and Mercedita Mendoza for being hearsay and in the nature of an uncounselled admission.<br><br>With the above vital pieces of evidence excluded, accused-appellant is of the position that the remaining proof of her alleged guilt, consisting in the main of circumstantial evidence, is inadequate to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>We partly disagree.<br><br>Article III, Section 12 of the Constitution in part provides:<br><blockquote>(1)     Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.  These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3)     Any confession or admission obtained in violation of this Section or Section 17 hereof shall be inadmissible in evidence.</blockquote>We have held that the abovequoted provision applies to the stage of custodial investigation - when the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but starts to focus on a particular person as a suspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>  Said constitutional guarantee has also been extended to situations in which an individual has not been formally arrested but has merely been "invited" for questioning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>To be admissible in evidence against an accused, the extrajudicial confessions made must satisfy the following requirements:<br><blockquote>(1) it must be voluntary;<br>(2) it must be made with the assistance of competent and independent counsel;<br>(3) it must be express; and<br>(4)     it must be in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><i>Arguably</i>, the barangay tanods, including the Barangay Chairman, in this particular instance, <i>may</i> be deemed as law enforcement officer for purposes of applying Article III, Section 12(1) and (3), of the Constitution. When accused-appellant was brought to the barangay hall in the morning of 2 January 2001, she was already a suspect, actually the only one, in the fire that destroyed several houses as well as killed the whole family of Roberto Separa, Sr.  She was, therefore, already under custodial investigation and the rights guaranteed by Article III, Section 12(1), of the Constitution should have already been observed or applied to her. Accused-appellant's confession to Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo was made in response to the "interrogation" made by the latter - admittedly conducted without first informing accused-appellant of her rights under the Constitution or done in the presence of counsel.  For this reason, the confession of accused-appellant, given to Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo, as well as the lighter found by the latter in her bag are inadmissible in evidence against her as such were obtained in violation of her constitutional rights.<br><br>Be that as it may, the inadmissibility of accused-appellant's confession to Barangay Chairman Remigio Bernardo and the lighter as evidence do not automatically lead to her acquittal.  It should well be recalled that the constitutional safeguards during custodial investigations do not apply to those not elicited through questioning by the police or their agents but given in an ordinary manner whereby the accused verbally admits to having committed the offense as what happened in the case at bar when accused-appellant admitted to Mercedita Mendoza, one of the neighbors of Roberto Separa, Sr., to having started the fire in the Separas' house.  The testimony of Mercedita Mendoza recounting said admission is, unfortunately for accused-appellant, admissible in evidence against her and is not covered by the aforesaid constitutional guarantee. Article III of the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights, solely governs the relationship between the individual on one hand and the State (and its agents) on the other; it does not concern itself with the relation between a private individual and another private individual - as both accused-appellant and prosecution witness Mercedita Mendoza undoubtedly are.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  Here, there is no evidence on record to show that said witness was acting under police authority, so appropriately, accused-appellant's uncounselled extrajudicial confession to said witness was properly admitted by the RTC.<br><br>Accused-appellant likewise assails the admission of the testimony of SPO4 Danilo Talusan.  Contending that "[w]hen SPO4 Danilo Talusan testified in court, his story is more of events, which are not within his personal knowledge but based from accounts of witnesses who derived information allegedly from the accused or some other persons x x x".  In other words, she objects to the testimony for being merely hearsay.  With this imputation of inadmissibility, we agree with what the Court of Appeals had to say:<br><blockquote>Although this testimony of SFO4 Danilo Talusan is hearsay because he was not present when Gus Abelgas interviewed accused-appellant EDNA, it may nevertheless be admitted in evidence as an independently relevant statement to establish not the truth but the tenor of the statement or the fact that the statement was made [People v. Mallari, G.R. No. 103547, July 20, 1999, 310 SCRA 621 citing People v. Cusi, Jr., G.R. No. L-20986, August 14, 1965, 14 SCRA 944.]. In <i>People vs. Velasquez, G.R. Nos. 132635 &amp; 143872-75, February 21, 2001, 352 SCRA 455</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that:</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>"Under the doctrine of independently relevant statements, regardless of their truth or falsity, the fact that such statements have been made is relevant. The hearsay rule does not apply, and the statements are admissible as evidence. Evidence as to the making of such statement is not secondary but primary, for the statement itself may constitute a fact in issue or be circumstantially relevant as to the existence of such a fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>As regards the confession given by accused-appellant to the media, we need not discuss it further for the reporters were never presented to testify in court.<br><br>As a final attempt at exculpation, accused-appellant asserts that since the identities of the burned bodies were never conclusively established, she cannot be responsible for their deaths.<br><br>Such assertion is bereft of merit.<br><br>In the crime of arson, the identities of the victims are immaterial in that intent to kill them particularly is not one of the elements of the crime. As we have clarified earlier, the killing of a person is absorbed in the charge of arson, simple or destructive.  The prosecution need only prove, that the burning was intentional and that what was intentionally burned is an inhabited house or dwelling.  Again, in the case of <i>People v. Soriano</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> we explained that:<br><blockquote>Although intent may be an ingredient of the crime of Arson, it may be inferred from the acts of the accused. There is a presumption that one intends the natural consequences of his act; and when it is shown that one has deliberately set fire to a building, the prosecution is not bound to produce further evidence of his wrongful intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>The ultimate query now is which kind of arson is accused-appellant guilty of?<br><br>As previously discussed, there are two (2) categories of the crime of arson: 1) <i>destructive arson</i>, under Art. 320 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659; and 2) <i>simple arson</i>, under Presidential Decree No. 1613.  Said classification is based on the kind, character and location of the property burned, regardless of the value of the damage caused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>Article 320 of <i>The Revised Penal Code,</i> as amended by RA 7659, contemplates the malicious burning of <b>structures, both public and private, hotels, buildings, edifices, trains, vessels, aircraft, factories and other military, government or commercial establishments by any person or group of persons</b>.[<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>]  The classification of this type of crime is known as <u><i>Destructive Arson,</i></u> which is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. The reason for the law is self- evident: to effectively discourage and deter the commission of this dastardly crime, to prevent the destruction of properties and protect the lives of innocent people. Exposure to a brewing conflagration leaves only destruction and despair in its wake; hence, the State mandates greater retribution to authors of this <i>heinous crime</i>. The exceptionally severe punishment imposed for this crime takes into consideration the extreme danger to human lives exposed by the malicious burning of these structures; the danger to property resulting from the conflagration; the fact that it is normally difficult to adopt precautions against its commission, and the difficulty in pinpointing the perpetrators; and, the greater impact on the social, economic, security and political fabric of the nation. [Emphasis supplied.]<br><br>If as a consequence of the commission of any of the acts penalized under Art. 320, death should result, the mandatory penalty of death shall be imposed.<br><br>On the other hand, PD 1613 which repealed Arts. 321 to 326-B of The Revised Penal Code remains the governing law for <i><u>Simple Arson.</u></i> This decree contemplates the malicious burning of public and private structures, regardless of size, not included in Art. 320, as amended by RA 7659, and classified as other cases of arson. These include <b>houses, dwellings, government buildings, farms, mills, plantations, railways, bus stations, airports, wharves and other industrial establishments</b>.[<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>] Although the purpose of the law on Simple Arson is to prevent the high incidence of fires and other crimes involving destruction, protect the national economy and preserve the social, economic and political stability of the nation, PD 1613 tempers the penalty to be meted to offenders. This separate classification of Simple Arson recognizes the need to lessen the severity of punishment commensurate to the act or acts committed, depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. [Emphasis supplied.]<br><br>To emphasize:<br><blockquote>The nature of Destructive Arson is distinguished from Simple Arson by the degree of perversity or viciousness of the criminal offender. The acts committed under Art. 320 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended) constituting Destructive Arson are characterized as heinous crimes for being grievous, odious and hateful offenses and which, by reason of their inherent or manifest wickedness, viciousness, atrocity and perversity are repugnant and outrageous to the common standards and norms of decency and morality in a just, civilized and ordered society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> On the other hand, acts committed under PD 1613 constituting Simple Arson are crimes with a lesser degree of perversity and viciousness that the law punishes with a lesser penalty. In other words, Simple Arson contemplates crimes with less significant social, economic, political and national security implications than Destructive Arson. However, acts falling under Simple Arson may nevertheless be converted into Destructive Arson depending on the qualifying circumstances present. [Emphasis supplied.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Prescinding from the above clarification vis-à-vis the description of the crime as stated in the accusatory portion of the Information, it is quite evident that accused-appellant was charged with the crime of <b><i><u>Simple Arson</u></i></b> - for having <i>"deliberately set fire upon the <b style="text-decoration: underline;">two-storey residential house</b> of ROBERTO SEPARA and family x x x knowing the same to be an inhabited house and situated in a thickly populated place and as a consequence thereof a conflagration ensued and the said building, together with some seven (7) adjoining residential houses, were razed by fire."</i> [Emphasis supplied.]<br><br>The facts of the case at bar is somewhat similar to the facts of the case of <i>People v. Soriano</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>  The accused in the latter case caused the burning of a particular house.  Unfortunately, the blaze spread and gutted down five (5) neighboring houses.  The RTC therein found the accused guilty of destructive arson under paragraph 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of Art. 320 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659.  This Court, through Mr. Justice Bellosillo, however, declared that:<br><blockquote>x x x [T]he applicable provision of law should be Sec. 3, par. 2, of PD 1613, which imposes a penalty of reclusion temporal to reclusion perpetua  for other cases of arson as the properties burned by accused-appellant are <b><i><u>specifically described</u></i></b> as houses, contemplating inhabited houses or dwellings under the aforesaid law. The descriptions as alleged in the second Amended Information particularly refer to the structures as houses rather than as buildings or edifices. The applicable law should therefore be Sec. 3, Par. 2, of PD 1613, and not Art. 320, par. 1 of the Penal Code. In case of ambiguity in construction of penal laws, it is well-settled that such laws shall be construed strictly against the government, and liberally in favor of the accused.<br><br>The elements of arson under Sec. 3, par. 2, of PD 1613 are: (a) there is intentional burning; and (b) what is intentionally burned is an inhabited house or dwelling. Incidentally, these elements concur in the case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote>As stated in the body of the Information, accused-appellant was charged with having intentionally burned the <b><i><u>two-storey residential house</u></i></b> of Robert Separa.

Consequently, if proved, as it was proved, at the trial, she may be convicted, and sentenced accordingly, of the crime of <b><i><u>simple arson</u></i></b>.  Such is the case "notwithstanding the error in the designation of the offense in the information, the information remains effective insofar as it states the facts constituting the crime alleged therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> "What is controlling is not the title of the complaint, nor the designation of the offense charged or the particular law or part thereof allegedly violate, x x x, but the description of the crime charged and the particular facts therein recited."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>There is, thus, a need to modify the penalty imposed by the RTC as Sec. 5 of PD No. 1613 categorically provides that the penalty to be imposed for simple arson is:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Where Death Results from Arson</i>. -  If by reason of or on the occasion of arson death results, the penalty of <b><i><u>reclusion perpetua to death</u></i></b> shall be imposed. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>Accordingly, there being no aggravating circumstance alleged in the Information, the imposable penalty on accused-appellant is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br><i>Apropos</i> the civil liabilities of accused-appellant, current jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> dictate that the civil indemnity due from accused-appellant is P50,000.00 for the death of each of the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>  However, the monetary awards for moral and exemplary damages given by the Court of Appeals, both in the amount of P50,000.00, due the heirs of the victims, have to be <i>deleted</i> for lack of material basis. Similarly, the Court of Appeals award of exemplary damages to Rodolfo Movilla in the amount of P50,000.00 for the destruction of his house, also has to be <i>deleted</i>, but in this instance for being improper.  Moral damages cannot be award by this Court in the absence of proof of mental or physical suffering on the part of the heirs of the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Concerning the award of exemplary damages, the reason for the deletion being that no aggravating circumstance had been alleged and proved by the prosecution in the case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>To summarize, accused-appellant's alternative plea that she be acquitted of the crime must be rejected. With the evidence on record, we find no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the RTC and the Court of Appeals.  It is indubitable that accused-appellant is the author of the crime of simple arson.  All the circumstantial evidence presented before the RTC, viewed in its entirety, is as convincing as direct evidence and, as such, negates accused-appellant's innocence, and when considered concurrently with her admission given to Mercedita Mendoza, the former's guilt beyond reasonable doubt is twice as evident.  Hence, her conviction is effectively justified.  More so, as it is propitious to note that in stark contrast to the factual circumstances presented by the prosecution, accused-appellant neither mustered a denial nor an alibi except for the proposition that her guilt had not been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>IN VIEW WHEREOF, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 2 September 2005, in CA G.R. CR HC No. 01139, is hereby AFFIRMED insofar as the conviction of accused-appellant EDNA MALNGAN Y MAYO is concerned. The sentence to be imposed and the amount of damages to be awarded, however, are MODIFIED. In accordance with Sec. 5 of Presidential Decree No. 1613, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to <i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i>. Accused-appellant is hereby ordered to pay the heirs of each of the victims P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Panganiban, C.
