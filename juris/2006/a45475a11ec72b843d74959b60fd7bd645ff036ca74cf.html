SP No. 75013, which reversed and set aside the Resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), dated 28 March 2001 and 24 September 2002 in NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-11-05252-89.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The Antecedents</span><br></div><br>As culled from the records, respondent Sadac was appointed Vice President of the Legal Department of petitioner Bank effective 1 August 1981, and subsequently General Counsel thereof on 8 December 1981.&nbsp; On 26 June 1989, nine lawyers of petitioner Bank's Legal Department, in a letter-petition to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, accused respondent Sadac of abusive conduct, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, and ultimately, petitioned for a change in leadership of the department.&nbsp; On the ground of lack of confidence in respondent Sadac, under the rules of client and lawyer relationship, petitioner Bank instructed respondent Sadac to deliver all materials in his custody in all cases in which the latter was appearing as its counsel of record.&nbsp; In reaction thereto, respondent Sadac requested for a full hearing and formal investigation but the same remained unheeded.&nbsp; On 9 November 1989, respondent Sadac filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with damages against petitioner Bank and individual members of the Board of Directors thereof.&nbsp; After learning of the filing of the complaint, petitioner Bank terminated the services of respondent Sadac.&nbsp; Finally, on 10 August 1989, respondent Sadac was removed from his office and ordered disentitled to any compensation and other benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated 2 October 1990, Labor Arbiter Jovencio Ll.

National Labor Relations Commission, </span>docketed as G.R. No. 102467.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br>In our Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of 13 June 1997, we held respondent Sadac's dismissal illegal.&nbsp; We said that the existence of the employer-employee relationship between petitioner Bank and respondent Sadac had been duly established bringing the case within the coverage of the Labor Code, hence, we did not permit petitioner Bank to rely on Sec. 26, Rule 138<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the Rules of Court, claiming that the association between the parties was one of a client-lawyer relationship, and, thus, it could terminate at any time the services of respondent Sadac.&nbsp; Moreover, we did not find that respondent Sadac's dismissal was grounded on any of the causes stated in Article 282 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; We similarly found that petitioner Bank disregarded the procedural requirements in terminating respondent Sadac's employment as so required by Section 2 and Section 5, Rule XIV, Book V of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code.&nbsp; We decreed:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the herein questioned Resolution of the NLRC is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS: That private respondent shall be entitled to backwages from termination of employment until turning sixty (60) years of age (in 1995) and, thereupon, to retirement benefits in accordance with law; that private respondent shall be paid an additional amount of P5,000.00; that the award of moral and exemplary damages are <span style="font-style: italic;">deleted</span>; and that the liability herein pronounced shall be due from petitioner bank alone, the other petitioners being <span style="font-style: italic;">absolved</span> from solidary liability.&nbsp; No costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>On 28 July 1997, our Decision in G.R. No. 102467 dated 13 June 1997 became final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br>Pursuant thereto, respondent Sadac filed with the Labor Arbiter a Motion for Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> thereof. Likewise, petitioner Bank filed a Manifestation and Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> praying that the award in favor of respondent Sadac be computed and that after payment is made, petitioner Bank be ordered forever released from liability under said judgment. <br><br>Per respondent Sadac's computation, the total amount of the monetary award is P6,030,456.59, representing his backwages and other benefits, including the general increases which he should have earned during the period of his illegal termination. Respondent Sadac theorized that he started with a monthly compensation of P12,500.00 in August 1981, when he was appointed as Vice President of petitioner Bank's Legal Department and later as its General Counsel in December 1981.&nbsp; As of November 1989, when he was dismissed illegally, his monthly compensation amounted to P29,365.00 or more than twice his original compensation.&nbsp; The difference, he posited, can be attributed to the annual salary increases which he received equivalent to 15 percent (15%) of his monthly salary. <br><br>Respondent Sadac anchored his claim on Article 279 of the Labor Code of the Philippines, and cited as authority the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic Company, Ltd. v. Court of Industrial Relations,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Louis College of Tuguegarao v.

National Labor Relations Commission</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; According to respondent Sadac, the catena of cases uniformly holds that it is the obligation of the employer to pay an illegally dismissed employee the whole amount of the salaries or wages, plus all other benefits and bonuses and general increases to which he would have been normally entitled had he not been dismissed; and therefore, salary increases should be deemed a component in the computation of backwages.&nbsp; Moreover, respondent Sadac contended that his check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leaves must be included in the computation of his backwages.<br><br>Petitioner Bank disputed respondent Sadac's computation.&nbsp; Per its computation, the amount of monetary award due respondent Sadac is P2,981,442.98 only, to the exclusion of the latter's general salary increases and other claimed benefits which, it maintained, were unsubstantiated.&nbsp; The jurisprudential precedent relied upon by petitioner Bank in assailing respondent Sadac's computation is <span style="font-style: italic;">Evangelista v. National Labor Relations Commission</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount Vinyl Products Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> holding that an unqualified award of backwages means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal.&nbsp; Furthermore, petitioner Bank argued before the Labor Arbiter that the award of salary differentials is not allowed, the established rule being that upon reinstatement, illegally dismissed employees are to be paid their backwages without deduction and qualification as to any wage increases or other benefits that may have been received by their co-workers who were not dismissed or did not go on strike.<br><br>On 2 August 1999, Labor Arbiter Jovencio Ll. Mayor, Jr. rendered an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> adopting respondent Sadac's computation.&nbsp; In the main, the Labor Arbiter relying on <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares v. National Labor</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Relations Commission</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> concluded that respondent Sadac is entitled to the general increases as a component in the computation of his backwages.&nbsp; Accordingly, he awarded respondent Sadac the amount of P6,030,456.59 representing his backwages inclusive of allowances and other claimed benefits, namely check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leave plus 12 percent (12%) interest per annum equivalent to P1,367,590.89&nbsp; as of 30 June 1999, or a total of P7,398,047.48.&nbsp; However, considering that respondent Sadac had already received the amount of P1,055,740.48 by virtue of a Writ of Execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> earlier issued on 18 January 1999, the Labor Arbiter directed petitioner Bank to pay respondent Sadac the amount of P6,342,307.00.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter also granted an award of attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of all monetary awards, and imposed a 12 percent (12%) interest per annum reckoned from the finality of the judgment until the satisfaction thereof.<br><br>The Labor Arbiter decreed, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of al (sic) the foregoing, let an "ALIAS" Writ of Execution be issued commanding the Sheriff, this Branch, to collect from respondent Bank the amount of Ph6,342,307.00 representing the backwages with 12% interest per annum due complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner Bank interposed an appeal with the NLRC, which reversed the Labor Arbiter in a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> promulgated on 28 March 2001.&nbsp; It ratiocinated that the doctrine on general increases as component in computing backwages in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sigma Personnel Services </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Louis </span>was merely <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter dictum</span>.&nbsp; The NLRC found <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic Co., Ltd.</span> inapplicable on the ground that the original circumstances therein are not only peculiar to the said case but also completely strange to the case of respondent Sadac.&nbsp; Further, the NLRC disallowed respondent Sadac's claim to check-up benefit ratiocinating that there was no clear and substantial proof that the same was being granted and enjoyed by other employees of petitioner Bank.&nbsp; The award of attorney's fees was similarly deleted.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Resolution states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is considered meritorious and accordingly, the computation prepared by respondent Equitable Banking Corporation on the award of backwages in favor of complainant Ricardo Sadac under the decision promulgated by the Supreme Court on June 13, 1997 in G.R. No. 102476 in the aggregate amount of P2,981,442.98 is hereby ordered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent Sadac's Motion for Reconsideration thereon was denied by the NLRC in its Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> promulgated on 24 September 2002.<br><br>Aggrieved, respondent Sadac filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span> seeking nullification of the twin resolutions of the NLRC, dated 28 March 2001 and 24 September 2002, as well as praying for the reinstatement of the 2 August 1999 Order of the Labor Arbiter.<br><br>For the resolution of the Court of Appeals were the following issues, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>.: <blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">(1)</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Whether periodic general increases in basic salary, check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leave are included in the computation of full backwages for illegally dismissed employees;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(2)</td><td> <div align="justify">Whether respondent is entitled to attorney's fees; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(3)</td><td> <div align="justify">Whether respondent is entitled to twelve percent (12%) per annum as interest on all accounts outstanding until full payment thereof.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>Finding for respondent Sadac (therein petitioner), the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision on 6 April 2004, the dispositive portion of which is quoted hereunder:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the March 28, 2001 and the September 24, 2002 Resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commissions (sic) are REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the August 2, 1999 Order of the Labor Arbiter is REVIVED to the effect that private respondent is DIRECTED TO PAY petitioner the sum of PhP6,342,307.00, representing full back wages (sic) which sum includes annual general increases in basic salary, check-up benefit, clothing allowance, cash conversion of vacation leave and other sundry benefits plus 12% per annum interest on outstanding balance from July 28, 1997 until full payment.<br><br>Costs against private respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals, citing <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic</span> held that respondent Sadac's general increases should be added as part of his backwages. According to the appellate court, respondent Sadac's entitlement to the annual general increases has been duly proven by substantial evidence that the latter, in fact, enjoyed an annual increase of more or less 15 percent (15%).&nbsp; Respondent Sadac's check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leave were similarly ordered added in the computation of respondent Sadac's basic wage.<br><br>Anent the matter of attorney's fees, the Court of Appeals sustained the NLRC.&nbsp; It ruled that our Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of 13 June 1997 did not award attorney's fees in respondent Sadac's favor as there was nothing in the aforesaid Decision, either in the dispositive portion or the body thereof that supported the grant of attorney's fees.&nbsp; Resolving the final issue, the Court of Appeals imposed a 12 percent (12%) interest per annum on the total monetary award to be computed from 28 July 1997 or the date our judgment in G.R. No. 102467 became final and executory until fully paid at which time the quantification of the amount may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained.<br><br>On 7 May 2004, respondent Sadac filed a Partial Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the 6 April 2004 Court of Appeals Decision insofar as the appellate court did not award him attorney's fees. Similarly, petitioner Bank filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration thereon.&nbsp; Following an exchange of pleadings between the parties, the Court of Appeals rendered a Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated 28 July 2004, denying petitioner Bank's Motion for Partial Reconsideration for lack of merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Assignment of Errors</span><br></div><br>Hence, the instant Petition for Review by petitioner Bank on the following assignment of errors, to wit:<br><blockquote>(a) The Hon.

The prevailing rule in the milieu of the <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic </span>doctrine was to deduct earnings earned elsewhere from the amount of backwages payable to an illegally dismissed employee. <br><br>Petitioner Bank posits that even granting that <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic</span> allowed general salary increases in the computation of backwages, it was because the inclusion was purposely to cushion the blow of the deduction of earnings derived elsewhere; with the amendment of Article 279 and the consequent elimination of the rule on the deduction of earnings derived elsewhere, the rationale for including salary increases in the computation of backwages no longer exists.&nbsp; On the references of salary increases in the aforementioned cases of (i) <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Louis</span>; (ii) <span style="font-style: italic;">Sigma Personnel</span>; and (iii) <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span>, petitioner Bank contends that the same were merely <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter dicta</span>. &nbsp;In fine, petitioner Bank anchors its claim on the cases of (i) <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount Vinyl Products Corp. v.

National Labor Relations Commission</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> had the occasion to explicate on the meaning of <span style="font-style: italic;">full backwages</span> as contemplated by Article 279<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Labor Code of the Philippines</span>, as amended by Section 34 of Rep. Act No. 6715.&nbsp; The Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante</span> said, thus:<br><blockquote>The Court deems it appropriate, however, to reconsider such earlier ruling on the computation of backwages as enunciated in said Pines City Educational Center case, by now holding that conformably with the evident legislative intent as expressed in Rep. Act No. 6715, above-quoted, backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee, should not, as a general rule, be diminished or reduced by the earnings derived by him elsewhere during the period of his illegal dismissal.&nbsp; The underlying reason for this ruling is that the employee, while litigating the legality (illegality) of his dismissal, must still earn a living to support himself and family, while full backwages have to be paid by the employer as part of the price or penalty he has to pay for illegally dismissing his employee.&nbsp; The clear legislative intent of the amendment in Rep. Act No. 6715 is to give more benefits to workers than was previously given them under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug</span> rule or the "deduction of earnings elsewhere" rule.&nbsp; Thus, a closer adherence to the legislative policy behind Rep. Act No. 6715 points to "full backwages" as meaning exactly that, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </span>without deducting from backwages the earnings derived elsewhere by the concerned employee during the period of his illegal dismissal.&nbsp; In other words, the provision calling for "full backwages" to illegally dismissed employees is clear, plain and free from ambiguity and, therefore, must be applied without attempted or strained interpretation.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Index animi sermo est.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Verily, jurisprudence has shown that the definition of full backwages has forcefully evolved.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the rule was that backwages were granted for a period of three years without qualification and without deduction, meaning, the award of backwages was not reduced by earnings actually earned by the dismissed employee during the interim period of the separation.

National Labor Relations Commission,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> &nbsp;where we allowed the recovery of backwages for the duration of the illegal dismissal minus the total amount of earnings which the employee derived elsewhere from the date of dismissal up to the date of reinstatement, if any. &nbsp;In <span style="font-style: italic;">Ferrer </span>and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pines</span>, the three-year period was deleted, and instead, the dismissed employee was paid backwages for the <span style="font-style: italic;">entire period</span> that he was without work subject to the deductions, as mentioned. &nbsp;Finally came our ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante</span> which superseded <span style="font-style: italic;">Pines City Educational Center </span>and allowed <span style="font-style: italic;">full </span>recovery of backwages without deduction and without qualification pursuant to the express provisions of Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 6715, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e., </span>without any deduction of income the employee may have derived from employment elsewhere from the date of his dismissal up to his reinstatement, that is, covering the entirety of the period of the dismissal.<br><br>The first issue for our resolution involves another aspect in the computation of full backwages, mainly, the basis of the computation thereof. Otherwise stated, whether general salary increases should be included in the base figure to be used in the computation of backwages. <br><br>In so concluding that general salary increases should be made a component in the computation of backwages, the Court of Appeals ratiocinated, thus:<br><blockquote>The Supreme Court held in <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic, Ltd. v. Court of Industrial Relations, 40 SCRA 521 (1971)</span> that "general increases" should be added as a part of full backwages, <span style="font-style: italic;">to wit:</span><br><blockquote>In other words, the just and equitable rule regarding the point under discussion is this: <span style="font-style: italic;">It is the obligation of the employer to pay an illegally dismissed employee or worker the whole amount of the salaries or wages, plus all other benefits and bonuses and general increases, to which he would have been normally entitled had he not been dismissed</span> and had not stopped working, but it is the right, on the other hand of the employer to deduct from the total of these, the amount equivalent to the salaries or wages the employee or worker would have earned in his old employment on the corresponding days he was actually gainfully employed elsewhere with an equal or higher salary or wage, such that if his salary or wage in his other employment was less, the employer may deduct only what has been actually earned.<br></blockquote>The doctrine in East Asiatic was subsequently reiterated, in the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Louis College of Tugueg[a]rao v. NLRC, 177 SCRA&nbsp; 151 (1989)</span>; <span style="font-style: italic;">Sigma Personnel Services v. NLRC, 224 SCRA 181 (1993)</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares v. National Labor Relations Commission, 305 SCRA 500 (1999)</span>.<br><br>Private respondent, in opposing the petitioner's contention, alleged in his Memorandum that only the wage rate at the time of the employee's illegal dismissal should be considered - private respondent citing the following decisions of the Supreme Court: <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount Vinyl Corp. v. NLRC 190 SCRA 525 (1990); Evangelista v. NLRC, 249 SCRA 194 (1995); Espejo v.

NLRC 268 SCRA 497 (1997) </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante v. NLRC and Evergreen Farms, Inc. 265 SCRA 61 (1996) </span>the Supreme Court held that the clear legislative intent in the amendment in Republic Act 6715 was to give <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">more</span> benefits to workers than was previously given them under the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug</span> rule or the "deductions of earnings elsewhere" rule.<br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount Vinyl, Evangelista, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Espejo </span>cases cited by private respondent are inapplicable to the case at bar. The doctrines therein came about as a result of the old <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug </span>rule, which was repealed with the passage of Republic Act 6715 into law.&nbsp; It was in <span style="font-style: italic;">Alex Ferrer v. NLRC 255 SCRA 430 (1993) </span>when the Supreme Court returned to the doctrine in <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic</span>, which was soon supplanted by the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante v. NLRC and Evergreen Farms, Inc., </span>which held that the backwages to be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee, should not, as a general rule, be diminished or reduced by the earnings derived from him during the period of his illegal dismissal.&nbsp; Furthermore, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug </span>rule was never meant to prejudice the workers, but merely to speed the recovery of their backwages.<br><br>Ever since <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug Co. Inc. v. CIR 56 SCRA 694 (1974)</span>, it had been the intent of the Supreme Court to increase the backwages due an illegally dismissed employee.&nbsp; In the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mercury Drug </span>case, full backwages was to be recovered even though a three-year limitation on recovery of full backwages was imposed in the name of equity.&nbsp; Then in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante</span>, full backwages was interpreted to mean absolutely no deductions regardless of the duration of the illegal dismissal.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Bustamante</span>, the Supreme Court no longer regarded equity as a basis when dealing with illegal dismissal cases because it is not equity at play in illegal dismissals but rather, it is employer's obligation to pay full back wages (sic).&nbsp; It is an obligation of the employer because it is "the price or penalty the employer has to pay for illegally dismissing his employee."<br><br>The applicable modern definition of full backwages is now found in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares v. National Labor Relations Commission 305 SCRA 500 (1999)</span>, where although the issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span> concerned separation pay - separation pay and backwages both have employee's wage rate at their foundation.<br><blockquote>x x x &nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale is not difficult to discern.&nbsp; It is&nbsp; the obligation of the employer to pay an illegally dismissed employee the whole amount of his salaries plus all other benefits, bonuses and general increases to which he would have been normally entitled had he not been dismissed and had not stopped working.&nbsp; The <span style="font-style: italic;">same holds true </span>in case of <span style="font-style: italic;">retrenched employees.</span> &nbsp;x x x</blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x x<br><br>x x x&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Annual general increases are akin to "allowances" or "other benefits."</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Italics ours.)<br></blockquote>We do not agree.<br><br>Attention must be called to Article 279 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Labor Code of the Philippines</span>, as amended by Section 34 of Rep. Act No. 6715.&nbsp; The law provides as follows:<br><blockquote>ART. 279.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Security of Tenure</span>. - In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title.&nbsp; An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges <span style="font-style: italic;">and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.</span>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Article 279 mandates that an employee's full backwages shall be inclusive of <span style="font-style: italic;">allowances </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">other benefits </span>or their monetary equivalent.&nbsp; Contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals, we do not see that a salary increase can be interpreted as either an <span style="font-style: italic;">allowance </span>or a <span style="font-style: italic;">benefit</span>.&nbsp; Salary increases are not akin to allowances or benefits, and cannot be confused with either.&nbsp; The term "allowances" is sometimes used synonymously with "emoluments," as indirect or contingent remuneration, which may or may not be earned, but which is sometimes in the nature of compensation, and sometimes in the nature of reimbursement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Allowances and benefits are granted to the employee apart or separate from, and in addition to the wage or salary.&nbsp; In contrast, salary increases are amounts which are added to the employee's salary as an increment thereto for varied reasons deemed appropriate by the employer.&nbsp; Salary increases are not separate grants by themselves but once granted, they are deemed part of the employee's salary.&nbsp; To extend the coverage of an allowance or a benefit to include salary increases would be to strain both the imagination of the Court and the language of law.&nbsp; As aptly observed by the NLRC, "to otherwise give the meaning other than what the law speaks for by itself, will open the floodgates to various interpretations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, if the intent were to include salary increases as basis in the computation of backwages, the same should have been explicitly stated in the same manner that the law used clear and unambiguous terms in expressly providing for the inclusion of <span style="font-style: italic;">allowances </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">other benefits.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>Moreover, we find <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic</span> inapplicable to the case at bar.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic, </span>therein petitioner East Asiatic Company, Ltd. was found guilty of unfair labor practices against therein respondent, Soledad A. Dizon, and the Court ordered her reinstatement with back pay.&nbsp; On the question of the amount of backwages, the Court granted the dismissed employee the whole amount of the salaries plus all general increases and bonuses she would have received during the period of her lay-off with the corresponding right of the employer to deduct from the total amounts, all the earnings earned by the employee during her lay-off.&nbsp; The emphasis in <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic </span>is the &nbsp;duty of both the employer and the employee to disclose the material facts&nbsp; and competent evidence within their peculiar knowledge relative to the proper determination of backwages, especially as the earnings derived by the employee elsewhere are deductions to which the employer are entitled.&nbsp; However, <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic </span>does not find relevance in the resolution of the issue before us.&nbsp; First, the material date to consider is 21 March 1989, when the law amending Article 279 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Labor Code, </span>Rep. Act No. 6715, otherwise known as &nbsp;the Herrera-Veloso Law, took effect.&nbsp; It is obvious that the backdrop of <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic, </span>decided by this Court on 31 August 1971 was prior to the current state of the law on the definition of <span style="font-style: italic;">full backwages.</span>&nbsp; Second, it bears stressing that <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic </span>was decided at a time when even as an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to the whole amount of the salaries or wages, it was the recognized right of the employer to deduct from the total of these, the amount equivalent to the salaries or wages the employee or worker would have earned in his old employment on the corresponding days that he was actually gainfully employed elsewhere with an equal or higher salary or wage, such that if his salary or wage in his other employment was less, the employer may deduct only what has been actually earned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; It is for this reason the Court centered its discussion on the duty of both parties to be candid and open about facts within their knowledge to establish the amount of the deductions, and not leave the burden on the employee alone to establish his claim, as well as on the duty of the court to compel the parties to cooperate in disclosing such material facts.&nbsp; The inapplicability of <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic </span>to respondent Sadac was sufficiently elucidated upon by the NLRC, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>.:<br><blockquote>A full discernment of the pertinent portion of the judgment sought to be executed in East Asiatic Co., Ltd. would reveal as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x to reinstate Soledad A. Dizon immediately to her former position with backwages from September 1, 1958 until actually reinstated with all the rights and privileges acquired and due her, including seniority and such other terms and conditions of employment AT THE TIME OF HER LAY-OFF"<br></blockquote>The basis on which this doctrine was laid out was summed up by the Supreme Court which ratiocinated in this light.&nbsp; To quote:<br><blockquote>"x x x on the other hand, of the employer to deduct from the total of these, the amount equivalent to these salaries or wages the employee or worker would have earned in his old employment on the corresponding days that he was actually gainfully employed elsewhere with an equal or higher salary or wage, such that if his salary or wage in his other employment was less, the employer may deduct only what has been actually earned x x x" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Ibid</span>, pp. 547-548).<br></blockquote>But the Supreme Court, in the instant case, pronounced a clear but different judgment from that of East Asiatic Co. decretal portion, in this wise:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the herein questioned Resolution of the NLRC is AFFIRMED with the following MODIFICATIONS: that private respondent shall be entitled to backwages from termination of employment until turning sixty (60) years of age (in 1995) and, thereupon, to retirement benefits in accordance with law; xxx"<br></blockquote>Undisputably (sic), it was decreed in plain and unambiguous language that complainant Sadac "shall be entitled to backwages."&nbsp; No more, no less.<br><br>Thus, this decree for Sadac cannot be considered in any way, substantially in essence, with the award of backwages as pronounced for Ms. Dizon in the case of East Asiatic Co. Ltd.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>In the same vein, we cannot accept the Court of Appeals' reliance on the doctrine as espoused in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span>.&nbsp; It is evident that <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span> concerns itself with the computation of the salary base used in computing the <span style="font-style: italic;">separation pay </span>of petitioners therein. The distinction between backwages and separation pay is elementary.&nbsp; Separation pay is granted where reinstatement is no longer advisable because of strained relations between the employee and the employer. Backwages represent compensation that should have been earned but were not collected because of the unjust dismissal.&nbsp; The bases for computing the two are different, the first being usually the length of the employee's service and the second the actual period when he was unlawfully prevented from working.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The issue that confronted the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span> was whether petitioners' housing and transportation allowances therein which they allegedly received on a monthly basis during their employment should have been included in the computation of their separation pay.&nbsp; It is plain to see that the reference to general increases in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span> citing <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic</span> was a mere <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter.</span>&nbsp; The crux in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares </span>was our pronouncement that the receipt of an allowance on a monthly basis does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto </span>characterize it as regular and forming part of salary because the nature of the grant is a factor worth considering.&nbsp; Whether salary increases are deemed part of the salary base in the computation of backwages was not the issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Millares</span>.<br><br>Neither can we look at <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Louis of Tuguegarao </span>to resolve the instant controversy.&nbsp; What was mainly contentious therein was the inclusion of fringe benefits in the computation of the award of backwages, in particular additional vacation and sick leaves granted to therein concerned employees, it evidently appearing that the reference to <span style="font-style: italic;">East Asiatic </span>in a footnote was a mere <span style="font-style: italic;">obiter dictum. &nbsp;</span>Salary increases are not akin to fringe benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and neither is it logical to conceive of both as belonging to the same taxonomy. <br><br>We must also resolve against the applicability of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sigma Personnel Services </span>to the case at bar.&nbsp; The basic issue before the Court therein was whether the employee, Susan Sumatre, a domestic helper in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, had been illegally dismissed, in light of the contention of Sigma Personnel Services, a duly licensed recruitment agency, that the former was a mere probationary employee who was, on top of this status, mentally unsound.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Even a cursory reading of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sigma Personnel Services </span>citing <span style="font-style: italic;">St. Louis College of Tuguegarao </span>would readily show that inclusion of salary increases in the computation of backwages was not at issue.&nbsp; The same was not on all fours with the instant petition.<br><br>What, then, is the basis of computation of backwages?&nbsp; Are annual general increases in basic salary deemed component in the computation of full backwages?&nbsp; The weight of authority leans in petitioner Bank's favor and against respondent Sadac's claim for the inclusion of general increases in the computation of his backwages. <br><br>We stressed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount </span>that an unqualified award of backwages means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal, thus:<br><blockquote>The determination of the salary base for the computation of backwages requires simply an application of judicial precedents defining the term "backwages". Unfortunately, the Labor Arbiter erred in this regard. <span style="font-style: italic;">An unqualified award of backwages means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal </span>[Davao Free Worker Front v. Court of Industrial Relations, G.R. No. L-29356, October 27, 1975, 67 SCRA 418; Capital Garments Corporation v. Ople, G.R.

And the Court has declared that the base figure to be used in the computation of backwages due to the employee should include not just the basic salary, but also the regular allowances that he had been receiving, such as the emergency living allowances and the 13th month pay mandated under the law [<span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> Pan-Philippine Life Insurance Corporation v. NLRC, G.R. No. 53721, June 29, 1982, 144 SCRA 866; Santos v. NLRC, G.R. No. 76721, September 21, 1987, 154 SCRA 166; Soriano v. NLRC, G.R.

National Labor Relations Commission,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we addressed the sole issue of whether the computation of the award of backwages should be based on current wage level or the wage levels at the time of the dismissal.&nbsp; We resolved that an unqualified award of backwages means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal, thus:<br><blockquote>As explicitly declared in <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount Vinyl Products Corp. vs. NLRC</span>, the determination of the salary base for the computation of backwages requires simply an application of judicial precedents defining the term "backwages."&nbsp; An unqualified award of backwages means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal.&nbsp; Furthermore, the award of salary differentials is not allowed, the established rule being that upon reinstatement, illegally dismissed employees are to be paid their backwages without deduction and qualification as to any wage increases or other benefits that may have been received by their co-workers who were not dismissed or did not go on strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>The case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount </span>was relied upon by the Court in the latter case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Espejo v. National Labor Relations Commission,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> where we reiterated that the computation of backwages should be based on the basic salary at the time of the employee's dismissal plus the regular allowances that he had been receiving.&nbsp; Further, the clarification made by the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">General Baptist Bible College v. National Labor Relations Commission,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> settles the issue, thus:<br><blockquote>We also want to clarify that when there is an award of backwages this actually refers to backwages without qualifications and deductions.&nbsp; Thus, We held that:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"The term 'backwages without qualification and deduction' means that the workers are to be paid their backwages fixed as of the time of the dismissal or strike without deduction for their earnings elsewhere during their layoff and without qualification of their wages as thus fixed; i.e., unqualified by any wage increases </span>or other benefits that may have been received by their co-workers who are not dismissed or did not go on strike.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Awards including salary differentials are not allowed</span>.&nbsp; The salary base properly used should, however, include not only the basic salary but also the emergency cost of living allowances and also transportation allowances if the workers are entitled thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Indeed, even a cursory reading of the dispositive portion of the Court's Decision of 13 June 1997 in G.R. No. 102467, awarding backwages to respondent Sadac, readily shows that the award of backwages therein is unqualified, ergo, without qualification of the wage as thus fixed at the time of the dismissal and without deduction.<br><br>A demarcation line between salary increases and backwages was drawn by the Court in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Paguio v. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., Inc.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; where therein petitioner Paguio, on account of his illegal transfer sought backwages, including an amount equal to 16 percent (16%) of his monthly salary representing his salary increases during the period of his demotion, contending that he had been consistently granted salary increases because of his above average or outstanding performance. We said:<br><blockquote>In several cases, the Court had the opportunity to elucidate on the reason for the grant of backwages.&nbsp; Backwages are granted on grounds of equity to workers for earnings lost due to their illegal dismissal from work. They are a reparation for the illegal dismissal of an employee based on earnings which the employee would have obtained, either by virtue of a lawful decree or order, as in the case of a wage increase under a wage order, or by rightful expectation, as in the case of one's salary or wage. The outstanding feature of backwages is thus the degree of assuredness to an employee that he would have had them as earnings had he not been illegally terminated from his employment.<br><br>Petitioner's claim, however, is based simply on expectancy or his assumption that, because in the past he had been consistently rated for his outstanding performance and his salary correspondingly increased, it is probable that he would similarly have been given high ratings and salary increases but for his transfer to another position in the company.<br><br>In contrast to a grant of backwages or an award of <span style="font-style: italic;">lucrum cessans</span> in the civil law, this contention is based merely on speculation. Furthermore, it assumes that in the other position to which he had been transferred petitioner had not been given any performance evaluation.&nbsp; As held by the Court of Appeals, however, the mere fact that petitioner had been previously granted salary increases by reason of his excellent performance does not necessarily guarantee that he would have performed in the same manner and, therefore, qualify for the said increase later.&nbsp; What is more, his claim is tantamount to saying that he had a vested right to remain as Head of the Garnet Exchange and given salary increases simply because he had performed well in such position, and thus he should not be moved to any other position where management would require his services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>Applying <span style="font-style: italic;">Paguio </span>to the case at bar, we are not prepared to accept that this degree of assuredness applies to respondent Sadac's salary increases.&nbsp; There was no lawful decree or order supporting his claim, such that his salary increases can be made a component in the computation of backwages.&nbsp; What is evident is that salary increases are a mere expectancy.&nbsp; They are, by its nature volatile and are dependent on numerous variables, including the company's fiscal situation and even the employee's future performance on the job, or the employee's continued stay in a position subject to management prerogative to transfer him to another position where his services are needed.&nbsp; In short, there is no vested right to salary increases.&nbsp; That respondent Sadac may have received salary increases in the past only proves fact of receipt but does not establish a degree of assuredness that is inherent in backwages.&nbsp; From the foregoing, the plain conclusion is that respondent Sadac's computation of his full backwages which includes his prospective salary increases cannot be permitted.<br><br>Respondent Sadac cannot take exception by arguing that jurisprudence speaks only of <span style="font-style: italic;">wage</span> and not <span style="font-style: italic;">salary</span>, and therefore, the rule is inapplicable to him. &nbsp;It is respondent Sadac's stance that he was not paid at the wage rate nor was he engaged in some form of manual or physical labor as he was hired as Vice President of petitioner Bank.&nbsp; He cites <span style="font-style: italic;">Gaa v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> where the Court distinguished between wage and salary.<br><br>The reliance is misplaced. The distinction between <span style="font-style: italic;">salary </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">wage </span>in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gaa</span> was for the purpose of Article 1708 of the Civil Code which mandates that, "[t]he laborer's wage shall not be subject to execution or attachment, except for debts incurred for food, shelter, clothing and medical attendance."&nbsp; In labor law, however, the distinction appears to be merely semantics.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Paramount </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Evangelista </span>may have involved wage earners, but the petitioner in <span style="font-style: italic;">Espejo </span>was a General Manager with a monthly salary of P9,000.00 plus privileges.

"Salary," the etymology of which is the Latin word "salarium," is often used interchangeably with "wage", the etymology of which is the Middle English word "wagen".&nbsp; Both words generally refer to one and the same meaning, that is, a reward or recompense for services performed.&nbsp; Likewise, "pay" is the synonym of "wages" and "salary" (Black's Law Dictionary, 5<sup>th</sup> Ed). x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> &nbsp;(Italics supplied.)</blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>Petitioner Bank ascribes as its second assignment of error the Court of Appeals' ruling that respondent Sadac is entitled to check-up benefit, clothing allowance and cash conversion of vacation leaves notwithstanding that respondent Sadac did not present any evidence to prove entitlement to these claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> <br><br>The determination of respondent Sadac's entitlement to check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leaves involves a question of fact.&nbsp; The well-entrenched rule is that only errors of law not of facts are reviewable by this Court in a petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>&nbsp; The jurisdiction of this Court in a petition for review on <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings being assailed are not supported by evidence on record or the impugned judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; This Court is also not precluded from delving into and resolving issues of facts, particularly if the findings of the Labor Arbiter are inconsistent with those of the NLRC and the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>&nbsp; Such is the case in the instant petition. The Labor Arbiter and the Court of Appeals are in agreement anent the entitlement of respondent Sadac to check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leaves, but the findings of the NLRC were to the contrary.&nbsp; The Labor Arbiter sustained respondent Sadac's entitlement to check-up benefit, clothing allowance and cash conversion of vacation leaves.&nbsp; He gave weight to petitioner Bank's acknowledgment in its computation that respondent Sadac is entitled to certain benefits, namely, rice subsidy, tuition fee allowance, and medicine allowance, thus, there exists no reason to deprive respondent Sadac of his other benefits. The Labor Arbiter also reasoned that the petitioner Bank did not adduce evidence to support its claim that the benefits sought by respondent Sadac are not granted to its employees and officers.&nbsp; Similarly, the Court of Appeals ratiocinated that if ordinary employees are entitled to receive these benefits, so it is with more reason for a Vice President, like herein respondent Sadac to receive the same.<br><br>We find in the records that, per petitioner Bank's computation, the benefits to be received by respondent are monthly rice subsidy, tuition fee allowance per year, and medicine allowance per year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; Contained nowhere is an acknowledgment of herein claimed benefits, namely, check-up benefit, clothing allowance, and cash conversion of vacation leaves.&nbsp; We cannot sustain the rationalization that the acknowledgment by petitioner Bank in its computation of certain benefits granted to respondent Sadac means that the latter is also entitled to the other benefits as claimed by him but not acknowledged by petitioner Bank.&nbsp; The rule is, he who alleges, not he who denies, must prove. Mere allegations by respondent Sadac does not suffice in the absence of proof supporting the same.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>We come to the third assignment of error raised by petitioner Bank in its Supplement to Petition for Review, assailing the 26 October 2004 Supplemental Decision of the Court of Appeals which amended the <span style="font-style: italic;">fallo</span> of its 6 April 2004 Decision to include "attorney's fees equal to TEN PERCENT (10%) of all the monetary award" granted to respondent Sadac.&nbsp; Petitioner Bank posits that neither the dispositive portion of our 13 June 1997 Decision in G.R. No. 102467 nor the body thereof awards attorney's fees to respondent Sadac.&nbsp; It is postulated that the body of the 13 June 1997 Decision does not contain any findings of facts or conclusions of law relating to attorney's fees, thus, this Court did not intend to grant to respondent Sadac the same, especially in the light of its finding that the petitioner Bank was not motivated by malice or bad faith and that it did not act in a wanton, oppressive, or malevolent manner in terminating the services of respondent Sadac.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>At the outset it must be emphasized that when a final judgment becomes executory, it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable.&nbsp; The judgment may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the Court rendering it or by the highest Court of the land.&nbsp; The only recognized exceptions are the correction of clerical errors or the making of so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">nunc pro tunc </span>entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and, of course, where the judgment is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; The Court's 13 June 1997 Decision in G.R.

In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.<br><br></li><li>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Article 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br></li><li>When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>It is obvious that the legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum shall be imposed from the time judgment becomes final and executory, until full satisfaction thereof.&nbsp; Therefore, petitioner Bank is liable to pay interest from 28 July 1997, the finality of our Decision in &nbsp;G.R.
