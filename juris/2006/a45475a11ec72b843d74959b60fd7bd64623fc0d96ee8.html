Respondents Alfredo L. Lanza, Rolando T. Rodolfo, and Renato P. Villanueva alleged that they were deliverymen at the time of their dismissal and not CRE or casual rotation employee. For his part, respondent Brendo S. Poquiz alleged that a certain Salvador Refruto had already occupied his former position. Respondents filed a motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> for contempt against AWU and MPSI for non-compliance  with the partial writ of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Respondents also prayed for additional backwages because they were allegedly not reinstated to their former positions or to equivalent positions.<br><br>On 28 August 1997, Labor Arbiter Geobel A. Bartolabac ("Labor Arbiter Bartolabac") issued an order, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered denying backwages to complainants Lanza, Rodolfo and Villanueva.<br><br>Be that as it may, respondent Marina Port Services, Inc. (Now Asian Terminals, Inc.) is ordered to admit Lanza, Rodolfo and Villanueva back to work.<br><br>Moreover, respondent Marina Port Services, Inc. (Now Asian Terminals, Inc.) is ordered to reinstate and pay complainant Brendo Poquiz his backwages, computed as of even date as follows:<br><br>P3,800 x 20 mos.   =   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">P76,000.00</span><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Labor Arbiter Bartolabac held that it was proper for MPSI to reinstate respondents Alfredo L. Lanza, Rolando T. Rodolfo, and Renato P. Villanueva  to their former positions as CRE-120, CRE-370 and CRE-412, respectively. However, Labor Arbiter Bartolabac found that on respondent Brendo S. Poquiz, MPSI failed to prove that his position was still available or that MPSI offered him a substantially equivalent position. Thus, Labor Arbiter Bartolabac granted additional backwages to respondent Brendo S. Poquiz but denied the same to respondents Alfredo L. Lanza, Rolando T. Rodolfo, and Renato P. Villanueva.<br><br>MPSI appealed Labor Arbiter Bartolabac's Order to the NLRC. On 30 January 1998, the NLRC modified the order of  Labor Arbiter Bartolabac by deleting the award of additional backwages in favor of respondent  Brendo S. Poquiz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The NLRC held that MPSI had reclassified the positions of deliveryman and day worker vessel as casual rotation employee (CRE) and dockworker vessel (DWV), respectively.  The NLRC upheld the MPSI management's prerogative of  streamlining its organizational set-up which resulted in the reclassification of positions. Thus, the NLRC ruled that MPSI had properly reinstated respondents to substantially equivalent positions and that respondents are no longer entitled to the award of additional backwages.<br><br>Respondents filed a petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals. On 17 February 2000, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED. The assailed NLRC decision, having been issued with grave abuse of discretion, is SET ASIDE. Respondent Asian Terminals, Inc. is ordered to reinstate the above named petitioners to positions substantially equivalent to their previous positions without loss of seniority rights, other privileges and benefits, and full backwages. No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this petition.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>The Court of Appeals held that at the time of respondents' illegal dismissal,  respondents  were  already   regular   employees considering their<br><br>length of service in the MPSI. Citing Article 280<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the Labor Code, the Court of Appeals held that as long as the employee has rendered at least one year of service, he becomes a regular employee for the activity in which he is employed. Thus, if the positions previously held by respondents have already been abolished, then respondents should be reinstated to substantially equivalent positions.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issue</span><br></div><br>The sole issue for resolution is whether MPSI reinstated respondents to their former or equivalent positions.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Court</span><br></div><br>We find the petition meritorious.<br><br>In this case, the decision dated 27 December 1995 of Labor Arbiter Dinopol ordered the reinstatement of respondents to their former or equivalent positions  and the payment of backwages to respondents from the time of their illegal dismissal up to the time of their reinstatement. The NLRC affirmed the decision which became final and executory. The present controversy arose when respondents filed motions and prayed for additional backwages, alleging that MPSI did not reinstate them to their former or equivalent positions.<br><br>Reinstatement means restoration to a state or condition from which one had been removed or separated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The person reinstated assumes the position he had occupied prior to his dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Reinstatement presupposes that the previous position from which one had been removed still exists, or that there is an unfilled position which is substantially equivalent or of similar nature as the one previously occupied by the employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>MPSI asserts that it reinstated respondents to their former positions. According to MPSI, respondents were regular employees and that their designation as casual rotation employees merely meant that they work on rotation.<br><br>The NLRC found that MPSI indeed reinstated respondents to their former positions or to substantially equivalent positions.  The records of the case support this finding.  Factual findings of labor officials, who possess the expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded  great weight  if substantial evidence support the findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>MPSI reinstated respondents on 26 February 1996 to the following positions:<br><br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td width="42%">1.

There is no evidence showing that the position of deliveryman is the same as reserved deliveryman. Furthermore, respondents Alfredo L. Lanza, Rolando T. Rodolfo, and Renato P. Villanueva failed to prove that they were already occupying the position of deliveryman at the time of their dismissal. For his part, respondent Brendo S.
