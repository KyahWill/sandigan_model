Pascual, the motion is GRANTED.  Consequently, said accused is given a period of fifteen (15) days from today within which to file his expanded motion or supplemental motion for reconsideration in the Office of the Special Prosecutor which is directed to inform this Court of the action it has taken thereon within thirty (30) days from receipt of the adverted motion.<br></blockquote>Accordingly, on February 19, 2002, Antalan filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration with the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  Pending resolution of his Motion, Antalan  filed with this Court, on March 11, 2002, the present Petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">Certiorari</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where he reiterates that the October 1, 2001 Memorandum and October 4, 2001 Information were issued in violation of  his constitutional right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> respondent, through the Solicitor General, argues that the Petition has been rendered moot by petitioner's filing a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration with the OSP where he also questioned the validity of the October 1, 2001 Memorandum and October 4, 2001 Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  Respondent points out that petitioner virtually engaged in forum shopping when he took both recourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Subsequent events rendered this petition moot and academic.<br><br>It was only on September 11, 2006 that the records of Criminal Case No. 27128 was elevated to this Court.<br><br>The records reveal that proceedings in said case has taken the following course:<br><br>First, acting on petitioner's Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ombudsman</span> Prosecutor III Victor A.

Meanwhile, complainants in Criminal Case No. 27128 filed with OSP a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> from the August 12, 2002 OSP Resolution; and with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sandiganbayan</span>, an Opposition (to Motion to Withdraw Information) with Manifestation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Second, in a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated February 14, 2003, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ombudsman</span> convened a panel to act on complainant's Motion for Reconsideration.

It is quite plain that, through the January 7, 2003 <span style="font-style: italic;">Sandiganbayan</span> Resolution, petitioner has already obtained all the reliefs initially sought from this Court.
