Opportunity to exercise those rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation. After such warnings have been given, such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer or make a statement. But unless and until such warnings and waivers are demonstrated by the prosecution at the trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.<br></blockquote>The objective is to prohibit "incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in self-incriminating statement without full warnings of constitutional rights."<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The rights above specified, to repeat, exist only in "custodial interrogations," or "in-custody interrogation of accused persons."

But if he should opt to do so, in his defense to the accusation against him, it would be absurd to reject his statements, whether at the administrative investigation, or at a subsequent criminal action brought against him, because he had not been accorded, prior to his making and presenting them, his "Miranda rights" (to silence and to counsel and to be informed thereof, etc) which, to repeat, are relevant in custodial investigations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">People v.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals did not thus err in pronouncing that petitioners were not under custodial investigation to call for the presence of counsel of their own choice, hence, their written incriminatory statements are admissible in evidence.<br><br>The extra-judicial confession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> before the police of Flormarie (who, as earlier stated, has remained at large) in which she incriminated petitioners bears a different complexion, however, as it was made under custodial investigation.  When she gave the statement, the investigation was no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but had begun to focus on a particular suspect.  The records show that Camilo had priorly reported the thievery to the same police authorities and identified Flormarie and Benitez as initial suspects.<br><blockquote>It is always incumbent upon the prosecution to prove at the trial that prior to in-custody questioning, the confessant was informed of his constitutional rights. The presumption of regularity of official acts does not prevail over the constitutional presumption of innocence.  Hence, in the absence of proof that the arresting officers complied with these constitutional safeguards, extrajudicial statements, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, made during custodial investigation are inadmissible and cannot be considered in the adjudication of a case.  In other words, confessions and admissions in violation of Section 12 (1), Article III of the Constitution are <span style="font-weight: bold;">inadmissible</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">evidence</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">against</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">the</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">declarant</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">more</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">so</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">against</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">third</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">persons</span>. This is so even if such statements are gospel truth and voluntarily given.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners at all events argue that their written statements were obtained through deceit, promise, trickery and scheme, they claiming that Lily dictated to them their contents.  There is nothing on record, however, buttressing petitioners' claim other than their self-serving assertion.  The presumption that no person of normal mind would deliberately and knowingly confess to a crime unless prompted by truth and conscience<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> such that it is presumed to be voluntary until the contrary is proved thus stands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The circumstances surrounding the execution of the written admissions likewise militate against petitioners' bare claim.  Petitioners admittedly wrote their respective letters during office hours in Lily's office which was located in the same open booth or counter occupied by the cashier and credit card in-charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>   And this Court takes note of the observation of the trial court that petitioners' written notes were "neatly written in Tagalog, and not in broken Tagalog as spoken by Lily Ong".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In another vein, Rosario labels her written statement as a mere "apology for breach of procedure".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>  Her resort to semantics deserves scant consideration, however.

It is an acknowledgment of some facts or circumstances which, in itself, is insufficient to authorize a conviction and which tends only to establish the ultimate facts of guilt.

The tampered invoices presented by the prosecution which glaringly show the variance in the amounts corroborate Rita's claim.<br><br>Rosario contends, however, that there was no "unlawful taking" since the amounts of "short-over" did not belong to Western.  The argument does not lie.  The "excess" sums formed part of the selling price and were paid to, and received by, Western.  The discrepancy in the amounts came about on account of the alteration in the copies of the invoices which should have faithfully reflected the same amount paid by the customer.<br><br>As for petitioners' claim of entitlement to the "excess" amounts as salespersons' commission, it was not established in evidence.<br><br>Even assuming that the "short-over" was intended to defray sundry expenses, it was not incumbent upon the salespersons to claim them and automatically apply them to the miscellaneous charges.  It was beyond the nature of their functions.  The utilization of the "short-over" was not left to the discretion of the salespersons.  The element of unlawful taking was thus established.<br><br>A further review of the nature of petitioners' functions shows, however, that the element of grave abuse of confidence is wanting in the case.<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="5%"> <div align="justify">:</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">As an accountant employee since June 1995, Mr. Witness, you are familiar that in the procedure in any particular branch of Western Marketing Corporation, are you aware if somebody buys an item from one store, do you know the flow of this sale?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">In fact, in the store there are employees which are assigned with specific duties or functions, is it not?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Like for instance, let's take the case of Filipina Orellana.

Mere breach of trust is not enough.

The same rule applies if the extrajudicial confession is made by one accused after the conspiracy has ceased. However, if the declarant/admitter repeats in court his extrajudicial confession during trial and the other accused is accorded the opportunity to cross-examine the admitter, such confession or admission is admissible against both accused.
