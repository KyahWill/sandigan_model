				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO MORALES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By two separate complaints filed with the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), Elsa L. Mondejar (complainant) sought the disbarment of Atty. Vivian G. Rubia (respondent) and the cancellation of her notarial commission for allegedly committing deceitful acts and malpractice in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>The facts which gave rise to the filing of the administrative complaints are as follows:<br><br>Sometime in 2002, complainant charged Marilyn Carido (Marilyn) and her common law husband Japanese national Yoshimi Nakayama (Nakayama) before the Digos City Prosecutor's Office for violation of the Anti-Dummy Law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> claiming that the Bamiyan Group of Enterprises (Bamiyan) which was capitalized at P15 million and which was engaged in, among other things, money lending business and operation of <span style="font-style: italic;">miki</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">siopao</span> factory was actually owned by Nakayama but it was made to appear that Marilyn was the owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Marilyn, by her Counter-Affidavit dated November 6, 2002 which she filed before the Prosecutor's Office, denied the charge, in support of which she attached a Memorandum of Joint Venture Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (the document) forged by her and Nakayama, acknowledged before respondent on January 9, 2001 but appearing to have been entered in respondent's notarial register for 2002 and bearing respondent's Professional Tax Receipt (PTR) No. issued in 2002. The document purported to show that Marilyn owned Bamiyan, albeit its capital was provided by Nakayama.<br><br>Contending that the January 9, 2001 document did not exist before she filed the criminal charge in 2002 before the Prosecutor's Office, complainant, who was formerly an employee of Bamiyan,  filed the first above captioned administrative complaint against respondent, as well as criminal complaints for falsification of public document and use of falsified public document before the Prosecutor's Office also against respondent, together with Marilyn, Nakayama, and the witnesses to the document Mona Liza Galvez and John Doe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>It appears that on April 20, 2001, respondent notarized a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of a parcel of land situated in Digos City, purportedly executed by Manuel Jose Lozada (Lozada) as vendor and Marilyn as vendee. Complainant alleged that respondent falsified the document by forging the signature of Lozada who has been staying in Maryland, U.S.A. since 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Hence, spawned the second above-captioned administrative complaint.<br><br>After respondent submitted her Comment to which she attached her November 18, 2002 Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to the Affidavit-Complaint of Marilyn charging her with falsification before the Prosecutor's Office, the administrative complaints were referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation within 60 days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Commissioner Doroteo Aguila, to whom the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline assigned the cases, set them for mandatory conference on November 24, 2003. It turned out that complainant had died on September 15, 2003. Complainant's husband Celso Mondejar had requested, however, that consideration of the cases continue on the basis of documentary evidence already submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In her Position Paper filed with the IBP, respondent argued that complainant was neither a party nor a witness to the document as well as to the Deed of Absolute Sale, hence, devoid of legal standing to question the authenticity and due execution thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Besides, added respondent, complainant had passed away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>To her Position Paper respondent again attached her November 18, 2002 Counter-Affidavit which she filed with the Digos City Prosecutor's Office wherein she explained that the discrepancies of dates appearing in the document executed by Nakayama and Marilyn on January 9, 2001 came about when the document was "revise[d] and amend[ed]" in 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After evaluation of the evidence of the parties, Investigating Commissioner Aguila, by Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated May 12, 2004, recommended the dismissal of the second complainant (Administrative Case No. 5942) relative to respondent's notarization of the Deed of Sale.<br><br>As for the first complaint (Administrative Case No. 5907) relative to the discrepancies of dates appearing in the document, Commissioner Aguila found respondent to have violated Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility reading:<br><blockquote>Canon 1, Rule 1.01 - A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct,<br></blockquote>and recommended respondent's suspension from the practice of law for One Month.<br><br>Pertinent portions of Atty. Aguila's Report read:<br><blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">[T]here is sufficient proof to discipline the respondent in Adm. Case No. 5907</span>.  In the Memorandum of a Joint Venture Agreement, Atty. Rubia stated in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">acknowledgment portion</span> thereof that the parties <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personally appeared before her "on this 9th day of January, <span style="font-weight: bold;">2001</span></span>." But then this document . . . was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entered in respondent's notarial register</span> as Document No. 5707;  Page No. 1144;  Book No 25; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Series of <span style="font-weight: bold;">2002</span></span> [Annex "A-1," Petition].  It is further pointed out that respondent's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PTR</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number</span> as indicated in this document is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">PTR</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Number</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">4574844</span> that is likewise indicated as being <span style="text-decoration: underline;">issued on January 3, <span style="font-weight: bold;">2002</span></span>.  On the other hand, the [Counter] Affidavit of Marilyn Carido, which Atty. Rubia notarized . . . was notarized on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 6, 2002</span> [Annex "B-2" of the Petition]. This [counter] affidavit also indicates respondent's PTR Number as <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">4574844</span> issued on<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> January 3, 2002</span>. It must be stressed that this is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same Number indicated in the Memorandum of a Joint Venture Agreement</span> [notarized on <span style="font-weight: bold;">January 9, 2001</span>].  But then a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deed of Absolute Sale dated 28 March<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2001</span></span> between one Leandro Prosia and Jocelyn Canoy-Alson [Annex "D," Petition] that was also notarized by respondent, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">indicates that her PTR for the year <span style="font-weight: bold;">2001 </span>was PTR No. <span style="font-weight: bold;">4320009</span></span> [p. 14, SC Records].<br><br>As already pointed out, the [January 9, 2001] Memorandum of a Joint Venture Agreement indicates that it was entered as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document No. 5707, Series of 2002</span> in respondent's notarial register.  On the other hand, the [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">November 6, 2002</span>] Affidavit of Marilyn Carido was entered as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Document No. <span style="font-weight: bold;">2791</span>, Series of 2002</span>.  Since the [Counter] Affidavit was notarized [o]n <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">06 November 2002</span>,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> it is</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">illogical why the document number for the Memorandum of a Joint Venture is greater (higher) than that of the former since the latter was supposed to have been notarized many months earlier, </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">or specifically, on</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> 09 January 2001.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br>All of the foregoing show that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent effectively made an <span style="font-weight: bold;">untruthful declaration</span> in a public document when she attested that the Memorandum of a Joint Venture Agreement was acknowledged before her on 09 January 2001 when evidence clearly shows otherwise.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>By Resolution of July 30, 2004, the IBP Board of Governors (BOG) adopted the finding of the Investigating Commissioner's Report that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent violated Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility for making a false declaration in a public document.</span> It, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">modified</span> the recommended sanction in that, instead of suspension from the practice of law for One Month, it merely WARNED respondent that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future would be dealt with more severely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>By Resolution of March 12, 2005, the BOG denied respondent's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Hence, the elevation of the first administrative case to this Court by respondent who reiterates her challenge to the standing of complainant's husband in pursuing the cases.<br><br>Rule 139-B, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides that "[p]roceedings for the disbarment, suspension, or discipline of attorneys may be taken by the Supreme Court <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio,</span> or by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) upon the verified complaint of any person."<br><br>That an administrative complaint filed by any person against a lawyer may be acted upon by this Court is settled. <span style="font-style: italic;">In re Almacen</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> explains the <span style="font-style: italic;">raison d'être:</span><br><blockquote>. . . [D]isciplinary proceedings [against lawyers] are sui generis. Neither purely civil nor purely criminal, this proceeding is not - and does not involve - a trial of an action or a suit, but is rather an investigation by the Court into the conduct of its officers. Not being intended to inflict punishment, it is in no sense a criminal prosecution.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accordingly, there is neither a plaintiff nor a prosecutor therein.  It may be initiated by the Court <span style="font-style: italic;">motu proprio</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>  Public interest is its primary objective, and the real question for determination is whether or not the attorney is still a fit person to be allowed the privileges as such.  Hence, in the exercise of its disciplinary powers, the Court merely calls upon a member of the Bar to account for his actuations as an officer of the Court with the end in view of preserving the purity of the legal profession and the proper and honest administration of justice by purging the profession of members who by their misconduct have proved themselves no longer worthy to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the office of an attorney.  In such posture, there can thus be no occasion to speak of a complainant or a prosecutor. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Complainant's husband's pursuance of the cases was thus in order.<br><br>Notarization by a notary public converts a private document into a public document, thus rendering the document admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Lawyers commissioned as notaries public are thus mandated to subscribe to the sacred duties appertaining to their office, such duties being dictated by public policy impressed with public interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A graver responsibility is placed upon them by reason of their solemn oath to obey the laws, to do no falsehood or consent to the doing of any,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and to guard against any illegal or immoral arrangement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and other duties and responsibilities.<br><br>In exculpation, respondent, in her November 18, 2002 Counter Affidavit, proffered the following explanation, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">x x x x<br></div><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>That way back <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the early 2001, specifically in January of the year 2001, Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama, had me prepared [sic] a document</span> in preparation of the business enterprises to be established by Marilyn A. Carido, wherein Yoshimi Nakayama, will grant the former CAPITAL for the establishment of the proposed enterprises, the main purpose of which is to secure the future of Marilyn A. Carido, their children, and the family of Marilyn A. Carido. A copy of the said agreement is hereto attached as ANNEX "A," with its corresponding submarking;<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><ol start="7"><li>That in fact, on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">May 10, 2002</span>, Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama came to my office, for two (2) purposes: First, Yoshimi Nakayama had me <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prepared a document which would be an ADDENDUM to their original transaction in January 2001</span>, wherein Yoshimi Nakayama gave Marilyn A. Carido additional capital to augment the operation of the "Bamiyan Superstore;" Second, that Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama wanted me to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">REVISE and AMEND the original agreement made by them in January, 2001</span>, because Yoshimi Nakayama wanted to add certain conditions to the original agreement, specifically referring to the flow of money unto the coffers of the enterprises of Marilyn A. Carido, and as to the fact of the technical assistance that he is giving Marilyn A. Carido, because, at that time, there were already many problems in the operations of the Bamiyan enterprises. That, for the first purpose, I prepared the ADDENDUM to the original agreement between Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama. A copy of the said addendum is hereto attached and made another part hereof as ANNEX "C," with its corresponding submarking;<br><br></li><li>That for the second purpose <span style="text-decoration: underline;">referring to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVISION or AMENDMENT of the original transaction</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">,</span> I told both Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama, to submit to me all the copies of the original agreement in their possession, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I will just make another instrument which would supplant or replace the old one</span> while incorporating the needed conditions suggested by Yoshimi Nakayama. That I told them that<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> I will be making a <span style="font-weight: bold;">new and/or revised agreement, but I will retain the original date of the first transaction made in January, 2001, because anyway, I have not yet submitted the documents which I have notarized for the year 2001, since my notarial commission will expire yet on the last day of December, 2002;</span></span><br><br></li><li>That, therefore, on the same date, Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama submitted to me all the copies in their possession of the old agreement, and I proceeded to have another one encoded in my computer by my secretary, Mona Liza Galvez, incorporating the needed additional conditions in accordance with the wishes of my said clients. A copy of the said REVISED agreement is hereto attached as ANNEX "D," with the its corresponding submarkings;<br><br></li><li>That in fact, on November 6, 2002, I attached a copy of the revised agreement on the COUNTER-AFFIDAVIT of Marilyn A. Carido, in the case for a violation of the Anti-Dummy law filed against her by an assumed witness, Elsa Mondejar who is also the assumed complainant in this instant investigation; That, however, while I was going over the documents of Marilyn A. Carido, I noticed that the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revised agreement referred to above, although retained the original date of the original one as January, 2001, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mistakenly or erroneously</span> bear the series of 2002 in my notarial register, and likewise bear my new PROFESSIONAL TAX RECEIPT (PTR) NO. and IBP No. for the year 2002;</span><br><br></li><li>That even before then, I already instructed my secretary to make the necessary corrections in the said revised document because the accountant and administrator of the Bamiyan, Felicisima Abo, had already brought the erroneous entries to my attention when all the legal papers of Marilyn A. Carido were turned over to her profession, as early as June, 2002. That, however, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because of my workload, I forgot to remind my secretary about the corrections</span> that she should made therein. However, I already told Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama, that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the corrections are proper because I will just make the necessary initials on the corrected portions;</span><br><br></li><li>That, again because of the fact, that I had to arrange certain matters on the labor aspects of all the Bamiyan enterprises, because at these times, both Marilyn A. Carido and Yoshimi Nakayama, were in Japan,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> it was only after I filed the counter-affidavit of Marilyn A. Carido, in the said Anti-Dummy case, that I was reminded on the said erroneous entries. Therefore, on <span style="font-weight: bold;">November 8, 2002</span>, I had Mona Liza Galvez, <span style="font-weight: bold;">my secretary, make the necessary corrections;</span></span> A copy of the corrected revised agreement is hereto attached as ANNEX "E," with the corresponding submarkings; as well as copies of the memos that I had issued in behalf of my principal, Marilyn A. Carido, for the Bamiyan, are likewise hereto attached as ANNEXES "F" TO "I," respectively;<br></li></ol><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>In sum, respondent claimed that the document was forged on January 9, 2001 but she made a "new and/or revised agreement" in 2002 to incorporate additional conditions thereto, retaining, however, its original date - January 9, 2001; that on noticing that the document "mistakenly or erroneously [b]ore the series of 2002 in [her] notarial register and likewise b[ore] her new . . . [PTR] No. and IBP No. for the year 2002," she instructed her secretary to make the necessary corrections, but on account of her workload, she forgot to remind her secretary to comply therewith; and that it was only after Marilyn's Counter-Affidavit of November 6, 2002 was filed before the Prosecutor's Office that she (respondent) was reminded of the erroneous entries, hence, she had her secretary make the corrections on November 8, 2002.<br><br>And as reflected in her above-quoted portions of her Counter-Affidavit, respondent further claimed that she retained the original January 9, 2001 date of the document since the "documents which [she] notarized for the year 2001" were not yet submitted as her notarial commission was to expire yet on the last day of December, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Respondent's explanation does not impress as it betrays her guilt.<br><br>The document clearly appears to have been ante-dated in an attempt to exculpate Marilyn from the Anti-Dummy charge against her in 2002.<br><br>The document was allegedly notarized on January 9, 2001 but a new revised/amended document was made in 2002 bearing the original date of execution/acknowledgment. If that were so, how could an error have been committed regarding the other year 2001 original entries in the notarial register, when the purported new document was to retain the original January 9, 2001 date as it would merely input additional conditions thereto? The above-quoted discussion by the Investigating IBP Commissioner of why he discredited respondent's explanation behind the conflicting dates appearing in the document is thus well-taken.<br><br>As for respondent's submission that corrections could be subsequently made on the document, she not having anyway submitted the documents she notarized for the year 2001 since her notarial commission was still to expire in 2002, the same does not lie.<br><br>One of the grounds for revocation of notarial commission is the failure of the notary to send a copy of notarized documents to the proper clerk of court or Executive Judge (under the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice) <span style="font-style: italic;">within the first ten (10) days of the month next following</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In fine, the recommendation of Investigating IBP Commissioner Aguila merits this Court's approval.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, respondent, Atty.
