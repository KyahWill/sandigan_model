				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court on appeal is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 00705 affirming the ruling<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iriga City in Criminal Case No. IR-5813, convicting appellant Ardel Canuto of rape.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Case for the People</span><br></div><br>Efren Bayrante and his wife Teresita Bolo had three (3) children. One of them, Emily, was born on April 19, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The family resided in <i>Barangay</i> Carangay, Baao, Camarines Sur. Efren passed away sometime later.<br><br>In 1991, Teresita began living with Ardel Canuto, an ex-convict. Teresita's mother, Carmen, objected to the relationship. Carmen insisted that Emily and her siblings reside with her. Carmen's house<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was about 80 to 100 meters away from where Teresita and Ardel lived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Teresita complied and had Emily brought to her mother's house where her cousins, nine-year old Jennifer, seven-year old Rose-Ann and three-year old Jennilyn, all surnamed Gonzales, also resided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On June 26, 1999, Carmen left her house to go to the <i>poblacion</i> to assist someone who was delivering a child. Emily and her cousins were left at the house. At about 9:00 p.m., while Emily was sleeping in a room illuminated by a gas lamp and about a meter away from where her cousins were sleeping,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> she was suddenly awakened by something sharp, poking on the left side of her neck. She was shocked to see that it was Ardel, holding the ice pick with his right hand. He warned her not to make any noise, otherwise, she would be killed. Emily was powerless as Ardel removed her shorts and panty. He then removed his shorts and mounted her, placed his legs between hers and had his way with her. Emily felt pain. After a minute or two, Ardel dismounted. Before he left the house, he warned the petrified girl not to tell anyone what he had done, or else, he would kill her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>When her grandmother arrived home the next day, June 27, 1999, Emily did not tell her that Ardel had raped her the night before.  Remembering his threats to kill her, Emily likewise did not reveal her ordeal to her mother.<br><br>At about 11:00 p.m. on June 28, 1999, Ardel raped Emily again.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She once more kept the incident to herself for fear that she would be killed.<br><br>Sometime in August 1999, Emily was raped anew, this time, by Ricardo Brisenio. As a result, she became pregnant. When she learned that her niece was pregnant, Irma Boncayao, a businesswoman, fetched her and brought her to her home in Agos, Bato, Camarines Sur. Irma intended to adopt the baby because she was childless. At that time, Irma did not know who the father of Emily's baby was.   It was only later that she learned that Ricardo Brisenio had impregnated Emily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>However, Irma noticed that Emily was sad and restless. At about 6:00 p.m. on January 10, 2000, Irma brought Emily to Naga City and bought clothes for her. Worried, Irma asked what was bothering her, and it was then that Emily revealed that she had been raped by Ardel and Ricardo. Emily was trembling with fear and crying as she related how Ardel and Ricardo had raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Emily embraced Irma and pleaded for help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Irma forthwith fetched Teresita and Carmen and brought them to her house where Emily recounted how she had been taken advantage of by Ardel and Ricardo. The three then brought Emily to Dr. Catherine O. Buban who examined the girl on January 11, 2000. The doctor found hymenal lacerations at 4, 7, 8, 9, and 12 o'clock positions, and declared that Emily was about 5 to 6 months pregnant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> scheduled to deliver the baby by May 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On January 13, 2000, Emily filed a criminal complaint for rape against Ardel Canuto with the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Camarines Sur. Her mother, Teresita signed the complaint and executed an affidavit before the public prosecutor on the same day. She alleged, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia</span>, the following: <blockquote> <i>Na noong ika-11 ng Enero 2000, dinala namin ang aking anak na si Emily sa [doctor] upang patingnan kung positibong buntis ito at nang kami ay umuwi na, sinabi sa akin ng aking bayaw na si Erma (sic)Boncayao, na kasama naming sa pagpunta sa doctor, na nagtapat sa kanya si Emily na ito raw ay ginahasa din ng aking pangalawang asawa na si ARDEL CANUTO noong buwan ng Hunyo 1999 at ito rin ang nakabuntis kay Emily.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </blockquote> Emily also filed a criminal complaint for rape against Ricardo Brisenio with the Office of the Public Prosecutor.<br><br>Two Informations for rape were filed against Ardel Canuto with the RTC of Iriga City, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 5814 (raffled to Branch 37) and 5813 (raffled to Branch 35). The Information in the latter case reads: <blockquote> That on or about the 26th day of June 1999, in <i>[B]arangay</i> Caranday, Municipality of Baao, Province of Camarines Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then her stepfather, with lewd design, by means of force and intimidation, while armed with an ice pick, did then and there willfully, unlawfuly and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his stepdaughter Emily Bayrante y Bolo, a 15-year-old girl, against her will and consent, to the damage and prejudice of the offended party in such amount as may be proven in court.<br><br>ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </blockquote> <div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Case for the Appellant</b><br></div><br>Ardel interposed the defenses of denial and alibi. He testified that he was a farmer by profession. On June 26, 1999, he planted corn from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in their farm near their house as he usually did. When he arrived home, his wife, Teresita, and their four children were in the house. They had dinner at 6:30 p.m. and rested at 7:00 p.m. He woke up at 8:00 a.m. the next day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He denied having raped Emily. His wife Teresita told him that Ricardo Brisenio had raped Emily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He was so incensed when he learned this that he and his wife rushed to the house of Ricardo and confronted him. Ardel admitted that he and Emily had no ill-feelings against each other before June 26, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Teresita corroborated the testimony of Ardel. She declared that she and Ardel had four children: Arnold, 11 years old; Mary Jane, 9 years old; Jason, 7 years old; and Aileen, 5 years old. On the night in question, they had dinner in their house at 6:00 p.m. and went to bed afterwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When she woke up at 4:00 a.m. to answer the call of nature,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Ardel was in the house, still sleeping. She declared that her Affidavit dated January 13, 2000 was not explained to her. She only finished Grade IV and could not read or write except her name and family name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>   She also admitted that she and Emily had a good relationship before June 26, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Emily testified on rebuttal and declared that her mother, Teresita, signed her Affidavit on January 13, 2000. Her mother testified for Ardel because according to her mother, it was better to lose a child than to lose a husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> She delivered her baby on May 4, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></div><br>On April 1, 2003, the trial court rendered judgment convicting Ardel of rape. The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads: <blockquote> WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the prosecution having successfully proved the guilt, of accused Ardel Canuto beyond reasonable doubt, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and is hereby ordered to indemnify Emily Bayrante in the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos and Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos as moral damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </blockquote> The RTC rejected Ardel's defenses of denial and alibi, and gave credence and full probative weight to Emily's testimony that she had been raped by Ardel. It also declared that the prosecution failed to prove that Ardel had been lawfully married to Teresita, hence, was merely the latter's common-law husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Consequently, the court sentenced Ardel to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Ardel appealed the decision to this Court, which, however, transferred the case to the Court of Appeals (CA) in deference to the ruling in <i>People v. Efren Mateo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Ruling of the Appellate Court</b><br></div><br>Ardel averred in his Brief before the CA that the trial court erred in giving credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and, consequently, erred in convicting him of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He insisted that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt and that he adduced clear and convincing evidence to prove his alibi. His testimony was corroborated by Teresita Bolo who is the mother of Emily. He averred that he should not be charged and convicted of the crime committed by Ricardo Brisenio.<br><br>On April 22, 2005, the CA rendered judgment affirming the decision of the trial court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> hence, the instant appeal, where Ardel, as appellant, adopted his Brief in the CA as his Supplemental Brief in this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ruling of the Court</span><br></div><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>We have reviewed the evidence on record and find that, indeed, the prosecution adduced evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant raped Emily at about 9:00 p.m. on June 26, 1999 in the house of Carmen Bolo. The victim narrated in a spontaneous and straightforward manner how she was defiled by the appellant, thus:<br><blockquote><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Do you know the accused in this case, Ardel Canuto?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">If he is in court, kindly point to him.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">INTERPRETER:</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td> <br></td> <td><div align="justify">Witness pointed to a man inside the courtroom who answered to the name (sic) Ardel Canuto.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"> PROS.

The latter admitted that it is just two minutes walk (<i>sic</i>) to the house of Carmen from their house. It was not possible (<i>sic</i>) for him to have sneaked out from their house when his wife was already asleep and committed the alleged crime of rape at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of June 26, 1999.  Emily Bayrante testified in a clear, convincing and straightforward manner that in the night of June 26, 1999, the accused suddenly appeared before her, poked an icepick to her neck and succeeded in raping her. She was not able to resist the beastly attack of the accused because she was threatened to be killed and (<i>sic</i>) knowing that the accused was incarcerated for killing a man, she was unable to defend her honor for fear that he might make true his threats.<br><br>The court is morally certain that the accused committed the crime of rape as charged and is found to be guilty of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </blockquote> The appellate court affirmed the findings of the trial court. The rule is that, unless the trial court ignored, misinterpreted or misunderstood facts and circumstances of substance which, if considered, would reverse or modify the outcome of the case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed: <blockquote> xxx Time-honored is the doctrine that no young and decent woman would publicly admit that she was ravished and her virtue defiled, unless such was true, for it would be instinctive for her to protect her honor. No woman would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts and submit herself to public humiliation and scrutiny via an open trial, if her sordid tale was not true and her sole motivation was not to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<br><br>It bears emphasis that the victim was barely thirteen when she was raped. It is settled jurisprudence that testimonies of child-victims are given full weight and credit, since when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<br><br>Furthermore, as a rule, appellate courts will not disturb the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, for the trial court is in a better position to pass upon the same. As succinctly explained in the case of <i>People vs. Atop</i>, the trial court has the valuable edge of observing the witness' deportment and manner of testifying, her "furtive glance, blush of conscious shame, hesitation, flippant or sneering tone, calmness, sigh, or the scant or full realization of an oath" - all of which are useful aids for an accurate determination of a witness' honesty and sincerity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </blockquote> Indeed, the rule is that when a rape victim's testimony is straightforward and candid, unshaken by rigid cross-examination and unflawed inconsistencies, or contradictions in its material points, the same must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The appellant has not adduced any evidence of ill-motive on the part of Emily to falsely charge him of the heinous crime of rape. On the other hand, the appellant testified that, before June 26, 1999, Emily had no ill-feelings or grudge against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Absent any ill-motive on the part of Emily to falsely charge the appellant of rape, the presumption is that, she is telling the truth; hence, her testimony is entitled to full probative weight. It would run counter to the natural order of events and of human nature, and contrary to the presumption of good faith, for a prosecution witness to falsely testify if the appellant is truly innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed that the appellant's defense of denial and alibi was rejected by the trial court. The appellate court ruled as follows: <blockquote> Contrary to the defense's posturing, the accused-appellant's alibi and denial cannot prevail over the positive identification by the private complainant as regards her rapist (<i>People vs. Remoto,</i> 244 SCRA 506). Moreover, for alibi to qualify as a valid defense, it must first be shown that it was physically impossible for the accused to have been present in the <i>locus criminis</i> at the supposed time of commission of the crime (<i>People vs. Caguioa, Sr., 259 SCRA 403</i>). In this case, the accused-appellant cannot cavil at the fact that the house of Carmen Bolo where the private complainant was staying was only a few minutes walk from the house of the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </blockquote> The appellant's denial of the crime charged constitutes negative self-serving evidence which cannot prevail over the positive testimony of Emily that the appellant had defiled her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moreover, alibi as a defense is inherently weak because it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove. The appellant must prove, with clear and convincing evidence at the trial that he was in a place other than the <i>situs</i> of the crime, such that it was physically impossible for him to have committed the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The requirement of time and place must be strictly followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In this case, the house of Carmen Bolo where Emily resided was just 80 to 100 meters away from the house of the appellant, and there was a trail between the two houses:<br><br>PROS.

However, Teresita declared that <i>she awoke at 4:00 a.m. on June 27, 1999</i> when she answered the call of nature. It was thus entirely possible that the appellant had gone out of the house while she was asleep and committed the dastardly act.
