At said meeting, defendant informed plaintiff that the proposed purchase price for said floors was TWENTY[-]ONE MILLION PESOS (P21,000,000.00);<br><br></li><li>On February 22, 1993, defendant, in a letter signed by its Trustee, Juan W. Moran, informed plaintiff thru Atty. Jose Feria, Jr., that the Board of Trustees (BOT) of APT "is in agreement that Mr. Jose Moreno, Jr. has the right of first refusal" and requested plaintiff to deposit 10% of the "suggested indicative price" of P21.0 million on or before February 26, 1993 – which letter is attached hereto as Annex "A" and made an integral part of this pleading;<br><br></li><li>Plaintiff paid the P2.1 million on February 26, 1993.

A copy of this communication is attached hereto as Annex "D" and made an integral part hereof; <br><br></li><li>The questions to be resolved by this Honorable Court are:</li> <br>7.01. Whether or not there was a perfected contract of sale over the said floors for the amount of P21.0 million, which will give rise to a right on the part of the plaintiff to demand that the said floors be sold to him for said amount;<br><br>7.02.

From the time respondent filed its Notice of Appeal with the trial court, the parties submitted numerous motions, including petitioner's Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated July 8, 1996. Petitioner moved that the case be dismissed due to the failure of respondent to file its brief within the reglementary period.<br><br>On December 18, 1997, the Eighth Division of the appellate court granted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the motion to dismiss and denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> respondent's motion for reconsideration. Respondent then filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with this Court to reverse the dismissal of the appeal. On July 5, 1999, this Court, through a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the Third Division, reversed the resolution dismissing the appeal on the ground that the appeal raises substantial issues justifying a review of the case on the merits.<br><br>On January 30, 2003, the appellate court found that there was no perfected contract of sale over the subject floors and reversed the ruling of the trial court,<span style="font-style: italic;"> viz.:</span><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby GRANTED.

Hence, this Petition contending that:<br><blockquote>IN REVERSING THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION DATED 10 AUGUST 1994, THE COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED ISSUES NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW AND THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE HONORABLE COURT CONSIDERING THAT:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>GIVEN THE UNDISPUTED FACTS OF THE INSTANT CASE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS A PERFECTED, VALID AND BINDING CONTRACT OF SALE BETWEEN PETITIONER MORENO AND RESPONDENT APT (NOW PMO) WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE PRINCIPLE OF ESTOPPEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPLIED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS TO HOLD RESPONDENT APT (NOW PMO) TO ITS CONTRACT OF SALE WITH PETITIONER MORENO CONSIDERING THAT:<br><blockquote>A. THERE IS NOTHING IRREGULAR OR UNCONSCIONABLE IN THE ACTS OF THE AGENTS OF RESPONDENT APT (NOW PMO) IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFECTED AND PARTIALLY EXECUTED CONTRACT OF SALE.<br><br>B.

The <span style="font-weight: bold;">offer must be certain</span> and the acceptance absolute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>To reach that moment of perfection, the parties must agree on the same thing in the same sense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> so that their minds meet as to all the terms.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> They must have a distinct intention common to both and without doubt or difference; until all understand alike, there can be no assent, and therefore no contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The minds of parties must meet at every point; nothing can be left open for further arrangement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> So long as there is any uncertainty or indefiniteness, or future negotiations or considerations to be had between the parties, there is not a completed contract, and in fact, there is no contract at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Contract formation undergoes three distinct stages – preparation or negotiation, perfection or birth, and consummation.  Negotiation begins from the time the prospective contracting parties manifest their interest in the contract and ends at the moment of agreement of the parties.  The perfection or birth of the contract takes place when the parties agree upon all the essential elements thereof. The last stage is the consummation of the contract wherein the parties fulfill or perform the terms agreed upon, culminating in its extinguishment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Once there is concurrence of the offer and acceptance of the object and cause, the stage of negotiation is finished. This situation does not obtain in the case at bar. The letter of February 22, 1993 and the surrounding circumstances clearly show that the parties are not past the stage of negotiation, hence there could not have been a perfected contract of sale.<br><br>The letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> is clear evidence that respondent did not intend to sell the subject floors at the price certain of P21,000,000.00, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.:</span><br><blockquote>22 February 1993<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">ATTY. JOSE FERIA, JR.<br>FERIA, FERIA, LUGTU &amp; LAO<br>Ferlaw Building, 336 Cabildo Street<br>Intramuros, Manila<br></div><br>Dear Atty. Feria:<br><br>During its meeting on February 19, 1993, our Board reviewed your letter of February 18, 1993.<br><br>We are pleased to inform you that the Board is in agreement that Mr. Jose Moreno, Jr. has the right of first refusal. This will be confirmed by our Board during the next board meeting on February 26, 1993. In the meantime, please advise Mr. Moreno that the suggested indicative price for APT's five (5) floors of the building in question is P21 Million.<br><br>If Mr. Moreno is in agreement, he should deposit with APT the amount of P2.1 Million equivalent to 10% of the price on or before February 26, 1993. The balance will be due within fifteen (15) days after Mr. Moreno receives the formal notice of approval of the indicative price.<br><br>If you or Mr. Moreno have (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) any question, please let me know.<br><br>Very truly yours,<br><br>(Signed)<br>JUAN W. MORAN<br>Associate Executive Trustee<br></blockquote>The letter clearly states that P21,000,000.00 is merely a "suggested indicative price" of the subject floors as it was yet to be approved by the Board of Trustees. Before the Board could confirm the suggested indicative price, the Committee on Privatization must first approve the terms of the sale or disposition. The imposition of this suspensive condition finds basis under Proclamation No. 50<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> which vests in the Committee the power to approve the sale of government assets, including the price of the asset to be sold, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.:</span><br><blockquote>ARTICLE II. COMMITTEE ON PRIVATIZATION<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x  x  x<br></div><br>SECTION 5. POWERS AND FUNCTIONS. The Committee shall have the following powers and functions:<br><blockquote>(1) x x x x Provided, further, that any such independent disposition shall be undertaken with the prior approval of the Committee and in accordance with the general disposition guidelines as the Committee may provide; Provided, finally, that in every case the sale or disposition shall be approved by the Committee with respect to the buyer and price only;<br><div style="text-align: center;">x  x  x<br></div><br>(4) To approve or disapprove, on behalf of the National Government and without need of any further approval or other action from any other government institution or agency, the sale or disposition of such assets, in each case on terms and to purchasers recommended by the Trust or the government institution, as the case may be, to whom the disposition of such assets may have been delegated; Provided that, the Committee shall not itself undertake the marketing of any such assets, or participate in the negotiation of their sale;<br><div style="text-align: center;">x  x  x<br></div></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>ARTICLE III. ASSET PRIVATIZATION TRUST<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x  x  x<br></div><br>SECTION 12. POWERS. The Trust shall, in the discharge of its responsibilities, have the following powers:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x  x  x<br></div><br>(2) Subject to its having received the prior written approval of the Committee to sell such asset at a price and on terms of payment and to a party disclosed to the Committee, to sell each asset referred to it by the Committee to such party and on such terms as in its discretion are in the best interest of the National Government, and for such purpose to execute and deliver, on behalf and in the name of the National Government. Such deeds of sale, contracts and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to convey title to such assets;<br></blockquote></blockquote>Petitioner construes Section 12, Article III of the Proclamation differently. He argues that what the law says is that even before respondent sells or offers for sale a government asset, the terms thereof have already been previously approved by the Committee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.,</span> "[s]ubject to its having received the <span style="font-weight: bold;">prior</span> written approval of the Committee to sell such an asset at a price and on terms of payment and to a party disclosed to the Committee, to sell each asset referred to it by the Committee to such party and on such terms as in its discretion are in the best interest of the National Government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, the Committee's approval of the suggested indicative price of P21,000,000.00 is not necessary.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>If we adopt the argument of petitioner, Section 12, Article III would nullify the power granted to the Committee under Section 5 (4), Article II of the same Proclamation. Under Section 5 (4), the Committee has the power "to <span style="font-weight: bold;">approve or disapprove</span>, on behalf of the National Government and without need of any further approval or other action from any other government institution or agency, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the sale or disposition of such assets, in each case on terms and to purchasers recommended by the Trust</span> or the government institution, as the case may be, to whom the disposition of such assets may have been delegated; Provided that, the Committee shall not itself undertake the marketing of any such assets, or participate in the negotiation of their sale."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The law is clear that the Trust shall recommend the terms for the Committee's approval or disapproval, and not the other way around.<br><br>It is a basic canon of statutory construction that in interpreting a statute, care should be taken that every part thereof be given effect, on the theory that it was enacted as an integrated measure and not as a hodge-podge of conflicting provisions. The rule is that a construction that would render a provision inoperative should be avoided; instead, apparently inconsistent provisions should be reconciled whenever possible as parts of a coordinated and harmonious whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>To bolster the argument that the Committee's approval may be dispensed with, petitioner also cites Opinion No. 27, Series of 1989, of the Secretary of Justice which recognizes a case where the Committee may delegate to respondent the power to approve the sale or disposition of assets with a transfer price not exceeding P60,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The argument fails to impress. The Opinion involves a case where "no material discretion is involved in the disposition of assets pursuant to the subject proposal" and the act which could be delegated, as opined, is ministerial. The Opinion further notes that "the criteria and guidelines stated therein are concrete and definite enough that once these criteria and guidelines are present in a particular case, the APT is practically left with no choice in the disposition of the assets involved and that all that the APT shall do in disposing off an asset thereunder is ascertain whether a prospective buyer and the price he offers satisfy such conditions." Petitioner failed to show that the case at bar is of the same nature – that is, that the disposition of the subject floors "partakes of the nature of a ministerial act which has been defined as one performed under a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to the exercise of judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done."<br><br>Petitioner further argues that the "suggested indicative price" of P21,000,000.00 is not a proposed price, but the selling price indicative of the value at which respondent was willing to sell.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Petitioner posits that under Section 14, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court, the term should be taken in its ordinary and usual acceptation and should be taken to mean as a price which is "indicated" or "specified" which, if accepted, gives rise to a meeting of minds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This was the same construction adopted by the trial court, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.:</span><br><blockquote>Going to defendant's main defense that P21 Million was a "suggested indicative price" – we have to find out exactly what "indicative" means. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Webster Comprehensive Dictionary, International Edition,</span> gives us a graphic meaning that everybody can understand, when it says that "to indicate" is [t]o point out; direct attention[;] to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">indicate</span> the correct page[.] "Indicative" is merely the adjective of the verb to indicate. x x x when the price of P21 [M]illion was indicated – then it becomes the "indicative" price – the correct price, no ifs[,] no buts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (<span style="font-style: italic;">emphases in the original</span>)<br></blockquote>We do not agree.<br><br>Under the same section and rule invoked by petitioner, the terms of a writing are presumed to have been used in their primary and general acceptation, but evidence is admissible to show that they have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">local, technical, or otherwise peculiar signification,</span> and were so used and understood in the particular instance, in which case the agreement must be construed accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The reliance of the trial court in the Webster definition of the term "indicative," as also adopted by petitioner, is misplaced. The transaction at bar involves the sale of an asset under a privatization scheme which attaches a peculiar meaning or signification to the term "indicative price." Under No. 6.1 of the General Bidding Procedures and Rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of respondent, "an indicative price is a ball-park figure and [respondent] supplies such a figure purely to define the ball-park."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The plain contention of petitioner that the transaction involves an "ordinary armslength sale of property" is unsubstantiated and leaves much to be desired. This case sprung from a case of specific performance initiated by petitioner who has the burden to prove that the case should be spared from the application of the technical terms in the sale and disposition of assets under privatization. Petitioner failed to discharge the burden.<br><br>It appears in the case at bar that petitioner's construction of the letter of February 22, 1993 – that his assent to the "suggested indicative price" of P21,000,000.00 converted it as the price certain, thus giving rise to a perfected contract of sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> – is petitioner's own subjective understanding. As such, it is not shared by respondent. Under American jurisprudence, mutual assent is judged by an <span style="font-weight: bold;">objective standard,</span> looking to the express words the parties used in the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Under the objective theory of contract, understandings and beliefs are effective only if <span style="font-weight: bold;">shared.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Based on the objective manifestations of the parties in the case at bar, there was no meeting of the minds. That the letter constituted a definite, complete and certain offer is the subjective belief of petitioner alone. The letter in question is a mere evidence of a memorialization of inconclusive negotiations, or a mere agreement to agree, in which material term is left for future negotiations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It is a mere evidence of the parties' preliminary transactions which did not crystallize into a perfected contract. Preliminary negotiations or an agreement still involving future negotiations is not the functional equivalent of a valid, subsisting agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> For a valid contract to have been created, the parties must have progressed beyond this stage of imperfect negotiation. But as the records would show, the parties are yet undergoing the preliminary steps towards the formation of a valid contract. Having thus established that there is no perfected contract of sale in the case at bar, the issue on estoppel is now moot and academic.<br><br>Finally, petitioner contends that the appellate court should have dismissed the appeal of respondent on the procedural technicality that the Appellant's Brief does not have page references to the record in its Statement of Facts, Statement of the Case and Arguments in the Appellant's Brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>We find no reason to reverse the ruling of the appellate court which has judiciously explained why the appeal should not be dismissed on this ground, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.:</span><br><blockquote>x x x x Procedural rules are required to be followed as a general rule, but they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his noncompliance with the procedure required. In this case, [respondent's] brief does not substantially violate our procedural rules. Besides, the merits of its arguments will show that the trial court seriously erred in issuing its assailed decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">IN VIEW WHEREOF,</span> the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
