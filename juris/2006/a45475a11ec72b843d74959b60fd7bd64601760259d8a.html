This claim was corroborated by Mary Jane Rodillas and Noemi Feje in their respective affidavits. <br><br>Not denying having uttered "fuck you" and&nbsp; made dirty&nbsp; middle finger sign, respondent justified the same by claiming that they were done in retaliation. Thus she testified:<br><blockquote>Q [Atty.

The Investigating Presiding Judge is persuaded that a confrontation between complainant and respondent did in fact occur. As claimed by respondent, she came from METROBANK and passed by the canteen. Mary Jane Rodillas testified that the time is 2:30 in the afternoon which respondent failed to deny.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">It should be stressed that respondent has been nursing grudge/hatred against complainant <span style="text-decoration: underline;">by</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reason</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">latter's</span>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-payment</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">balance</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">credit</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">card</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refusal</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">return</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">downpayment</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bracelet</span> despite insistent demands by respondent. What is more, the irreconcilable differences had reached such a magnitude to the extent that respondent reported this matter to her parents who called complainant to pay her indebtedness but complainant allegedly invented stories to respondent's parents by saying, "Sinabihan ako ng anak niyo na walang hiya kayong magulang niya, etc." which caused the ire of respondent.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investigating</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Presiding</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Judge</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finds</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">credible</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">allegation</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of complainant</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">been</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sending</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embarrassing</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">text</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">messages to</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">harass</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complainant</span> who appears adamant to the respondent's demands.<br><br>The Code of Judicial Ethics&nbsp; mandates that the conduct of court personnel must be free from any kind of impropriety, not only with respect to their duties in the judicial branch but also to their behavior outside the court as private individuals, inorder to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice.<br><br>Under the given facts, the unprofessional conduct of respondent as court employee could bring the court into disrepute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Emphasis and underlining in the original;&nbsp; underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Thus finding for complainant, Judge Acosta-Villarante recommended that respondent be only reprimanded as this is the first offense that she committed and that her actuations were "anchored on legitimate demands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Then Court Administrator, now Supreme Court Associate &nbsp;Justice Presbitero J. Velasco, Jr., by Report of August 16, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> took exception to Judge Acosta-Villarante's findings in this wise:<br><blockquote>Even if respondent has legitimate demands against complainant, it is still improper for a court employee to make offensive and foul remarks. High strung and belligerent behavior has no place in government service where the personnel are enjoined to act with self-restraint and civility at all times even when confronted with rudeness and insolence. Conduct violative of this standard quickly and surely corrodes respect for the courts.<br><br>However, the fact that this is respondent's first offense is considered a mitigating circumstance in her favor. A fine of P1,000.00 is therefore recommended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court finds Justice Velasco's position well-taken.<br><br>Even if respondent acted in retaliation to complainant's calling her "Sheryll Maniac" when she uttered "fuck you" and made a dirty finger sign, that these were done in public by a court employee who was then wearing office uniform creates a bad impression not only against respondent as an employee but also against the judiciary.<br><br>Courts are looked upon by the people with high respect. Misbehavior by their employees within and around their vicinity necessarily diminishes their sanctity and dignity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; The injunction of this Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Cervantes v. Cardeño</span> thus bears reiterating:<br><blockquote>We take this opportunity to remind, not only the respondent, but all court personnel as well, that the image of the judiciary is <span style="font-weight: bold;">mirrored in the kind of conduct, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">official</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">or</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">otherwise</span>, which the personnel within its employ display</span>, from the judge to the lowest clerk.

Professionalism, respect for the rights of others, good manners and right conduct are expected of all judicial officers and employees. Thus, all employees are required to preserve the judiciary's good name and standing as a&nbsp; true temple of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Disgraceful conduct is classified as a grave offense under Section 52(A) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service which is punishable by suspension of Six (6) Months and One (1) Day to One (1) Year for the first offense. <br><br>Following the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Policarpio v. Fortus</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> however, cited by Justice Velasco in his Report wherein the therein respondent was found to have been engaged in discourteous acts improper of an employee of the Judiciary and was fined P1,000, this Court finds reasonable the recommended penalty of fine in the amount of P1,000.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, for disgraceful acts improper of an employee of the judiciary, respondent Sheryll S.
