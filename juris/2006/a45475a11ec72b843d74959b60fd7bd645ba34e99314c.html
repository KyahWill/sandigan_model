				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">T</span>he Constitution and the Ombudsman Act of 1989 have endowed the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutorial powers -- virtually free from legislative, executive or judicial intervention -- in order to insulate it from outside pressure and improper influence.  Unless tainted with grave abuse of discretion, the judgments and orders of the OMB shall not be reversed, modified or otherwise interfered with by this Court.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span> <br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, assailing the February 19, 1999 Joint Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2] </sup>May 21, 2002 Review and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and March 14, 2003 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Evaluation and Preliminary Investigation Bureau of the OMB.  The challenged Resolution disposed as follows:   <br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the following are respectfully recommended, thus:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'1. That an Information for Estafa (one count) be filed against respondent EMMANUEL T. PONTEJOS before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City; </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">'2.

That respondent CARMENCITA ATOS Y. RUIZ be extended immunity from criminal prosecution in accordance with Section 17 of R.A. 6770 and be utilized as a state witness.'"</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>The Review and Recommendation disapproved Assistant City Prosecutor De Guzman's recommendation to amend the Information for estafa by including Atos as a co-accused; while the Order denied reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> The Facts</span><br></div> <br>Sometime in 1998, Restituto P. Aquino filed an Affidavit/Complaint before the Ombudsman against Emmanuel T. Pontejos (arbiter), Wilfredo I. Imperial (regional director) and Carmencita R. Atos (legal staff), all of them officials of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), and Roderick Ngo, a private individual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6] </sup> <br><br>Aquino accused Pontejos and Atos of conspiring to exact money in exchange for a favorable decision of a case against Roderick Ngo then pending in the HLURB.  He further averred that Pontejos acted as his counsel during the time when the latter was the hearing officer of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]  </sup>Moreover, Atos allegedly received P10,000 in check, which was part of the consideration for a favorable decision.  Imperial was implicated as an alleged accomplice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  <br><br>During preliminary investigation, the following documents were adduced: <br><blockquote>"a. Affidavit-complaint of Restituto P. Aquino, dated 14 August 1998 whereby the complainant narrated at length the charges against respondents; <br><br>"b. Affidavit of Ruth Adel in corroboration of Mr. Aquino's affidavit;<br><br>"c. Another affidavit of Mr. Restituto P. Aquino wherein he revealed the months and dates where he had meetings with Atty. Pontejos and Carmen Atos at Alps Restaurant, Racks Restaurant, Little Quiapo (Q.C.) and Chowking Restaurant; <br><br>"d. Another affidavit of Ruth Adel, wherein the affiant revealed that Ms. Carmen Atos received P10,000.00 in check and had it encashed; <br><br>"e. Affidavit of Rowena Alcovindas corroborating Adel's affidavit; <br><br>"f. A copy of the encashed check showing Ms. Atos signature at the back of the check;<br><br>"g. Copies of several drafts of decision and petitions either prepared in handwriting of Atty. Pontejos or in typewritten form with corrections from Atty. Pontejos in his handwriting; <br><br>"h. NBI Examination Report revealing that the samples and questioned documents were authored by one person (Atty. Pontejos) x  x  x. <br><br>"i. Another affidavit dated 15 February 1999, of [C]omplainant Aquino, wherein he mentioned the places and dates of supposed meetings with Pontejos and Atos as well as the amounts received by them in exchange of legal services and/or favor promised."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>The respondents filed separate Counter-Affidavits to refute the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  They claimed that the meetings mentioned by Aquino did not take place.  Neither did they receive any money from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11] </sup> <br> <br>Pontejos added that there were three cases involving Aquino.  The first one, REM-8652 was filed in 1995 against Aquino by buyers of lots in a subdivision which he allegedly failed to develop.  The second one, REM-9526 was filed by Aquino against Hammercon Inc. (allegedly owned by Roderick Ngo) for revocation of registration and license.  The third case, REM-9817 was filed by Aquino against Hammercon for specific performance or rescission of contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12] </sup> Pontejos decided the first and third cases against Aquino.  The second case, handled by Imperial, was also decided against Aquino.  It was allegedly implausible to side with Aquino, who lost all of the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13] </sup><br><br>Imperial denied all links to the extortion allegedly perpetrated by Pontejos and Atos.  Moreover, he could not have shared with the alleged pay-off money given in January 1998, because he decided the case as far back as September 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <br><br>Atos justified receipt of the P10,000 from Aquino, claiming that it was payment for hams and cold cuts ordered in December 1996 and January 1997 by Ruth Adel, one of the affiants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  In support of this defense, she submitted Joint-Affidavits of her officemates and neighbors confirming her business activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16] </sup> <br><br>Subsequently, Atos issued two Affidavits where she retracted her original defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  She encashed the check allegedly to accommodate Pontejos, who was her boss.  She also recounted attending at least four meetings with Pontejos, Aquino and Adel during which Pontejos offered legal services to Aquino and discussed Aquino's pending cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18] </sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Overall Deputy Ombudsman </span><br></div><br>The Overall Deputy Ombudsman found probable cause against Pontejos for the crimes of estafa, direct bribery and illegal practice of profession in violation of RA 6713.   <br><br>There was estafa because Pontejos allegedly made false pretenses to Aquino in order to receive P25,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]  </sup>He supposedly assured the cancellation of Hammercon's license to sell and registration certificate, notwithstanding the contrary decision issued by Imperial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20] </sup><br><br>Pontejos was guilty of direct bribery for demanding and receiving P100,000 from Aquino in exchange for a favorable decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup> Further, Pontejos should be charged with unauthorized practice of law for providing legal services to Aquino and receiving litigation expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22] </sup>  He purportedly prepared the pleadings that Aquino submitted; these pleadings where confirmed by the NBI to have been authored by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Overall Deputy Ombudsman ruled that Atos should be extended immunity from criminal prosecution and discharged as state witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  According to him, Atos was merely a subordinate who could have acted only upon the prodding of Pontejos.  Also, her testimony was necessary to build a case against Pontejos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]  </sup> <br><br>On June 21, 1999, then Ombudsman Aniano A. Desierto issued a Resolution extending immunity to Atos on the condition that she would appear and testify against Pontejos in accordance with the Affidavits she submitted during the preliminary investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  The Resolution noted that Atos' testimony was extremely necessary to prove the offenses charged against Pontejos and that the available evidence showed that, being a mere clerk, she did not appear to be the most guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <br><br>The criminal cases for estafa and direct bribery against Pontejos were filed before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  On May 13, 1999, Pontejos filed a Motion for Reinvestigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to be conducted by the City Prosecutor without remanding the case to the Ombudsman.  The prosecution had no objection.  Thus, hearing of the case was held in abeyance pending the outcome of the reinvestigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30] </sup><br><br>Assistant City Prosecutor Ma. Teresa E. De Guzman conducted the reinvestigation and thereafter recommended to amend the Information for estafa to include Atos as co-accused.  According to her, the power to grant immunity pertains solely to the courts, not to the prosecution which can only recommend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  The Overall Deputy Ombudsman disapproved De Guzman's report in the May 21, 2002 Review and Recommendation.<br><br>The March 14, 2003 Order denied reconsideration.  Thereafter, Pontejos filed this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32] </sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioner raises the following issues:  <br><blockquote>"1. Whether or not the Ombudsman erred in not declaring that petitioner was denied due process when to this date he was never officially furnished a copy of the Affidavit dated 18 February 1999 of Ms. Atos amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction;<br><br>"2. Whether or not proceedings before the Ombudsman was tainted with ill motives amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction; <br><br>"3. Whether or not the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction when it granted an immunity to Ms. Atos to become a state witness on almost the same date the Affidavit was executed and submitted; <br><br>"4. Whether or not the Ombudsman erred in singling out petitioner for criminal prosecution amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction; <br><br>"5. Whether or not the Ombudsman erred in giving weight to the Affidavit dated 18 February 1999 of Ms. Atos despite an earlier affidavit which totally contradicts her averments therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Court's Ruling</span> <br></div><br>The Petition is unmeritorious. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">First Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Finding of Probable Cause</span> <br></div><br>Probable cause is defined as such facts and circumstances that would engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34] </sup> Its determination during a preliminary investigation is a function left to the government prosecutor, which in this case is the OMB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35] </sup> As a rule, the courts do not interfere with the OMB's exercise of discretion in determining probable cause unless there are compelling reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36] </sup> This policy is based on constitutional, statutory and practical considerations. The Constitution and RA 6770 (the Ombudsman Act of 1989) grants the OMB with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutorial powers that is virtually free from executive, legislative or judicial intervention, in order to insulate it from outside pressure and improper influence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <br><br>However, there are certain instances when this Court may intervene in the prosecution of cases.<span style="font-style: italic;">  Brocka v. Enrile</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> cited some of these exceptions, as follows:  (1) when necessary to afford adequate protection to the constitutional rights of the accused; (2) when necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions; (3) when there is a prejudicial question which is sub judice; (4)  when the acts of the officer are without or in excess of authority; (5) where the prosecution is under an invalid law, ordinance or regulation; (6) when double jeopardy is clearly apparent; (7) where the court has no jurisdiction over the offense; (8) where it is a case of persecution rather than prosecution; (9) where the charges are manifestly false and motivated by the lust for vengeance; and (10) when there is clearly no <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case against the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has been denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39] </sup> <br><br>The remedy to challenge the OMB's orders or resolutions in criminal cases is through a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40] </sup><br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Grave Abuse of Discretion</span><br></div><br>A petition for certiorari is the remedy when a government officer has acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]  </sup> <br><br>Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  The exercise of power must have been done in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility.  It must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Petitioner theorizes that the OMB resolved the Complaint against him for reasons other than the merits of the case.  He specifically charges HLURB Commissioner Teresita Desierto, the spouse of Ombudsman Desierto, as the "unseen hand" behind the filing of the criminal cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  Commissioner Desierto allegedly harbored resentment against him for signing a Manifesto<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> issued by some lawyers in the HLURB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup>  He also recalls Commissioner Desierto threatening him if he did not resign from the HLURB.  Thus, he concludes that the proceedings before the OMB were tainted with ill motives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47] </sup><br><br>We cannot accept petitioner's arguments.  The Court observes that his arguments are merely conjectures bereft of any proof.  He presented absolutely no evidence of any irregularity in the proceedings before the OMB.  There was no showing that Commissioner Desierto interfered in any manner in the proceedings before the OMB.  Other than petitioner's bare assertions, there was also no proof that Commissioner Desierto bore a grudge against Pontejos.   <br><br>Petitioner failed to substantiate his allegation of grave abuse of discretion.  On the other hand, there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of probable cause.  Evidence presented during the preliminary investigation engender a well-founded belief that crimes have been committed and that Pontejos is probably guilty thereof for which he should be held for trial.  The Court is therefore precluded from interfering in the OMB's discretion to file the criminal cases against petitioner.  To be sure, great respect must be accorded to the OMB's exercise of its constitutionally mandated functions.  Unless clearly shown to have been issued with grave abuse of discretion, these judgments are not interfered with. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Second Issue:</span><br></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Immunity from Prosecution</span> <br></div><br>The decision on whether to prosecute and whom to indict is executive in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>  It is the prosecution that could essentially determine the strength of pursuing a case against an accused.  The prosecutorial powers include the discretion of granting immunity to an accused in exchange for testimony against another.  Thus, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapa v. Sandiganbayan</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> explained:  <br><blockquote>"The decision to grant immunity from prosecution forms a constituent part of the prosecution process. It is essentially a tactical decision to forego prosecution of a person for government to achieve a higher objective. It is a deliberate renunciation of the right of the State to prosecute all who appear to be guilty of having committed a crime. Its justification lies in the particular need of the State to obtain the conviction of the more guilty criminals who, otherwise, will probably elude the long arm of the law. Whether or not the delicate power should be exercised, who should be extended the privilege, the timing of its grant, are questions addressed solely to the sound judgment of the prosecution. The power to prosecute includes the right to determine who shall be prosecuted and the corollary right to decide whom not to prosecute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>It is constitutionally permissible for Congress to vest the prosecutor with the power to determine who can qualify as a witness and be granted immunity from prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51] </sup> Noteworthy, there are many laws that allow government investigators and prosecutors to grant immunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52] </sup> In relation to this, the Court has previously upheld the discretion of the Department of Justice (DOJ),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53] </sup>Commission on Elections (Comelec),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54] </sup>and the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55] </sup>to grant immunity from prosecution on the basis of the respective laws that vested them with such power. <br><br>The OMB was also vested with the power to grant immunity from prosecution, thus:<br><blockquote>"SEC.  17.    x x x. <br><br>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Under such terms and conditions as it may determine</span>, taking into account the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Ombudsman may grant immunity </span>from criminal prosecution to any person whose testimony or whose possession and production of documents or other evidence may be necessary to determine the truth in any hearing, inquiry or proceeding being conducted by the Ombudsman or under its authority, in the performance or in the furtherance of its constitutional functions and statutory objectives.  x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>According to Pontejos, the OMB's authority to grant immunity is subject to the "pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court."  He claims that the procedural rules allow the discharge of an accused as state witness only upon conformity of the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57] </sup> An information against the accused must first be filed in court prior to the discharge.  Moreover, the prosecution could only recommend and propose, but not grant immunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>  <br> <br>The pertinent provision of the Rules of Court reads:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 17.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Discharge of accused to be state witness</span>. – When two or more persons are jointly charged with the commission of any offense, upon motion of the prosecution before resting its case, the court may direct one or more of the accused to be discharged with their consent so that they may be witnesses for the state when after requiring the prosecution to present evidence and the sworn statement of each proposed state witness at a hearing in support of the discharge, the court is satisfied that:<br><blockquote>'(a) There is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused whose discharge is requested;<br><br>'(b) There is no other direct evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of said accused; <br><br>'(c) The testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated in its material points; <br><br>'(d) Said accused does not appear to be the most guilty; and <br><br>'(e) Said accused has not at any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude.<br></blockquote>'Evidence adduced in support of the discharge shall automatically form part of the trial.  If the court denies the motion for discharge of the accused as state witness, his sworn statement shall be inadmissible in evidence.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court has already held that this provision is applicable only to cases already filed in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60] </sup> The trial court is given the power to discharge an accused as a state witness only because it has already acquired jurisdiction over the crime and the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61] </sup> <br> <br>As stated earlier, the power to choose who to discharge as state witness is an executive function.  Essentially, it is not a judicial prerogative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]  </sup>The fact that an individual had not been previously charged or included in an information does not prevent the prosecution from utilizing said person as a witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Section 17 of the Ombudsman Act requires conformity with the Rules of Court.  Accordingly, this should be read as requiring the following circumstances prior to the discharge: (1) absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused sought to be discharged; (2) no direct evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed except the testimony of the said accused; (3) the testimony of the said accused can be substantially corroborated in its material points; (4) said accused does not appear to be most guilty; and (5) said accused has not any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude.   <br><br>Indeed, there must be a standard to follow in the exercise of the prosecutor's discretion.  The decision to grant immunity cannot be made capriciously.  Should there be unjust favoritism, the Court may exercise its certiorari power. <br><br>In the present case, certiorari is not proper.  Pontejos' allegations do not show, much less allege, grave abuse of discretion in the granting of immunity to Atos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>   The OMB considered Atos' position, record and involvement in the case prior to the discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]  </sup> <br><br>Pontejos also claims that he was not furnished a copy of Atos' Affidavit that connected him to the crimes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66] </sup>  Since he was not afforded the opportunity to challenge the assertions in said Affidavit, his right to due process had allegedly been violated. <br><br>The alleged denial of due process is controverted by the facts.  It appears from the records that Pontejos eventually received a copy of the aforementioned Affidavit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>  More importantly, he had challenged the Affidavit in his Motion for Reinvestigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and request for reconsideration of the Review and Recommendation of the Overall Deputy Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69] </sup> Pontejos' contention must necessarily fail because --  as shown -- he had the opportunity to be heard and in fact, availed of it. <br><br>As a final note, Pontejos has made it appear that the criminal cases filed against him were based on ill motives.  His arguments challenge the evidence gathered.  It is readily apparent that these arguments should be raised as defenses during the trial, not in the present Petition. <br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">DENIED</span>.

Desierto made unfounded accusations and sweeping statements branding the lawyers and staff of the Appeals and Review Group, the Expanded National Capital Region, the Legal Services Group, and Regional Field Office 4 as corrupt.  She alleged that lawyers, legal assistants and para-legal assistants receive bribes and ask party litigants to treat them to lunch.<br><br>"The Honorable Commissioner may not have foreseen the possible repercus[s]ions of her words.  She may not have known that the accusations made by her tend to bring not only the legal staff into disrepute but the whole Board.<br><br>"The statements of the Honorable Commissioner tend to destroy public confidence in the Board.  Hence, they degrade not only the lawyers, legal assistants and para-legal assistants but all employees of the Board.<br><br>"The Honorable Commissioner may not have realized it, but once public confidence in the Board is destroyed, the Board loses its usefulness.<br><br>"It is regrettable that such irresponsible act was committed by a high ranking official of the Board, a person who should be the first to protect the Board and its dignity.<br><br>"We have been subjected to snide remarks and slanderous statements before, but we took them in stride, because they are unsubstantiated and utterly false.  However, when the same unproven accusations are made by a responsible superior, who is also a lawyer, we believe that we have to react.  We have suffered in silence for too long.<br><br>"It appears that our continued silence is being interpreted as an admission of guilt.  To correct such misinterpretation, we now speak out and ask that instead of humiliating all lawyers in public, cases against erring officials and employees be instituted before the proper forum.<br><br>"We fervently hope that there will be no repetition of the sorry incident.  We hope that the architects, the engineers, the planners and the rest of the technical staff will not suffer the same fate.  We pray that the rest of the employees won't have to endure the same indignity."
