				<H3>PARTIDO NG MANGGAGAWA (PM) AND BUTIL FARMERS PARTY (BUTIL), PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS (COMELEC), REPRESENTED BY ITS HON. CHAIRMAN   BENJAMIN ABALOS, SR., RESPONDENT. <BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The petition at bar involves the formula for computing the additional seats due, if any, for winners in party-list elections.<br><br>The antecedents are undisputed.<br><br>Several party-list participants sent queries to the respondent COMELEC regarding the formula to be adopted in computing the additional seats for the party-list winners in the May 10, 2004 elections. In response, the respondent Commission issued Resolution No. 6835, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> adopting the simplified formula of "one additional seat per additional two percent of the total party-list votes." The resolution reads:<br><blockquote>Considering that the simplified formula has long been the one adopted by the Commission and is now the formula of choice of the Supreme Court in its latest resolution on the matter, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Commission RESOLVED, as it hereby RESOLVES, to adopt the simplified formula of one additional seat per additional two percent of the total party-list votes in the proclamation of the party-list winners in the coming May 10, 2004 National and Local Elections.</span> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (<span style="font-style: italic;">emphasis supplied</span>)<br></blockquote>In finding that this simplified formula is the "formula of choice of the Supreme Court," respondent Commission quoted the memorandum of Commissioner Mehol K. Sadain, Commissioner-In-Charge for Party-List concerns, viz:<br><blockquote>By way of review, following is a highlight of the legal discourse on the two [percent] vote requirement for the party-list system and the corollary issue on additional seat allocation.<br><br>Section 11(b) and Section 12 of R.A. 7941 (Party-List System Act) provide that "the parties, organizations, and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;coalitions receiving at least two percent (2%) of the total votes cast for the party-list system shall be entitled to one seat each, provided that those garnering more than two percent (2%) of the votes shall be entitled to additional seats in proportion to their total number of votes xxx.&nbsp; The COMELEC shall tally all the votes for the parties, organizations, or coalitions on a nationwide basis, rank them according to the number of votes received and allocate party-list representatives proportionately according to the percentage of votes obtained by each party, organization or coalition as against the total nationwide votes cast for the party-list system."<br><br>These provisions of [the] statute were transformed into the following formulas by the Supreme Court in Veterans Federation Party vs. COMELEC (G.R. Nos. 136781, 136786 &amp; 136795, October 6, 2000).<br><br>For the party-list candidate garnering the highest number of votes, the following formula was adopted:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"><td align="left" width="35%">Number of votes of first party&nbsp; </td><td align="left" width="35%">Proportion of votes of first </td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>-------------------------------------- &nbsp; = </td><td>party relative to total votes </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>Total votes for party-list system </td><td>for the party-list system </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>And for the additional seats of other parties who reached the required two percent mark, the following formula applies:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"><td align="left" width="30%"><br>Additional seats<br>for concerned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =<br>party<br></td><td align="left" width="35%">No. of votes of<br>concerned party<br>------------------------ x<br> No. of votes of first&nbsp; party<br></td><td align="left" width="35%"><br>No. of additional<br>seats allocated to<br>the first party</td> </tr></tbody></table><br>The applicability of these formulas was reiterated in the June 25, 2003 Resolution of the Supreme Court in Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party vs. COMELEC, et al. (G.R. No. 147589) and Bayan Muna vs. COMELEC, et al. (G.R. No. 147613) penned by Justice Artemio Panganiban, wherein the Court declared that party-list BUHAY was not entitled to an additional seat even if it garnered 4.46 [percent] of the total party-list votes, contrary to BUHAY's contention which was based on the COMELEC simplified formula of one additional seat per an additional two percent of the total party-list votes.<br><br>However, on November 10, 2003, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Supreme Court promulgated a Resolution in the same case, this time penned by Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr., granting BUHAY's motion for reconsideration of the June 25, 2003 Resolution, to wit:<br><blockquote>It is thus established in the Resolution of 25 June 2003 that, like APEC, BUTIL, CIBAC and AKBAYAN, BUHAY had obtained more than four percent (4%) of the total number of votes validly cast for the party-list system and obtained more than 0.50 for the additional seats.&nbsp; Accordingly, just like the first four whose additional nominees are now holding office as member of the House of Representatives, BUHAY should be declared entitled to one additional seat.</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effectively, the Supreme Court, with Justices Jose Vitug and Panganiban registering separate opinions, adopted the simplified COMELEC formula of one additional seat per additional two percent of the total party-list votes garnered when it declared BUHAY entitled to one additional seat and proceeded to order the COMELEC to proclaim BUHAY's second nominee</span>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<span style="font-style: italic;">emphasis supplied</span>)<br></blockquote>Party-List Canvass Report No. 20 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> showed that the total number of votes cast for all the party-list participants in the May 10, 2004 elections was 12,721,952 and the following parties, organizations and coalitions received at least two percent (2%) of the total votes cast for the party-list system, to wit:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#cccccc" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"><td style="text-align: center;" width="5%">Rank </td><td style="text-align: center;" width="45%">Party-List Group </td><td style="text-align: center;" width="25%">Votes Received </td><td style="text-align: center;" width="25%">Percentage to Total Votes Cast (%) </td> </tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>1 </td><td>Bayan Muna (BAYAN MUNA) </td><td style="text-align: center;">1,203,305 </td><td style="text-align: center;">9.4585 </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>2 </td><td>Association of Philippine Electric Cooperatives (APEC) </td><td style="text-align: center;">934,995 </td><td style="text-align: center;">7.3495 </td></tr><tr bgcolor="#ffffff"><td>3 </td><td>Akbayan!

(<span style="font-style: italic;">emphasis supplied</span>)<br></blockquote>Pursuant to the Constitution's mandate, Congress enacted R.A. No. 7941, also known as the "Party-List System Act," to "promote proportional representation in the election of representatives to the House of Representatives through a party-list system."&nbsp; The law provides as follows:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Section 11. <span style="font-style: italic;">Number of Party-List Representatives.</span>— xxx<br><br></div>In determining the allocation of seats for the second vote, the following procedure shall be observed:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">(a) The parties, organizations, and coalitions shall be ranked from the highest to the lowest based on the number of votes they garnered during the elections.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(b) The parties, organizations, and coalitions receiving at least two percent (2%) of the total votes cast for the party-list system shall be entitled to one seat each: </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Provided,</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> That those garnering more than two percent (2%) of the votes shall be entitled to additional seats in the proportion of their total number of votes:&nbsp; Provided, finally, That each party, organization, or coalition shall be entitled to not more than three (3) seats.</span><br><br>Section 12.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Procedure in Allocating Seats for Party-List Representatives.</span>— <span style="font-weight: bold;">The COMELEC shall tally all the votes for the parties, organizations, or coalitions on a nationwide basis, rank them according to the number of votes received and allocate party-list representatives proportionately according to the percentage of votes obtained by each party, organization, or coalition as against the total nationwide votes cast for the party-list system</span>. (<span style="font-style: italic;">emphases supplied</span>)<br></blockquote>These provisions on the party-list system were put to test in the May 11, 1998 elections.&nbsp; In the landmark case of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Veterans</span>, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> several petitions for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span>, prohibition and <span style="font-style: italic;">mandamus</span>, with prayers for the issuance of temporary restraining orders or writs of preliminary injunction, were filed by some parties and organizations that had obtained at least two percent of the total party-list votes cast in the May 11, 1998 party-list elections, against COMELEC and 38 other parties, organizations and coalitions which had been declared by COMELEC as entitled to party-list seats in the House of Representatives.&nbsp; &nbsp;The following issues were raised: 1) whether the twenty percent constitutional allocation is mandatory;&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; whether the two percent threshold requirement and the three-seat limit under Section 11(b) of R.A. No. 7941 is constitutional; and 3) how the additional seats of a qualified party should be determined.&nbsp; In said case, the Court set the "four inviolable parameters" of the party-list system under the Constitution and R.A. No. 7941, to wit:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">First, the twenty percent allocation</span> — the combined number of all party-list congressmen shall not exceed twenty percent of the total membership of the House of Representatives, including those elected under the party list.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second, the two percent threshold </span>— only those parties garnering a minimum of two percent of the total valid votes cast for the party-list system are "qualified" to have a seat in the House of Representatives.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third, the three-seat limit</span> — each qualified party, regardless of the number of votes it actually obtained, is entitled to a maximum of three seats; that is, one "qualifying" and two additional seats.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fourth, proportional representation&nbsp;</span>— the additional seats which a qualified party is entitled to shall be computed "in proportion to their total number of votes."<br><br>Likewise, the Court spelled out the formula for allocating the seats for party-list winners, thus:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Step One.&nbsp;</span> There is no dispute among the petitioners, the public and the private respondents, as well as the members of this Court, that the initial step is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">rank all the participating parties, organizations and coalitions from the highest to the lowest based on the number of votes they each received.</span>&nbsp; Then the ratio for each party is computed by dividing its votes by the total votes cast for all the parties participating in the system.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">All parties with at least two percent of the total votes are guaranteed one seat each.&nbsp; Only these parties shall be considered in the computation of additional seats.&nbsp; The party receiving the highest number of votes shall thenceforth be referred to as the "first" party.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Step Two.&nbsp;</span> The next step is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">determine the number of seats the first party is entitled</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">to</span>, in order to be able to compute that for the other parties.&nbsp; Since the distribution is based on proportional representation, the number of seats to be allotted to the other parties cannot possibly exceed that to which the first party is entitled by virtue of its obtaining the most number of votes.<br><br>x x x<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, how do we determine the number of seats the first party is entitled to?&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; The formula x x x is as follows:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br><table style="width: 435px; height: 94px;" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#ffffff" valign="top"><td style="font-weight: bold;" align="left" width="35%">Number of votes<br>of first party<br>--------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;=<br>Total votes for<br>Party-list system</td><td style="font-weight: bold;" align="left" width="35%"><br>Proportion of votes of<br>first party relative to<br>total votes for party-list system<br></td> </tr></tbody></table></span><br>If the proportion of votes received by the first party without rounding it off is equal to at least six percent of the total valid votes cast for all the party list groups, then the first party shall be entitled to two additional seats or a total of three seats overall.&nbsp;

Accordingly, just like the first four whose additional nominees are now holding office as member of the House of Representatives, BUHAY should be declared entitled to additional seat. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In light of all these antecedents, we deny the petition.<br><br>The formula in the landmark case of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Veterans</span> prevails.<br></blockquote></div><span style="font-weight: bold;">First,</span> the June 25, 2003 Resolution of the Court in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ang Bagong Bayani </span>referred to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Veterans</span> case in determining the number of seats due for the party-list winners.&nbsp; The footnote on said resolution in computing the additional seats for the party-list winners states:&nbsp; "[f]or a discussion of how to compute <span style="font-style: italic;">additional</span> nominees for parties other than the <span style="font-style: italic;">first, see Veterans</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, at pp. 280-282. x x x." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> &nbsp;The Court likewise held that:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">We also take this opportunity to emphasize that the formulas devised in Veterans for computing the number of nominees that the party-list winners are entitled to cannot be disregarded </span>by the concerned agencies of government, especially the Commission on Elections.&nbsp;

Well to note, the grant of an additional seat to BUHAY was <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">pro hac vice</span>, thus:<br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, the Court hereby RESOLVES, <span style="font-style: italic;
