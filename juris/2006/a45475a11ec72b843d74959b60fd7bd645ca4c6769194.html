CV No. 52626.&nbsp; Likewise sought to be reviewed is the Resolution dated July 18, 2001 of the appellate court denying the petitioner's motion for partial reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Factual and Procedural Antecedents</span><br></div><br>Some time in 1990, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo, Aklan, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) thereof a complaint for declaration of ownership and quieting of title to land with prayer for preliminary injunction against the Municipality of Buruanga, Aklan.&nbsp; The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 4164 and raffled to Branch 1 of the said RTC.<br><br>The complaint alleged, among others, that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo is the lawful owner and possessor of a parcel of residential and commercial land (Cadastral Lot No. 138) located at the <span style="font-style: italic;">poblacion</span> of the Municipality of Buruanga, Aklan.&nbsp; The said lot, with an area of 9,545 square meters, is a block bounded by four streets on all sides.&nbsp; It is more particularly described as follows:<br><blockquote>A parcel of commercial and residential land known as Cadastral Lot No. 138, GSS-06-00012, located at Poblacion, Buruanga, Aklan, containing an area of NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY- FIVE (9,545) SQUARE METERS, more or less. Bounded on the North by Viven Ostan Street; on the East by the Provincial Road; on the South by Nitoy Sualog Street; and on the West by Emilio Ostan Street, and declared for taxation purposes in the name of the Roman Catholic Church, Buruanga, Aklan, under Tax Declaration No. 6339 (1985) and assessed at P23,850.00, including the improvements thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>In 1894, the Roman Catholic Church was built in the middle portion of the said lot and has been in existence since then up to the present.<br><br>The complaint further alleged that some time in 1978,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Municipality of Buruanga constructed its municipal building on the northeastern portion of the subject lot after it obtained the permission of Fr. Jesus Patiño, then parish priest of Buruanga.&nbsp; The municipality promised to remove all the improvements it constructed thereon if and when the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo needed the said land.<br><br>In October 1989, the said municipal building was razed by fire allegedly perpetrated by members of the New People's Army.&nbsp; On November 25, 1989, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo, through its counsel, wrote to the Municipal Mayor of Buruanga requesting the officials of the said municipality to refrain from constructing its new building on the same site because it is the property of the church.&nbsp; Further, it needed the said land for its social action projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; The letter reads in part:<br><blockquote>I am writing you on behalf of my client THE ROMAN CATHOLIC BISHOP OF KALIBO, AKLAN, a corporation sole and represented by Bishop Juan N. Nilmar requesting you and the Honorable Members of the Municipal Council (Sangguniang Bayan) to refrain from constructing your new Municipal Building on the same site where your old Municipal Building was burned down because it is constructed on the property of the Church.<br><br>Please be informed that the land of the Church is needed for its social action projects and additional building, hence, kindly relocate your New Municipal Building in your own land located along Emilio Ostan Street, known as Cadastral Lot No. 87.<br><br>With respect to your other public buildings such as the Rural Hospital, Buruanga Community Medicare Hospital, the Basketball Court and the Grandstand which are all occupying the Church property, you can continue using the same land subject to your recognition of the true ownership of the property of the Church — The Roman Catholic Church — of Buruanga, Aklan, under the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo, Aklan, the lawful administrator of all church properties in the Province of Aklan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>On March 12, 1990, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo wrote the Department of Public Works and Highways of the said province requesting the said office not to issue any building permit to the Municipal Mayor and/or the Municipality of Buruanga in connection with the construction of its municipal building on the land owned by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>These letters went unheeded as the construction of the new municipal building on the same site proceeded.&nbsp; Consequently, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo filed the complaint <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> and prayed that it be declared the lawful owner and possessor of Lot 138.&nbsp; It likewise prayed that a temporary restraining order be issued to enjoin the said municipality and its authorized representatives from constructing the new municipal building thereon and that the latter be directed to pay damages to the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo.<br><br>In its Answer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7] </sup>the Municipality of Buruanga, represented by Mayor Protacio Obrique, denied that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo ever acquired ownership and possession over the land subject of the complaint.&nbsp; It raised as affirmative defenses that the said lot was surveyed as property of the municipality on February 3, 1909 in accordance with Section 58 of Act 926 by A.W. Bushell and approved by the Bureau of Lands on May 15, 1909.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8] </sup>Thereafter, a decree was issued on March 14, 1919 in favor of the Municipality of Buruanga under Case No. 12871 of then Court of Land Registration, Bureau of Lands.<br><br>It was further alleged that the said land was again surveyed in the name of the Municipality of Buruanga under Act No. 2259 and denominated as Lot No. 138 GSS-06-00012 from the approved cadastral map and that the said municipality alone had possessed the said land under the claim of title exclusively for over fifty (50) years, exclusive of all other rights and adverse to all other claimants.<br><br>The Municipality of Buruanga urged the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> to dismiss the complaint and, instead, declare it the absolute and exclusive owner of the disputed lot.<br><br>On November 29, 1990, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> issued the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> appointing Geodetic Engineer Rodrigo Santiago of the Bureau of Lands as Commissioner and directing him to identify and delineate the lot in question.<br><br>In compliance therewith, Engr.

Jesus Patiño<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> stating that he was the one who gave verbal permission to then Municipal Mayor Pedro Omugtong to construct the municipal building on the vacant lot owned by the church was not accorded any evidentiary value because he (Fr. Patiño) did not testify during the trial.<br><br>On the other hand, the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> did not give credence to the Municipality of Buruanga's Exhibit "1," a microfilm enlargement of a plan showing that the land consisting of 12,615 square meters was subject of Land Registration Case No. 12871.&nbsp; The plan showed that the survey was approved on May 15, 1909 and the notations therein indicated that a decree was issued on March 14, 1919.&nbsp; But no such decree was shown.&nbsp; It was further found by the court a quo that the plan was requested from the Bureau of Lands Survey Division on December 22, 1976.&nbsp; However, the same was not duly certified by the issuing government agency.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even assuming that the disputed lot was indeed subject of a land registration proceeding and a decree had been issued therefor in March 1919, the Municipality of Buruanga, despite lapse of decades, failed to take the necessary judicial steps for the issuance of a title in its name based on the decree.&nbsp; Neither did it take any other course of action that would render its title thereto indefeasible.<br><br>The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>, however, gave probative weight to the testimony of Manuel Sualog, Chief of the Lands Management Section of the Department of Environment and National Resources, who was presented by the Municipality of Buruanga.&nbsp; Sualog testified that the disputed lot was the public plaza of the said municipality.&nbsp; Standing thereon are the Roman Catholic Church and its parish house, the new municipal hall, the rural health center, the barangay community hospital and a basketball court.<br><br>During the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo's</span> ocular inspection conducted on May 7, 1992, the town was celebrating its town fiesta.&nbsp; It observed that the public was using the whole plaza (in Lots 138-A and 138-C) for the festivities.&nbsp; Also, the existence of the health centers, basketball court and the municipal hall showed that portions of the disputed lot were being used by the public.<br><br>Upon inspection of the church, the court a quo further observed that it was indeed an old stone structure and probably built in 1894, the year carved on its left side entrance.&nbsp; It described the church as "vintage turn-of-the century colonial Filipino church architecture.&nbsp; Moss and ficus grow out of its wall crevices.&nbsp; The age of the church shows that it has been occupying that particular space for almost one hundred (100) years long enough for the plaintiff to have possessed it in the concept of owner continuously, adversely and publicly against the whole world."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> held that the facts of the present case were similar to those in <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty v. Municipality of Victoria,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> where the Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>For the above reasons, x x x it should be held, as we do hereby hold, that the whole of the land not occupied by the church of the town of Victoria and its parish house, is a public plaza of said town, of public use and that in consequence thereof, the defendant is absolved of the complaint without any special ruling as to the costs of both instances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo's</span> decision reads:<br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li> The Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo, Aklan, is declared the lawful owner and possessor of Lot 138-B with an area of 3,836 square meters in the Commissioner's Report as against the defendant;<br><br></li><li> Defendant Municipality of Buruanga is declared the lawful owner and possessor of Lot 138-A with an area of 2,319 square meters and Lot 138-C with an area of 3,389 square meters in the Commissioner's Report, said lots being public plaza destined for public use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote>The Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo seasonably filed its appeal with the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; It sought the reversal of that portion of the court a quo's judgment adjudicating the ownership of Lots 138-A and 138-C to the Municipality of Buruanga.<br><br>During the pendency of the case in the appellate court, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo moved to submit additional evidence to support its claim of ownership over the entire Lot 138.&nbsp; The additional evidence consisted of affidavits of old residents of Buruanga stating that the municipal building was constructed on the disputed lot only in the late 1950's.&nbsp; Prior thereto, the municipal building stood at a place called Sunset Park, a block totally different from the disputed lot.&nbsp; The said motion was denied by the appellate court on the ground that the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo had already been accorded full opportunity to present its evidence in the court a quo.<br><br>The Municipality of Buruanga did not file its appellee's brief with the CA.&nbsp; On January 31, 2001, the appellate court rendered the assailed Decision affirming with modification the decision of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span>.&nbsp; The CA affirmed the ownership of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo over Lot 138-B but reversed the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo's</span> ruling relative to the ownership of Lots 138-A and 138-C.&nbsp; The appellate court declared the said lots property of public dominion, hence, not owned by either of the parties.<br><br>The CA stated that the court a quo correctly relied on the ruling in Harty, which was reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bishop of Calbayog v. Director of Lands</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> where the Court held that the public plaza and public thoroughfare were not subject to registration by the church.&nbsp; In the latter case, it was ruled that since neither the Church nor the municipality presented positive proof of ownership or exclusive possession for an appreciable period of time, and the only indubitable fact was the free and continuous use of the lot in question by the residents of the town, which had no other public plaza to speak of other than the disputed lot, there was a strong presumption that the same had been segregated as a public plaza upon the founding of the municipality therein.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, the appellate court reversed that portion of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo's</span> judgment declaring the Municipality of Buruanga as the owner of Lots 138-A and 138-C which form part of the public plaza.&nbsp; Citing Articles 419<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21] </sup>and 420<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22] </sup>of the Civil Code, the appellate court classified these lots as property of public dominion; hence, not susceptible to private ownership by the Municipality of Buruanga.&nbsp; The said lots are merely under its jurisdiction and administration.&nbsp; Being intended for the common and public welfare, they could not be appropriated either by the State or by private persons.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the assailed CA decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, upon the premises, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that Lots 138-A and 138-C are declared property of public dominion not owned by either of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>The Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo moved for a partial reconsideration of the appellate court's ruling that Lots 138-A and 138-C, being the public plaza, are property of public dominion.&nbsp; The Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo averred that the appellate court erred in affirming the finding of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> that these lots comprise the public plaza.&nbsp; It maintained that it owned the entire Lot 138.<br><br>The appellate court denied the motion for partial reconsideration, hence, the recourse to this Court by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Kalibo (the petitioner).<br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Petitioner's Arguments</span><br></div><br>The present petition for review on certiorari alleges that:<br><blockquote>I. THE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN RELYING UPON THE CASES OF HARTY V. MUNICIPALITY OF VICTORIA, TARLAC (13 Phil. 152 [1909]) and BISHOP OF CALBAYOG V. DIRECTOR OF LANDS (45 SCRA 418 [1972]) TO SUPPORT ITS CONCLUSION THAT THE PETITIONER IS NOT THE OWNER OF LOTS 138-A AND 138-C.<br><br>II. THE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING THAT LOTS 138-A AND 138-C [WHICH ARE WITHIN THE ORIGINAL LOT 138] ARE PROPERTIES OF THE PUBLIC [DOMAIN] AND NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP BY THE PETITIONER.<br><br>III. THE COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THAT PETITIONER'S OWNERSHIP OF THE ENTIRE LOT 138 WAS GRANTED AND RECOGNIZED UNDER SPANISH LAW, AND AFFIRMED IN THE TREATY OF PARIS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner clarifies that it is seeking a partial review of the appellate court's Decision dated January 31, 2001 classifying Lots 138-A and 138-C as property of public dominion and not susceptible to private ownership and that the petitioner is not entitled to the possession and ownership thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not contesting the portion of the CA decision upholding its ownership over Lot 138-B.<br><br>The petitioner opines that the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty</span>, relied upon by the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> and the CA to hold that Lots 138-A and 138-C comprise the public plaza, are inapplicable because the facts therein are not similar to those of the present case.&nbsp; The petitioner points out that the public plaza referred to in <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty</span> was the lot <span style="font-style: italic;">across</span> the street from the church lot.&nbsp; It was not referring to the land surrounding the Catholic church and the convent of the town of Victoria, which was bounded by streets on each of its four sides. Thus, when the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty</span> limited the ownership of the church to the land "<span style="font-style: italic;">occupied by the church of the town of Victoria and its parish house,</span>" it was not confining the ownership to a portion of the lot on which the church and parish house were situated.&nbsp; Rather, the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty</span> referred to the entire lot or block (bounded by a street on each of the four sides) on which the church and its parish house were erected.<br><br>The petitioner asserts that the following facts that have been established support its claim of ownership over the entire Lot 138 as against the claim of the Municipality of Buruanga (respondent municipality):<br><blockquote>[a] The church is built in the middle of Lot 138 (which is now Lot 138-B).&nbsp; It was built therein in 1894.&nbsp; The church was almost 100 years old (at the time the case was instituted with the trial court in 1990).&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[b] The Municipality of Buruanga is an old municipality constituted or created during the colonial period, when the Philippine Islands was under the Spanish sovereignty.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[c] No building was built on Lot 138 earlier than or at about the same time as the church.&nbsp; No municipal building was built around the church for many decades after 1894.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[d] The municipal hall of Buruanga was built on what is now Lot 138-A only in the late 1950's.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[e] It was not controverted by the private respondent that then Mayor Omugtong of Buruanga sought and obtained the permission of the then parish priest, Fr. Jesus Patino, to allow the municipal government to build its municipal hall on Lot 138-A in the late 1950's only.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[f] No evidence was adduced by private respondent that it had obtained title of Lot 138-A or 138-C from the church (the owner of these lots) or that its possession of any portion of Lot 138 was adverse to that of the church.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[g] When the municipal hall was burned down by the NPA rebels in 1989 the church asked the municipal government to relocate the municipal hall elsewhere since it (church) needed the lot for itself.<br><br>[h] Because the municipal government resisted and for the first time exhibited a possession adverse to the church, the petitioner promptly filed the instant suit before the lower court for quieting of title to the subject lot (the entire Lot 138) and to be declared the owner of such property.<br><br>[i] The church has been in continuous, open, adverse, notorious possession of the entire Lot 138 in the concept of owner since at least 1894 until the late 1950's.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[j]&nbsp; No evidence has been shown that Lots 138-A and 138-C were devoted for public use or for use as a public plaza before 1894 or even at about the time the church was built on Lot 138.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[k] The only evidence as to the supposed character of Lot 138-C as a public plaza is a survey plan allegedly approved on 15 May 1909 denominated as [GSS]-06-00012, Buruanga Settlement Project, approved only in 1984.&nbsp; Petitioner was not notified of this survey.&nbsp; x x x<br><br>[l] The real property tax declaration presented by private respondent to establish its supposed possession (Exhs. 4, 4-a, and 4-b, Record, pages 45-47) covered the year 1992 only.<br><br>[m] Witness Jaime S.

The alleged import of this admission is that the entire Lot 138 (designated as Lot 1 in Exhibit "1") was assigned solely to the church since a different lot was assigned to respondent municipality.<br><br>The petitioner avers that Buruanga is an ancient Spanish town and that when it was created the Spanish authorities assigned a distinct and separate lot for its municipal government or <span style="font-style: italic;">pueblo</span> where it could build its municipal hall or <span style="font-style: italic;">casa real</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could thus be assumed that the <span style="font-style: italic;">casa real</span> of respondent municipality would be built at about the same time as the church or around 1894.&nbsp; The petitioner contends that nothing in the evidence suggests that the <span style="font-style: italic;">casa real</span> was built on Lot 138 during the said period.&nbsp; It was only in the late 1950's that the municipal hall was built thereon upon the permission granted by the parish priest.<br><br>Refuting respondent municipality's view that it is unthinkable that the church would be given a bigger property than the municipal government, the petitioner submits that such notion is not far fetched considering that the primary aim of the Spaniards at the time was to spread the Catholic faith to the colonies.<br><br>That the entire Lot 138 belonged to the petitioner is allegedly supported by the practice during the Spanish period, as shown by the layout of the church convent and church plaza in practically all the old towns in the Philippines and the early cases[28] decided by the Court, to invariably provide the church with spacious grounds bounded by the four principal streets of the town.<br><br>Even without any document or certificate of title thereto, the petitioner bases its claim of ownership over Lot 138 under the Spanish Law as recognized and affirmed under the Treaty of Paris.&nbsp; It cites <span style="font-style: italic;">Roman Catholic Apostolic Church v. Municipality of Placer</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> where the Court recognized that the church is entitled not only to possession of its properties but to ownership thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Bishop of Jaro</span> was again invoked by the petitioner as the Court explained therein that it did not find it strange that the church was unable to exhibit a written title to its property since the Laws of the Indies in force during the Spanish regime dictated the layout of the towns and assigned the locations of the church, square and government administration buildings.&nbsp; The provisions of the Laws of the Indies pertaining thereto were held to be sufficient to secure the registration in the name of the church of its land.<br><br>The petitioner asserts that even granting <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that Lot 138 was not assigned to it during the Spanish regime or is not owned by it pursuant to the Laws of the Indies, still, it had acquired <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso jure</span> or by operation of law a government grant, a vested title, to the disputed lot by virtue of its open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation thereof since 1894.&nbsp;&nbsp; In support of this contention, the petitioner cites Subsection 6 of Section 54 of Act No. 926, which became effective on July 26, 1904, and which provided that:<br><blockquote>6. All persons who by themselves or their predecessors in interest have been in the open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, as defined by said Act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and two, under a bona fide claim of ownership except as against the Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect of this Act, except when prevented by war or <span style="font-style: italic;">force majeure</span>, shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and to have received the same, and shall be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this chapter.<br></blockquote>It is allegedly clear that as early as July 26, 1904, when Act No. 926 took effect, the petitioner had already acquired a government grant, a vested title, to Lot 138.<br><br>Subsection b of Section 45 of Act No. 2874, approved on November 9, 1919, which amended Act No. 926, is similarly cited by the petitioner.&nbsp;

These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter.<br></blockquote>On the basis of the foregoing provisions, a land registration proceeding instituted would, according to the petitioner, "in truth be little more than a formality, at the most limited to ascertaining whether the possession claimed is of the required character and length of time, and registration thereunder would not confer title, but simply recognize a title already vested."<br><br>In addition to its arguments on the merits of the case, the petitioner assails the appellate court's denial of its motion to submit additional evidence which would have showed that the <span style="font-style: italic;">casa real</span> of respondent municipality, together with its plaza (Sunset Park Plaza), was located on a distinct lot (Lot 2) separated from Lot 138 by Emilio Ostan Street.<br><br>The petitioner urges the Court to reverse and set aside the portion of the appellate court's decision declaring Lots 138-A and 138-C as property of public dominion and to declare the petitioner the absolute owner of the entire Lot 138.&nbsp; In the alternative, the petitioner prays that it be allowed to submit additional evidence of its ownership over Lots 138-A and 138-C.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Respondent Municipality's Counter-arguments</span><br></div><br>For its part, respondent municipality contends that, except for the figures 1894 etched on the left wall of the church, the petitioner has not presented any evidence to show that it had continuous possession of the entire Lot 138 since the turn of the twentieth century.&nbsp;&nbsp; The petitioner is allegedly of the mistaken belief that because it possessed Lot 138-B, it must have likewise possessed Lots 138-A and 138-C.&nbsp; Respondent municipality claims that it is the one that has been exercising acts of exclusive ownership over the disputed lot.<br><br>The petitioner has allegedly misread <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bishop of Calbayog</span> in claiming that in cases involving the church, the lot adjudicated to it invariably consisted of the entire block, bounded by a street on each of the four sides, and the public plazas were situated in separate blocks.&nbsp; While it may true that many church properties occupy an entire block in certain municipalities, it is allegedly equally true that other church properties occupy only portions thereof depending on the exigencies of the locality at the time when the church was being established.<br><br>In those instances that the Court allegedly adjudicated an open space in favor of the church, the local government was not shown to have exercised dominion over the property and the church has consistently established some control over it, like the putting up of a religious monument thereon.&nbsp; On the other hand, in the present case, respondent municipality insists that it has laid adverse claim over Lot 138 as early as 1909 when it applied for title over it and was even issued a decree over the said lot.&nbsp; Respondent municipality places its actual, public and adverse possession of Lot 138 at the latest in 1958 when it built its old municipal hall on the said site.&nbsp; Its occupation prior thereto could also be allegedly presumed from its actual possession thereof.<br><br>The petitioner has allegedly failed to establish that the construction of the old municipal building in 1958 was by mere tolerance on its part. Respondent municipality harps on the failure of the petitioner to present as its witness Fr. Patiño, the parish priest who supposedly gave respondent municipality permission to construct its municipal building on the disputed lot. Respondent municipality denies ever seeking such permission.&nbsp; Further, the tax declaration (Exhibit "B") of the petitioner only pertained to Lot 138-B proving that its ownership was limited to the said lot and did not extend to Lots 138-A and 138-C.<br><br>Respondent municipality avers that it is already contented with the decision of the appellate court although the latter allegedly erred in concluding that Lots 138-A and 138-C are property of public dominion without taking into consideration that respondent municipality applied for the issuance of title covering the disputed lot and was issued a decree thereto in 1919.&nbsp; The admission of Mayor Obrique, during his testimony, that respondent municipality owned the lot along the beach (Lot 2) and situated across the street from Lot 138 could not be allegedly taken to mean that the Mayor was disclaiming ownership over Lot 138.<br><br>Respondent municipality theorizes that in those cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that the Court upheld the ownership of the church over a subject property, the same have ever since remained the property of the church and have been in its peaceful possession.&nbsp; Further, there were no adverse claimants and the primary issue being resolved was whether, despite non-compliance with procedural requirements, title may be granted in favor of the church.<br><br>Respondent municipality distinguishes the present case from those cases in that there is an open contest over the ownership and possession of Lots 138-A and 138-C and respondent municipality has in its favor actual and adverse possession thereof.&nbsp; It emphasizes that there is nothing in fact and in law that would support the petitioner's bare claim of ownership and possession over Lots 138-A and 138-C.&nbsp; On the contrary, there is allegedly strong evidence showing respondent municipality's exercise of proprietary and governmental rights over the said lots where it has constructed permanent structures, <span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.,</span> municipal building, community hospital, health center, social hall/basketball court, and where public functions are openly conducted.<br><br>Respondent municipality urges the Court to dismiss the petition and, instead, to affirm the decision of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> declaring it the lawful owner and possessor of Lots 138-A and 138-C.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Issue</span><br></div><br>The substantive issue to be resolved is whether the appellate court correctly declared Lots 138-A and 138-C as property of public dominion, hence, not susceptible to ownership by either the petitioner and respondent municipality.<br><br>Since respondent municipality no longer sought the review of the assailed decision of the appellate court, the Court shall mainly resolve the merits of the petitioner's claim of ownership over Lots 138-A and 138-C vis-à-vis the appellate court's holding that they are of public dominion, hence, not susceptible to private ownership.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The petition is denied.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Laws of the Indies and the cases cited</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">by the petitioner do not support its claim</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">of ownership over Lots 138-A and 138-C</span><br><br>The petitioner anchors its claim of ownership over Lots 138-A and 138-C on its theory that the entire Lot 138, bounded on all its four sides by streets, was assigned to it as far back as 1894 when the church was built in the middle of the said lot.&nbsp; The cases it cited allegedly stand for the proposition that "under the Laws of the Indies, when a municipality was created, the church was assigned a property consisting of a parcel of land bounded on all its (four) sides by streets, and that the public plaza was situated not on the same parcel of land assigned to the church but on a distinct parcel of land separated from the parcel of land assigned to the church by a street."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>This allegation fails to persuade.&nbsp; The pertinent provision of the Laws of the Indies relating to the designation of a parcel of land for the church upon the establishment of a town or pueblo during the Spanish regime reads:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Ley viij.

The Court therein held that "the whole of the land not occupied by the church of the town of Victoria and its parish house, is a public plaza of the said town, of public use." &nbsp; It justified its conclusion, thus:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>From the evidence presented by both parties it appears that the town of Victoria, which was formerly only a barrio of the town of Tarlac and known as Canarum, was converted into a town in 1855, and named Victoria; to this end they must have laid out the streets and the plaza of the town, in the center of which were situated the church and parish house from the commencement, and at the expiration of about twelve years the parish of said town was constituted and the priest, who was to perform the office of curate, was appointed; that from the very beginning, the large tract of land that surrounds the church and the parish house was known as a public plaza, destined to the use of all the residents of the recently founded town; public performances and religious processions were held thereon without hindrance either on the part of the local authorities or of the curate of said town.<br><br>It must be assumed that the principal residents of the old barrio, being interested in the conversion of the barrio into a civil town, arranged in such a way that the barrio, as the center of the future town which was subsequently called Victoria, should have streets and a public plaza with its church and parish house, and also a tribunal or building destined for the use of the municipality and the local official at the time called the <span style="font-style: italic;">gobernadorcillo</span> and later on <span style="font-style: italic;">capitan municipal</span>, as has occurred in the foundation of all the towns in these Islands, under the old administrative laws.<br><br>It may be true that the father of the witness Casimiro Tañedo, who owned the space of land where the church and parish house were erected, had voluntarily donated it to the Catholic Church, the only one known at the time, but proper proof is lacking that the donation affirmed by the said Tañedo comprehended the whole of the large tract which at the present time constitutes the plaza of the town.<br><br>It was a custom observed by all the towns established administratively in these Islands under the old Laws of the Indies, that on their creation, a certain amount of land was always reserved for <span style="font-style: italic;">plazas</span>, commons, and special and communal property, and as it is unquestionable that the said large space of land was left vacant in the center of the town of Victoria when it was constituted as a civil town, more than twelve years prior to the appointment of a permanent curate therein, there are good grounds to suppose that the late Vicente Tañedo donated the land now occupied by the church and parish house in said municipality for religious purposes, or to the church, but not to the parish curate, because at the time there was no curate at the new town of Victoria.<br><br>Even though all the remaining space of land which now forms the great plaza of the town of Victoria had been owned by the said Tañedo, it must be presumed that he waived his right thereto for the benefit of the townspeople, since from the creation or establishment of the town, down to the present day, all the residents, including the curate of said town, have enjoyed the free use of said plaza; it has not been satisfactorily shown that the municipality or the <span style="font-style: italic;">principales</span> of the town of Victoria had donated the whole of said land to the curate of Victoria or to the Catholic Church, as alleged, nor could it have been so donated, it being a public plaza destined to public use and was not private ownership, or patrimony of the town of Victoria, or of the Province of Tarlac.<br><br>It should be noted that, among other things, plazas destined to the public use are not subject to prescription. (Art. 1936, Civil Code.) That both the curates and the <span style="font-style: italic;">gobernadorcillos</span> of the said town procured fruit trees and plants to be set out in the <span style="font-style: italic;">plaza</span>, does not constitute an act of private ownership, but evidences the public use thereof, or perhaps the intention to improve and embellish the said plaza for the benefit of the townspeople.<br><br>Certain it is that the plaintiff has not proven that the Catholic Church or the parish of Victoria was the owner or proprietor of the said extensive piece of land which now forms the public <span style="font-style: italic;">plaza</span> of said town, nor that it was in possession thereof under the form and conditions required by law, inasmuch as it has been fully proven that said <span style="font-style: italic;">plaza</span> has been used without let or hindrance by the public and the residents of the town of Victoria ever since its creation. For the above reasons, it is our opinion that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and that it should be held, as we do hereby hold, that the whole of the land not occupied by the church of the town of Victoria and its parish house, is a public <span style="font-style: italic;">plaza</span> of the said town, of public use, and that in consequence thereof, the defendant is absolved of the complaint without any special ruling as to the costs of both instances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner argues against the applicability of Harty as it makes much of the fact that the disputed lot therein was situated across the street from the church lot.&nbsp; When the Court therein limited the ownership of the church to the land "<span style="font-style: italic;">occupied by the church of the town of Victoria and its parish house,</span>" it did not allegedly confine its ownership to a portion of the lot on which the church and parish house were situated but to the block occupied by these structures.<br><br>To the Court's mind, however, whether the disputed lot was on the same block as the church or separated therefrom by a street was not the crucial factor which constrained the Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Harty</span> to rule against the church's claim of ownership over the said property.&nbsp; Rather, it was the fact that the church was not able to prove its ownership or possession thereof.&nbsp; The ruling on this point is reiterated below:<br><blockquote>Certain it is that the plaintiff has not proven that the Catholic Church or the parish of Victoria was the owner or proprietor of the said extensive piece of land which now forms the public plaza of said town, nor that it was in possession thereof under the form and conditions required by law, x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>As applied to the present case, that Lots 138-A and 138-C are on the same block as the lot on which the church and its parish house stand do not necessarily make them (Lots 138-A and 138-C) also the property of the petitioner absent any evidence that its ownership or possession extended to these lots and under the conditions required by law.<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Contrary to its submission, the petitioner had</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">not acquired ipso jure or by operation of law</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">a government grant or title to the entire Lot 138</span><br><br>The petitioner submits that even granting arguendo that the entire Lot 138 was not assigned to it during the Spanish regime or it is not the owner thereof pursuant to the Laws of the Indies, its open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of Lot 138 since 1894 and for many decades thereafter vests <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso jure </span>or by operation of law upon the petitioner a government grant, a vested title, to the subject property.&nbsp; It cites Subsection 6 of Section 54 of Act No. 926<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and Subsection b of Section 45 of Act No. 2874.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>This contention is likewise not persuasive.<br><br>One of the important requisites for the application of the pertinent provisions of Act No. 926 and Act No. 2874 is the "open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation" of the land by the applicant.&nbsp; Actual possession of land consists in the manifestation of acts of dominion over it of such a nature as a party would naturally exercise over his own property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase "possession and occupation" was explained as follows:"<br><blockquote>It must be underscored that the law speaks of "possession and occupation."&nbsp; Since these words are separated by the conjunction <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>, the clear intention of the law is not to make one synonymous with the order [sic].&nbsp; Possession is broader than occupation because it includes constructive possession.&nbsp; When, therefore, the law adds the word <span style="font-style: italic;">occupation</span>, it seeks to delimit the all-encompassing effect of constructive possession.&nbsp; Taken together with the words <span style="font-style: italic;">open, continuous, exclusive and notorious,</span> the word <span style="font-style: italic;">occupation</span> serves to highlight the fact that for one to qualify under paragraph (b) of the aforesaid section, his possession of the land must not be mere fiction. As this Court stated, through then Mr. Justice Jose P. Laurel, in L<span style="font-style: italic;">asam v. The Director of Lands</span>:<br></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>x x x Counsel for the applicant invokes the doctrine laid down by us in Ramos v.

While, therefore, "possession in the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to have his feet on every square meter of ground before it can be said that he is in possession," possession under paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926, as amended by paragraph (b) of section 45 of Act No. 2874, is not gained by mere nominal claim.&nbsp; The mere planting of a sign or symbol of possession cannot justify a Magellan-like claim of dominion over an immense tract of territory.&nbsp; Possession as a means of acquiring ownership, while it may be constructive, is not a mere fiction. x x x</blockquote></blockquote><center>x x x</center><blockquote>Possession is open when it is patent, visible, apparent, notorious and not clandestine.&nbsp; It is continuous when uninterrupted, unbroken and not intermittent or occasional; exclusive when the adverse possessor can show exclusive dominion over the land and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit; and notorious when it is so conspicuous that it is generally known and talked of by the public or the people in the neighborhood.Use of land is adverse when it is open and notorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></blockquote>Indisputably, the petitioner has been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of Lot 138-B since 1894 as evidenced by the church structure built thereon. However, the record is bereft of any evidence that would tend to show that such possession and occupation extended to Lots 138-A and 138-C beginning the same period.&nbsp; No single instance of the exercise by the petitioner of proprietary acts or acts of dominion over these lots was established.&nbsp; Its unsubstantiated claim that the construction of the municipal building as well as the subsequent improvements thereon, <i>e.g.</i>, the rural health center, Buruanga community Medicare hospital, basketball court, Rizal monument and grandstand, was by its tolerance does not constitute proof of possession and occupation on its (the petitioner's) part. <br><br>Absent the important requisite of open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation thereon since 1894, no government grant or title to Lots 138-A and 138-C had vested upon the petitioner <i>ipso jure</i> or by operation of law.&nbsp; Possession under paragraph 6 of section 54 of Act No. 926, as amended by paragraph (b) of section 45 of Act No. 2874, is not gained by mere nominal claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]<br><br></sup><i>Lots 138-A and 138-C comprise the <br>public </i><i>plaza and are property of public dominion; <br></i><i>hence, not susceptible to private ownership </i><i><br>by the petitioner or respondent municipality <br><br></i>The appellate court correctly declared that Lots 138-A and 138-C comprise the public plaza and are property of public dominion; hence, may not be the object of appropriation either by the petitioner or respondent municipality.&nbsp; In support thereof, it cited <i>Bishop of Calbayog</i> ratiocinating:<blockquote>This ruling [referring to <i>Harty</i>] was, in fact, reiterated in <i>Bishop of Calbayog v. Director of Lands</i> (45 SCRA 418) involving the same question of ownership of the land which surrounded the parish church of the town.&nbsp; The Supreme Court therein declared that the public plaza and public thoroughfare are not subject to registration by the church; that since neither the Church nor the municipality presented positive proof of ownership or exclusive possession for an appreciable period of time, and the only indubitable fact is the free and continuous use of Lot 2 by residents of Catarman, and the town had no public plaza to speak of other than the disputed parcel of land, there was a strong presumption that the same had been segregated as a public plaza upon the founding of the municipality of Catarman. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote>As can be gleaned, the above discussion principally pertained to Lot 2, a public plaza the ownership of which was disputed by the Bishop of Calbayog and the Municipality of Catarman.<br><br>The appellate court correctly cited <i>Bishop of Calabayog</i>. However, the ruling therein pertaining to a portion of Lot 1 occupied by a public thoroughfare is more apropos to the present case.&nbsp; To recall, in the said case, the application of the Bishop of Calabayog as to the eastern portion of Lot 1 was also being opposed by the Municipality of Catarman on the ground that it was part of the public plaza.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the Court upheld the ownership of the church over Lot 1 including not only the space occupied by the church, belfry, convent, parish school and nuns' residence, but also the empty space which only had some benches as improvements thereon. Significantly, the portion of Lot 1 occupied by a public thoroughfare (Nalazon Street) was ordered excluded from the application for registration filed by the church. The Court therein made the following findings with respect to the public thoroughfare:<blockquote>Admittedly Nalazon St. was originally merely a trail used by the parishioners in going to and from the church. But since 1910, when it was opened and improved as a public thoroughfare by the municipality, it had been continuously used as such by the townspeople of Catarman without objection from the Church authorities. The acacia trees along both sides of the street were planted by the municipality in 1920, although these trees <br> were cut down recently upon order of the priest. There is no proof that the Church merely tolerated and limited the use of this street for the benefit of its parishioners, considering that the street traverses the entire length of the <i>poblacion</i> from south to north and that Lot 1, on which the church stands, is located almost at the center of the <i>poblacion</i>. The street does not stop on Lot 1 but extends north toward the sea, passing along the lot occupied by the Central Elementary School and the Northern Samar General Hospital. Thus, it is clear that Nalazon St. inside Lot 1 is used by the residents not only in going to the church but to the public school and the general hospital north of Lot 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote>In the present case, the following improvements now stand on Lots 138-A and 138-C: the municipal building, rural health center, Buruanga community Medicare hospital, basketball court, Rizal monument and grandstand. Except for the construction of the municipal building, the other improvements were made on Lots 138-A and 138-C, and continuously used by the public without the petitioner's objection.&nbsp; Further, there is no proof that the petitioner merely tolerated the construction of these improvements.&nbsp; On the other hand, the free and continuous use by the public of Lots 138-A and 138-C, as found by the court <i>a quo</i> and affirmed by the appellate court, incontrovertibly establishes that they are property for public use.On this point, Articles 420, quoted anew below, and 424 of the Civil Code are applicable:<blockquote>Art. 420.&nbsp; The following things are property of public dominion:<p></p><blockquote>(1) Those intended for public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports and bridges constructed by the State, banks, shores, roadsteads, and others of similar character;<p></p><center>...</center>Art. 424. Property for public use, in the provinces, cities, and municipalities, consist of the provincial roads, city streets, municipal streets, the squares, fountains, public waters, promenades, and public works for public service paid for by said provinces, cities or municipalities. </blockquote></blockquote>Property for public use of provinces and towns are governed by the same principles as property of public dominion of the same character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>&nbsp; The ownership of such property, which has the special characteristics of a collective ownership for the general use and enjoyment, by virtue of their application to the satisfaction of the collective needs, is in the social group, whether national, provincial, or municipal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup>&nbsp; Their purpose is not to serve the State as a juridical person, but the citizens; they are intended for the common and public welfare, and so they cannot be the object of appropriation, either by the State or by private persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><i><br><br>The appellate court committed no reversible<br>error in denying the petitioner's motion for<br>reception of evidence</i><br><br>In denying the petitioner's motion for reception evidence, the appellate court reasoned that based on the records, the petitioner was already accorded the full opportunity to present its evidence in the court <i>a quo</i> and that the evidence to be introduced in the desired hearing would not directly establish its ownership of the disputed lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The petitioner's motion for reception of evidence filed with the appellate court stated that the additional evidence that it sought to submit consisted of affidavits of old residents of Buruanga attesting to the fact that "the old municipal building was in fact at a place called Sunset Park prior to its transfer to the present site."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; These affidavits would allegedly establish that respondent municipality could not be the owner of Lots 138-A and 138-C which it had neither possessed nor occupied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The appellate court did not err in denying the petitioner's motion for reception of evidence.&nbsp; Indeed, the petitioner was already given full opportunity during the trial in the court<i> a quo</i> to adduce any and all relevant evidence to substantiate its claim of ownership over the entire Lot 138.&nbsp; In no sense, therefore, may it be argued that it was denied due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; <br> With the reality that those documents were never presented and formally offered during the trial in the court <i>a quo</i>, their belated admission for purposes of having them duly considered in the resolution of the case on appeal would certainly collide with Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court which reads:<blockquote>SECTION 34. <i>Offer of Evidence</i>. — The court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.&nbsp; The purpose for which the evidence is offered must be specified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></blockquote>In any case, as correctly stated by the appellate court, these affidavits would not directly establish the petitioner's ownership over Lots 138-A and 138-C.<p></p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.&nbsp; The Decision dated January 31, 2001 of the Court of Appeals and its Resolution dated July 18, 2001 in CA-G.R.
