				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Two parcels of land situated at Barrio Pineda, Pasig City, Lots 13-A and 13-B, each containing an area of 225 square meters, were registered in the Registry of Deeds for the Province of Rizal in the name of Petronilo Sta.

Ana (Teodoro) who was then abroad, executed a Deed of Sale covering Lot 13-A in favor of herein respondents Lourdes Panlasigue (Lourdes) and Julieta P. Santiago (Julieta).  On even date, Anatolia, together with the same eight children and Teodoro's wife Fe, donated Lot 13-B to Ireneo Sta. Ana (Ireneo), one of the Sta. Ana children, via a "Deed of Extrajudicial Partition and Donation"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> stating, <span style="font-style: italic;">inter alia,</span> as follows, quoted <span style="font-style: italic;">verbatim</span>:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>That they are the only legitimate surviving spouses and children who survive the deceased Petronilo Sta.

He thus prayed for the court to order:<br><ol><li>defendants Panlasigue and Santiago <u>to</u> <u>reconvey</u> <u>unto</u> <u>the</u> <u>plaintiff</u> <u>his</u> <u>one-eighteenth</u> <u>(1/18)</u> <u>share</u> <u>in</u> <u>Lot</u> 1<u>3-A;</u><br><br></li><li>defendants Ireneo Sta. and Jasmin Jarmin <u>to</u> <u>reconvey</u> <u>unto</u> <u>the</u> <u>plaintiff</u> <u>his</u> <u>one-eighteenth</u> <u>(1/18)</u> <u>share</u> <u>in</u> <u>Lot</u> <u>13-B;</u><br><br></li><li>defendants Ireneo Sta.

Hence, they prayed for judgment ordering<br><blockquote><ol><li>defendants Panlasigue and Santiago <u>to</u> <u>convey</u> <u>unto</u> <u>plaintiffs-intervenors</u> <u>their</u><u>rightful</u> <u>share</u> in the property now covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 66276 of the Register of Deeds in Pasig City, and</li> <br><li>defendants Sps.

IN NOT ORDERING THE PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE TO PAY THE DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, Lourdes and Julieta ascribed to the trial court the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>. . .

It thus held that the two lots were co-owned by Anatolia and her children.  <br><br>Applying Article 493 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote><u>Each</u> <u>co-owner</u> <u>shall</u> <u>have</u> <u>the</u> <u>full</u> <u>ownership</u> of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved.  But <u>the</u> <u>effect</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>alienation</u> <u>or</u> <u>the</u> <u>mortgage</u>, <u>with</u> <u>respect</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>co-owners</u>, <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>limited</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>portion</u> <u>which</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>allotted</u> <u>to</u> <u>him</u> in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership. (Underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>the appellate court held that the trial court erred in nullifying the assailed documents as in fact it noted that Teodoro and the intervenors-children of Nicolas merely prayed for reconveyance of their respective shares of the lots, and not for the declaration of nullity of said documents. <br><br>The appellate court thus concluded:<br><blockquote>The [two lots] belonged to the heirs in the following proportion:   <u>one-half</u> <u>(1/2)</u> <u>share</u> <u>to</u> <u>Anatolia</u> <u>as</u> <u>her</u> <u>share</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>conjugal</u> <u>partnership;</u> whereas all nine (9) [<i>sic</i>] children plus Anatolia shared in the other one-half (1/2) belonging to Petronilo in shares of 1/10 each (Art. 996, Civil Code).  Otherwise stated, <u>all</u> <u>the</u> <u>heirs</u> <u>were</u> <u>entitled</u> <u>to</u> <u>one-twentieth</u> <u>(1/20)</u> <u>share</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>property</u> <u>except</u> <u>Anatolia</u> <u>who</u> <u>was</u> <u>entitled</u> <u>to</u> <u>eleven-twentieth</u> <u>(11/20)</u> share thereof.  With regard to the intervenors, the 1/20 share of their deceased father shall be divided between them since they succeed by right of representation (Art. 974, Civil Code).  And having affixed their signatures thereto, all the heirs are conclusively presumed to have admitted the regularity and validity of the deeds of sale and donation insofar as their respective portions were concerned.  Needless to state, <u>both</u> <u>the</u> <u>deed</u> <u>of</u> <u>sale</u> <u>and</u> <u>deed</u> <u>of</u> <u>partition</u> <u>with</u> <u>donation</u> <u>are</u> <u>valid</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Respecting the complaint of the intervenors, the appellate court held that they, as heirs of their father Nicolas, were not bound by the deeds, they not having participated therein, hence, they were entitled to their father's "1/20 [sic] share."<br><br>Respecting Teodoro's claim that he had no knowledge of the execution on his behalf by his wife of the two documents, the appellate court discredited the same, it noting that there was evidence that he had knowledge of the illness and treatment of his then sick mother, the expenses for which were shouldered by his brother Ireneo and his wife to thus necessitate the execution of the challenged documents. <br><br>In another vein, the appellate court found plaintiff to be guilty of laches.<br><br>Thus, applying Art. 1101 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 1101.  The heir who is sued shall have the option of indemnifying the plaintiff for the loss, or consenting to a new partition.<br><br>Indemnity may be made by payment in cash or by the delivery of a thing of the same kind and quality as that awarded to the plaintiff.<br><br>x x x x ,<br></blockquote>the appellate court disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  In lieu thereof, judgment is rendered <u>ordering</u> <u><b>defendants</b></u> <u>to</u> <u>reconvey</u> <u>to</u> <u>intervenors-appellees</u> <u>their</u> <u>1/20</u> <u><b>share</b></u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>property</u> <u>or</u> <u>its</u> <u>equivalent</u> <u>in</u> <u>money.</u>  The case filed by plaintiff-appellee Teodoro Sta. Ana is <b>DISMISSED</b>. With costs against the plaintiff-appellee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Hence, the present petition for review on certiorari filed by Teodoro (hereafter petitioner), raising the following arguments:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The extra-judicial partition is null and void.<br><br></li><li>The deed of sale between Anatolia Sta. Ana and Respondents Panlasigue and Santiago is null and void.<br><br></li><li>The right of Petitioner to question the title of Respondents Panlasigue and Santiago over the subject property has neither prescribed nor been barred by laches.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The first and second arguments of petitioner fail.  The  finding of the appellate court that the challenged deeds are not null and void is in accordance with law and evidence, as reflected in the discussion above.  Indeed, that the living children of Petronilo  joined Anatolia in the execution of the documents clearly shows that they were co-owners of the lots.  As such, they were at liberty to alienate their respective shares of the lots.<br><br>Respecting the last argument on laches, petitioner maintains that he had "no knowledge of the execution on his behalf by his wife" of the challenged documents, he being then out of the country. <br><br>At the witness stand, however, petitioner declared on direct examination as follows:<br><br><table align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="12%">Q.</td><td width="88%"> Mr. Sta. Ana, when you learned that lot 13-A was sold to defendant Lourdes Panlasique and Julieta Santiago, what did you do?<br><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td> I was abroad at that time and when I arrived what I saw was the house was being constructed already.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><br>And on cross examination, he admitted that his wife signed for him in the documents but that she was forced to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In any event, petitioner contends that even assuming arguendo that he is guilty of laches, the case had not prescribed, he citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Mariategui v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which held:<br><blockquote>x x x Corollarily, prescription does not run against private respondents with respect to the filing of the action for partition so long as the heirs for whose benefit prescription is invoked, have not expressly  or  impliedly  repudiated the co-ownership.  <b><u>In</u> <u>other</u> <u>words</u>, <u>prescription</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>action</u> <u>for</u> <u>partition</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>lie</u> <u>except</u> <u>when</u> <u>the</u> <u>co-ownership</u> <u>is</u> <u>properly</u> <u>repudiated</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>co-owner</u>.</b><br><br>Otherwise stated, a co-owner cannot acquire by prescription the share of the other co-owners absent a clear repudiation of co-ownership duly communicated to the other co-owners.  Furthermore, an action to demand partition is imprescriptible and cannot be barred by laches. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring by petitioner)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's citation of Mariategui is misplaced.  His complaint is not one for partition, but for reconveyance.<br><br>Jurisprudence of course dictates that the "[t]he doctrine of laches should never be applied earlier than the expiration of time limited for the commencement of actions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> unless, as a general rule, inexcusable delay in asserting a right and acquiescence in existing conditions are proven."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>From the annotation on May 6, 1988 of the challenged documents on Petronilo's title up to the filing by petitioner on August 20, 1996 of the complaint subject of the present case, a period of more than 8 years had elapsed.  Gratuitously assuming that  the  action  for  reconveyance  is  based   on  implied  trust,  it prescribes in 10 years. Therefore, petitioner's complaint had not prescribed  when  he  filed  his  complaint.  The  facts  and circumstances   attendant   to  the  case  reflected  above   indicate, however, that there was inexcusable delay on the part of Teodoro in asserting his right and acquiescence in existing conditions. <br><br>The same situation does not hold true with respect to Nicolas' heirs-complainants-in-intervention.  Hence, laches cannot be attributed to them and, therefore, they are entitled to a reconveyance of their father's share.<br><br>The share of the father of complainants-in-intervention <u>in</u> <u>each</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>two</u> <u>lots</u> should be 1/11 of ½ representing the share of each of the 10 siblings who were co-owners of said ½, along with their mother Anatolia.  A modification of the sharing indicated in the decision of the appellate court is thus in order. <br><br>A further modification of the decision would also have been called for.  For respondents-vendees had already paid for Lot 13-A, hence, no obligation for them to reconvey anything to the complainants-in-intervention arises.  They, however, did not appeal the appellate court's decision ordering all the defendants, including them - respondents-vendees, "to reconvey to intervenors-appellees" their share of the lot sold or its equivalent.  Hence, they are bound by said decision which constitutes the law of the case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is, in light of the foregoing discussions, <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> in that respondent-spouses Ireneo Sta. Ana are <b>ORDERED</b> to contribute to the 1/11 share to be reconveyed to complainants-in-intervention in each of the two lots subject of the case representing the share of Nicolas Sta. Ana. <br><br>Costs against petitioner. <br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Quisumbing, (Chairperson), Carpio, Tinga </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco, Jr., JJ., </span>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit "C" to the Complaint, records, pp. 10-12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at  1-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 35-38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Motion for Leave to Intervene, id. at 64-65.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Id. at 66- 69.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 68.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Id. at 79-82.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Id. at 80<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Id. at 176-180.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Id. at 179-180<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo </span>at 43.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Id. at  42.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Id. at 43.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Id. at 46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Id. at 49; Penned by Justice Portia Aliño-Hormachuelos with the concurrence of Justices Eriberto U.
