				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a case of rape.Appellant Aquilio Acabo was found "guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having committed the crime of rape as defined in Article 335 (1) of the Revised Penal Code x x x upon the person of Jeany Polinar,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the private complainant, and sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of reclusion perpetua. Appellant was also "ordered to pay unto the offended party the sum of P30,000.00 as damages",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and costs. Appellant is now before us asking for the reversal of his conviction based on the following correlated errors allegedly committed by the trial court, to wit:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT ACCUSED HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH JENNY POLINAR ON FEBRUARY 25, 1990;<br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT SAID SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WAS AGAINST THE WILL OF JENNY POLINAR;<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED."</blockquote>Hereunder is the recital of facts as summarized by the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in its decision and duly supported by the evidence on record:<br><blockquote>"The victim Jeany Polinar is a 20 years old maiden whose story is as follows: She is a layworker of the Parish of Olutanga. At about 11:00 o'clock in the morning of February 25, 1990, which was a Sunday, after accomplishing her work at the church, she started to go home to barangay Cawilan, of the municipality of Talusan. She had to pass by the house of her elder married sister Rosie Acabo at barangay Fama, municipality of Olutanga. Dropping in at the house of her sister, she had met the accused Aquilio Acabo, the husband of her sister, alone in the house. She had asked her brother-in-law where her manang Rosie was, and answered by Aquilio Acabo that her Manang Rosie was at the tank washing the clothes. She then proceeded to empty the contents of the bag she was carrying and transferring the same to another bag. While in the process of bending and emptying her bag, the accused held her at the nape and tried to drag her into a room. When she attempted to shout, the accused covered her mouth with the other hand. She tried to struggled to free herself, but the accused boxed her at the epigastric region of her bread-basket below the sternum. She had stopped struggling and when the accused had loosen his hold upon her, she stood up and darted to the window and tried to jump down. But the accused was able to take hold of her upper arm and hair, and pulled her back into the room. Then the accused boxed both her left and right thighs, and begun removing the square pants and panties that victim was wearing. The accused had pinned down Jeany Polinar with his body, while removing his short pants. After having removed his pants, the accused was able to consummate the sexual assault lying on top of the victim. She did not know how long the accused had lain on top of her performing the sexual act because she was in pain caused by the sexual assault. After a while the accused stood up and went out then returned with a scythe, admonishing the victim from telling anybody about the incident and threatening her with death if she would tell anybody. Jeany had pleaded and convinced the accused that she will not tell anybody, and was able to get out of the house. She proceeded to go home but on the way she met her mother and sister Rosie, and immediately reported the matter to her mother and sister Rosie, the wife of the accused. Her mother had proceeded to the house of the accused and confronted him. The accused merely remained silent. The following day, February 26, 1990, accompanied by her mother and uncle, they went to the hospital at Suba-Nipa (Poblacion of Olutanga) and submitted herself to medical examination. Subsequently she filed the complaint for Rape against accused Aquilio Acabo.<br><br>"The victim Jeany Polinar was medically examined the following day, February 26, 1990, at 11:00 o'clock A.M., or 23 hours after the incident. She had slight laceration on the opening of the vagina, which was still bleeding, and that she had no more hymen. So, the laceration was on the opening of the vagina just below the vulva, and in the opinion of Dr. Franklin Macalua, she was no longer a virgin at the time of the supposed rape. He could not say as to the presence of sperms in the vagina of the victim as the Medical Technologist was absent at the time of the examination and no laboratory test was taken to determine its presence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>[Note: "Sic" was not inserted in order not to clutter the narration.]</blockquote>In his first assignment of error, appellant faults the trial court for ignoring the alleged existence of an illicit relationship between him and the complainant which the appellant emphasizes was corroborated by the testimony of the complainant's sister and appellant's wife, Rosie Acabo. Appellant insists that no sexual contact occurred on February 25, 1990, for complainant was then having her menstruation supposedly evidenced by complainant's three bloodstained panties. Due to complainant's menstruation, appellant claims that he merely contented himself in kissing, hugging and inserting his forefinger inside complainants' private organ which purportedly caused the laceration at its opening. The other injuries sustained by the complainant, appellant explains, were caused not by the application of force, violence or intimidation upon her person, but by the complainant's jumping out of the window and, subsequently, by appellant's pulling her back inside the room on which occasion her body abraded against the windowsill.<br><br>We are not persuaded. The existence of an illicit relationship between the appellant and the complainant lacks factual basis as it is founded on appellant's bare and self serving testimony unsupported by any letter, notes or other tokens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The corroborative testimony of Rosie Acabo is not reliable since she has no personal knowledge of the existence of the unholy relationship. Her motive in testifying is suspect. Indeed, records disclose that just after complainant divulged to her parents and to her sister Rosie the ordeal she suffered from the hands of the appellant, it was Rosie herself who confronted the appellant about the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In addition, Rosie helped the complainant in reporting the incident to the police authorities and accompanied her to the doctor's clinic for medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> It appears, then, that appellant's defense is more of a concoction than real. At any rate, the existence of an illicit relationship, which was shown to be otherwise, does not preclude the commission of rape nor exonerate the appellant from the charge. What is important is that the elements necessary for the commission of the crime have been duly proved which in this case were persuasively established beyond a shadow of doubt.<br><br>Similarly, appellantâ€™s claim that complainant was having her menstruation on the day of the incident is devoid of merit for lack of clear and positive evidence. The presence of three blood stained panties, the ownership of which was not even positively established, does not sufficiently prove complainant's menstruation at the time. The undisputed fact is that the medical doctor who conducted the physical and internal examinations of the complainant testified that the bleeding of complainant's private organ was not due to menstruation, but due to her vaginal laceration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Moreover, the presence or absence of menstruation does not negate the crime of rape nor render its execution impossible. Lust is no respecter of the victim's condition.<br><br>Appellant's explanation that complainant's injuries were the result of his pulling her up from the ground to the room via the window is also unmeritorious. Records disclose that complainant suffered the following:<br><blockquote>"FINDINGS:<br><br>EDEMA, ERYTHEMA OF RIGHT NECK, BRUISES, RIGHT AND LEFT UPPER EXTREMETIES HEMATOMA, RIGHT AND LEFT THIGHS<br><br>INTERNAL EXAMINATION:<br><br>Presence of vaginal lacerations - with bleeding<br>Admits one finger<br>Vaginal swab - for laboratory examination for spermatozoa"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>injuries which consistently support complainant's testimony that appellant held her at the rape of her neck and boxed her during the incident: first, on her upper abdomen and second, on her left and right thighs that caused her to stumble.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Appellant's denial cannot prevail over complainant's direct, positive and categorical assertion which, we note, rings with truth. Denial, as a settled rule, is inherently a weak defense which can not outweigh complainant's positive testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, appellant's insistence in his reply brief[12] that his testimony was never rebutted is not worthy of attention since rebuttal is not even needed. Courts give more credence to the testimony of witnesses for the prosecution which is positive in nature than the negative evidence of the appellant and his witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In his second assigned error, appellant postulates that even assuming that sexual intercourse occurred on February 25, 1990, it, however, was with complainant's consent as "the offended party 'voluntarily entered the sex drama with gusto without being forced to do so, x x x."'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> To bolster this contention, appellant claims that complainant's behavior at the height of the sexual assault on her person did not conform to the normal course of conduct as she failed to cry or shout for help. Appellant maintains that the complainant "must have entertained the belief that the niece of the [appellant] saw them inside the house in a scandalous circumstance and having this in mind she must have entertained the idea that Jocelyn Arellano, [the appellant's niece] will report the matter to her sister and mother."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, the filing of the complaint to pre-empt the revelation of their secret and to save herself from humiliation.<br><br>Appellantâ€™s insistence that the complainant consented to the sexual assault deserves scant consideration. Complainant's failure to shout did not make voluntary complainant's submission to the criminal acts of the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Besides, appellant covered her mouth most of the time and due to his incessant harassment she was overwhelmed by fear. More importantly, we note that complainant immediately reported the detestable crime moments after its occurrence to her parents and sister without hesitation and feeling of embarrassment. The following day, she had herself medically examined. Two days later, she filed a complaint before the court. This conduct distinctly shows complainant's unwillingness and deep resentment over her ordeal and eloquently disproves appellant's claim that the charge was merely fabricated to save the complainant from humiliation. A victim of rape will not come out in the open if her motive was not to obtain justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Apropos is the trial court's incisive observation which we quote with approval:<br><blockquote>"The accused tried to synchronize his testimony with that of the offended party by admitting that Jeany Polinar did try to jump out of the open window, but was able to pull her back into the bedroom justifying the action of Jeany Polinar as an attempt to escape from his carnal lust, but for fear of being discovered and reported to her elder sister, "Nang Rosie." Considering that the window sill was just about six feet from the ground, why did the accused not just let her go, instead of pulling her back into the room? Was he not afraid or apprehensive that the matter may be reported to his wife Rosie? The lustful intent of the accused in trying to consummate the sexual act upon Jeany Polinar is clearly shown by his testimony as follows:<br><blockquote><b>"COURT:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; (Clarifying questions)<br><table Â ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">Q-</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="LEFT">You testified a while ago that she did not want to have sexual intercourse with you because she was menstruating and you tried to insert your forefinger and you really found out that she was menstruating, is that correct?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A-</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q-</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">The question of the Court is, at that moment when you were inserting your forefinger, did you still have your pants on?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A-</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q-</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">So, after noticing that she was menstruating why did you still try to stand up and remove your pants?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A-</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Because I really wanted to have sexual intercourse during that time.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q- </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Even if she was menstruating, you still wanted to have sexual intercourse with her?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A-</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">I was only stopped when I was kicked by her."

Unfortunately the accused had regained balance and had dragged the complainant into the room. At this instant, there is very little for the imagination to conjecture what will happen next, unless prevented by forces or events not within the control of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>[Note: "Sic" was not inserted in order not to clutter the account]<br><br>Furthermore, the testimonies of the complainant's mother, quoted below, and sister, a defense witness at that, corroborate her account that she was sexually abused.
