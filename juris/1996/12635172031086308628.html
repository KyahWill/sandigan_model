				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At least two primordial issues are posed by the herein petition for review on certiorari: (1) Whether a money judgment rendered by a Court in a case for Mandamus and Prohibition is valid or not, the defendant, a Municipal Mayor, (a) having died during trial and before judgment could be rendered, and (b) after the defendant mayor and all the other respondents ceased to hold office, without the substitution of parties provided for in Section 18, Rule 3, of the Rules of Court; and (2) Whether the said money judgment against the said deceased defendant mayor, assuming that the case has survived against him, can be enforced in the very same case or in the proper estate proceedings.<br><br>This petition for review on certiorari seeks a reversal of: (1) the Court of Appeals’ decision, dated December 23, 1994, which dismissed the petitioners’ certiorari petition on mere technicalities and (2) the Court of Appeals’ resolution, dated February 17, 1995, which denied the petitioners’ motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<br><br>Specifically, the petitioners pray, among others, for the nullification of the writ of execution and the execution sale of the "pro-indiviso" share and interest of the deceased mayor, Dr. Nemencio G. Galvez, in the land covered by TCT No. T-307783 to satisfy the money judgment contained in the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 9, Malolos, Bulacan, dated May 6, 1988, which awarded moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees, in favor of the then petitioner, now one of the private respondents, Amparo San Gabriel-Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The antecedent facts as culled from the records of this case and as gathered by the lower court from the <u>ex</u>-<u>parte</u> proceedings appear to be that:<br><br>The late Dr. Nemencio G.

Still, no favorable action came from the said Mayor Galvez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On January 29, 1985, a petition was filed with the Philippine Gamefowl Commission (PGC) by private respondent Mendoza against Mayor Galvez praying, among others, for the issuance of an interlocutory order so that the cockpit may operate temporarily while awaiting the approval of its renewal papers. The then PGC Acting Chairman Luis A. Tabuena wired Mayor Galvez, the Bulacan Provincial PC Commander, and the PC-INP Station Commander of Balagtas, Bulacan, stating that the cockpit was allowed temporary operation pending hearing of the aforestated petition inasmuch as the refusal to issue a business permit was without any valid ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On February 23,1985, Mayor Nemencio Galvez filed a Motion to Dismiss the petition with the Philippine Gamefowl Commission for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On April 18, 1985, the Philippine Gamefowl Commission issued an Order allowing the temporary operation of the Balagtas Sports Arena "until further orders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On April 19, 1985, the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas passed and unanimously approved a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which ordered the closure and cessation of operations of private respondent Mendoza’s cockpit until payment of the proper municipal taxes from 1980 to 1984 shall have been effected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On May 15, 1995, the above Resolution No. 08-85, after submission to and consideration by the Governor and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Bulacan, was approved by virtue of Resolution No. 256<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of the Bulacan Provincial Board.<br><br>On August 19, 1985, Mayor Nemencio Galvez wrote private respondent Mendoza informing her of the impending closure of her cockpit as per Resolution No. 08-85 of the Balagtas Sangguniang Bayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 22, 1995, Mayor Nemencio Galvez ordered that the cockpit’s gate be padlocked to effect cessation of its operations, pursuant to Resolution No. 08-85 of the Municipal Council of Balagtas, Bulacan and Resolution No. 256 of the Provincial Board of Bulacan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the scheduled special "pintakasi"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> on August 22, 23 and 24, 1985, at the Balagtas Sports Arena to raise funds for the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, which was reset for August 29, 30 and 31, did not materialize on account of the mayor’s closure order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On August 27, 1985, upon recourse to the Philippine Gamefowl Commission by private respondent Mendoza, separate telegrams were sent anew to Mayor Galvez and the same Provincial Commander and the same Police Station Commander to whom the Interlocutory Order, dated April 18, 1985, was addressed, reminding them to respect the said Order allowing temporary operations of the Balagtas Sports Arena (cockpit).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On September 3, 1985, private respondent Mendoza filed a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> for Mandamus and Prohibition, with Damages and Prayer for a Preliminary Mandatory and Prohibitory Injunctions, against Mayor Nemencio Galvez and the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan. Principally, the petition sought to compel the respondent officials to issue a municipal license and permit in favor of the Balagtas Sports Arena and to enjoin them from enforcing or implementing their Resolution No. 08-85 until further orders from the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On September 4, 1985, a Temporary Restraining Order was issued by the Regional Trial Court of Bulacan, Branch 9.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Hence, business operations of the Balagtas Sports Arena were resumed.<br><br>On September 11, 1985, a Motion to Quash Restraining Order was filed by the public officials in the petition for mandamus and prohibition, with damages. Private respondent Mendoza, then petitioner, opposed the said motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On September 26, 1985, the lower court ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction with the same tenor as the TRO earlier issued. The lower court further ordered: (1) the Revenue Collection Agent of Balagtas, Bulacan, to submit a statement or schedule of the local taxes allegedly due from private respondent Mendoza; (2) the Municipal Treasurer of Balagtas, Bulacan, to submit his reply to the letter of cockpit manager, ex-Mayor Gonzales, requesting for a copy of the pertinent municipal tax ordinance relating to the cockpit’s unpaid taxes; and (3) the Balagtas public-officials involved to submit a certified true copy of the case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> cited in their Motion to Quash Restraining Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On October 7, 1985, a motion praying that the public officials in Civil Case No. 8385-M be declared in default was filed by private respondent Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On October 10, 1985, the said public officials duly represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, through the Provincial Fiscal’s (now Prosecutor’s) Office of Bulacan, filed a Motion to Admit Answer which was opposed by private respondent Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Said Answer prayed for a dismissal of the petition alleging: (1) that the mayor, under the Local Government Code (BP Blg. 337) has the discretionary power to grant or revoke permits relating to the operation of cockpit arenas; (2) that the municipal council has the inherent power to pass resolutions or ordinances prohibiting or ordering the closure of cockpit arenas; and (3) that the local public officials have the inherent power to effect collection of taxes due the local government as provided under the Local Tax Code (PD 321, as amended).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On December 5, 1985, the lower court issued a default order against Mayor Nemencio Galvez and the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan, thereby allowing the reception of evidence <u>ex</u>-<u>parte</u> from private respondent Mendoza on December 11, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On January 9, 1986, Mayor Galvez and the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan filed a motion for reconsideration and/or to set aside order of default and/or judgment which was again opposed by private respondent Mendoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On March 18, 1986, the lower court denied the above motion.&nbsp; Hence, the case was deemed submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>At this point in time, the EDSA Revolution had taken place which consequently resulted in the replacement "en masse" of the incumbent local public officials by officers-in-charge (OIC’s) sometime in May 1986. Mayor Galvez and the entire Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan, were not spared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Even the Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 9, Malolos, Bulacan, to whom the Petition for Mandamus and Prohibition, with Damages, was raffled, was replaced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On May 6, 1988, the lower court decided Civil Case No. 8385-M in favor of private respondent Mendoza.

Valid service thereof, he said, should be made upon a Government lawyer or office empowered to represent a Government entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On November 11, 1988, Atty. Galvez, again, by way of special appearance, filed a Motion for Recall of Decision reiterating his position that he could not be compelled to receive the lower court’s decision and praying that the said decision be withdrawn and Civil Case No. 8385-M be dismissed for failure to effect substitution of parties in accordance with Rule 3, Section 18 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On April 6, 1989, the lower court denied Atty. Galvez’ motion for recall of decision on the ground that the decision was already final and executory considering that no appeal nor any motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period was filed by any of the public officials concerned after service was made pursuant to the lower court’s Order, dated May 30, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 1989, a motion for execution was filed by private respondent Mendoza. This motion was granted by the lower court in its Order, dated November 12, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On March 18, 1991, a writ of execution was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Consequently, on April 16, 1991, a notice of levy on execution on the real properties of the then deceased Mayor Nemencio Galvez, covered by TCT Nos.

In the case of Mayor Nemencio Galvez, in particular, he had ceased to hold office when he was replaced by an officer-in-charge on or about May 12, 1986, and thereafter, on September 14, 1986, he died from an acute myocardial infraction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Rule 3, Section 18 of the Rules of Court, provides that:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 18. <i>Death or separation of a party who is a government officer.</i> - When an officer of the Philippines is a party in an action and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action may be continued and maintained by or against his successor, if within thirty (30) days after the successor takes office it is satisfactorily shown to the court that there is substantial need for so continuing and maintaining it. Substitution pursuant to this rule may be made when it is shown by supplemental pleading that the succesor of an officer adopts or continues or threatens to adopt or continue the action of his predecessor in enforcing a law averred to be in violation of the Constitution of the Philippines. Before a substitution is made, the party or officer to be affected, unless expressly assenting thereto, shall be given reasonable notice of the application therefor and accorded an opportunity to object."</blockquote>Considering the attendant circumstances in the case at bench, the failure to make the substitution pursuant to the aforequoted provision is a <i>procedural</i> defect.&nbsp; We bear in mind that the case out of which this petition arose is in the nature of a petition for mandamus and prohibition which sought to compel the then mayor, Dr. Nemencio Galvez, to issue the municipal license and permit to resume operations of the Balagtas Sports Arena at Balagtas, Bulacan, and to enjoin the said mayor and the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan, from implementing its Resolution No. 08-85 which ordered the closure of the cockpit arena. When the said public officials were replaced by OICs as an aftermath of the 1986 Edsa Revolution, it was incumbent upon private respondent Mendoza, through her counsel, to file for a substitution of parties within thirty (30) days after the named successors-in-office of Mayor Galvez and the members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan, assumed office. Inasmuch as no such substitution was effected, the mandamus petition cannot prosper in the absence of a supplemental pleading showing that the successors of Mayor Galvez and the members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan, had adopted or had continued or threatened to adopt or continue the action of their predecessors in enforcing the assailed resolution which ordered the closure of the subject cockpit arena.&nbsp; In fact, there is reason to believe petitioners’ claim that the appointed OIC no longer pursued the "closure policy" of Mayor Galvez so that the corresponding license and permit to operate the Balagtas Sports Arena were subsequently granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, the mandamus petition should have been dismissed for non-compliance with the substitution procedure pursuant to Rule 3, Section 18 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The assailed decision dated May 6, 1988 was rendered a couple of years after the Mayor and members of the Municipal Council of Balagtas, Bulacan, originally sued by private respondent Mendoza had ceased to hold public office. As initiator of the mandamus petition, counsel for private respondent Mendoza had ample time to make a proper substitution of parties had there still been compelling reasons to obtain the writs of mandamus and prohibition prayed for at the earliest possible time.&nbsp; As it was, there were none. The records fail to show that both private respondents had refuted the petitioners’ claim that, with the replacement of the late Mayor Galvez, the mandamus petition had become moot and academic after private respondent Mendoza obtained the municipal license and permit from the said mayor’s successor-in-office.&nbsp; Thus, when no proper substitution of parties was seasonably effected under Rule 3, Section 18 of the Rules of Court, the court a quo acted in excess of jurisdiction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> for having rendered the assailed decision against the petitioners in utter violation of their constitutional right to due process of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> We quote with approval our pronouncement in the case of <u>Allied Banking Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al.,</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><blockquote>"x x x We have ruled time and again that no man shall be affected by a proceeding to which he is a stranger.[63] It is a fundamental doctrine of law that a party, to be affected by a personal judgment must have a day in court and an opportunity to be heard.[64] To rule otherwise would be to render nugatory the due process clause of the Constitution."</blockquote>Consequently, the levy on execution and the execution sale that transpired to satisfy the lower court’s judgment rendered on May 6, 1988 in excess of jurisdiction for lack of due process cannot be given any legal effect. The present certiorari petition must be given due course. In this regard, we reiterate our ruling that:<br><blockquote>"Even when appeal is available and is the proper remedy, this Court has allowed a writ of certiorari when the orders of the lower court were issued either in excess of or without jurisdiction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote>The acts of the respondent sheriff in implementing the writ of execution, issued by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on May 18, 1991, which eventually resulted in the issuance of a Final Deed of Sale in favor of private respondent Manuel which covered real property under TCT No. T-307783, sold at public auction in satisfaction of the money judgment against the late Mayor and the members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Balagtas, Bulacan, have no legal effect since the said acts were founded upon a void judgment. The lower court’s Order, dated December 14, 1994, directing the Register of Deeds of Bulacan to issue a new title in favor of private respondent Manuel after cancellation of TCT No. T-307783, likewise, has no legal effect.&nbsp; As we have held in the case of <u>Gomez v. Concepcion.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><blockquote>"x x x A void judgment is in legal effect no judgment.&nbsp; By it no rights are divested. From it no rights can be obtained. Being worthless in itself all proceedings founded upon it are equally worthless. It neither binds nor bars any one. All acts performed under it and all claims flowing out of it are void. The parties attempting to enforce it may be responsible as trespassers. <u>The purchaser at a sale by virtue of its authority finds himself without title and without redress.</u>" (Italics supplied)</blockquote>We take this occasion as an opportunity to caution sheriffs with respect to making levies on execution and conducting execution sales that pertain to deceased parties against whom money judgments are adjudged, so that they may remember to study their lessons well and to exercise extreme care in performing their duties in order to avoid any prejudice that maybe caused thereby.<br><br>Considering that the assailed decision rendered by the lower court on May 6, 1988 is a void judgment, it is no longer necessary to determine whether or not proper service on the late mayor’s lawyer-son of a copy of the said decision was valid to reckon the date of its finality inasmuch as a void judgment never acquires finality and any action to declare its nullity does not prescribe. It can be attacked at anytime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The respondent Court of Appeals committed error in dismissing the petitioner’s certiorari petition on mere technicalities considering that the lower court’s judgment being assailed before it was a judgment by default which is frowned upon by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Even granting, arguendo, that the assailed decision was. valid, the respondent apellate court should have realized that the enforcement of the money judgment contained therein should have been made in the proper estate proceedings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the late mayor, Dr. Nemencio Galvez.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> All acts, orders, and processes resulting from and in pursuance of the execution of the assailed decision of the court a quo, particularly, the writ of execution dated May 18, 1991, the notice of levy on execution on April 16, 1991, the execution sale on April 13, 1993 and the Certificate of Sale dated April 13, 1993, the Final Deed of Sale, dated April 20, 1994 and the Orders of the court a quo dated May 30, 1988, April 6, 1989, November 12, 1990, July 4, 1994, October 21, 1994 and December 14, 1994, are hereby nullified and set aside.<br><br>The Register of Deeds of Bulacan is hereby directed to: (1) cancel the annotations of levy at the back of TCT Nos.
