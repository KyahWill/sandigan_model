				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On 20 September 1989, Eduardo T. Sabban, the appellant herein, together with four others, were accused of Robbery with Homicide in an information that read:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned Assistant City Prosecutor accuses EDUARDO SABBAN Y TOBESORA, JOHN DOE, PETER DOE, CHARLIE DOE, and DOUGLAS DOE, the last four (4) accused, whose true names and whereabouts have not as yet been ascertained, of the crime of Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code), committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about the 2nd day of September, 1989, in Quezon City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, conspiring together, confederating with and mutually helping one another, with intent to gain and by means of violence upon person, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously rob NANCY MAXEY Y IBARLES of the following:<br><br>"Assorted pieces of jewelry Two (2) firearms<br>"Cash money<br><br>"with an aggregate amount of P250,000.00, Philippine Currency, and on the occasion of said robbery, the said accused, pursuant to their conspiracy with intent to kill and without any justifiable cause, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of NANCY MAXEY Y IBARLES by stabbing her on the different parts of her body and strangling her maid NORA MERCADO Y LADEGNON with an electrical cord, causing injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of their death, to the damage and prejudice of their heirs in the aforementioned amount and in such other amount as may be awarded to them under the provisions of the Civil Code.<br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </blockquote>From what the prosecution could present, the following events took place:<br><br>On 03 September 1989, at around two o’clock in the afternoon, Nancy Maxey, an engineer assigned at the Manila Water and Sewerage System ("MWSS") laboratory, and her maid Nora Mercado were found dead inside their residence at No. 25 Windsor St., Fairview, Quezon City. The remains were discovered by Barnevelt Maxey, Nancy’s eighteen-year old nephew, who stated that when he went to the victims’ residence, he noticed that the gate was unlocked. He entered the premises and rang the doorbell of the house; nobody responded. Seeing that the entrance door was also unlocked, he went in. Inside, he glanced at the maid’s quarters whose door was evidently left open and, peering into the room, he saw what appeared to be the lifeless body of Nora Mercado with a wire tied around her neck. Barnevelt ran outside the house to ask for help. Soon police investigators from the Fairview Police Substation were at the scene. Barnevelt was asked to open the room of his aunt Nancy where they found the room drawers open and a jewelry box ransacked. Nancy’s body was discovered in the comfort room bathed in her own pool of blood in the bathtub.<br><br>The medico-legal officer, who conducted an autopsy examination, found the following injuries to have been sustained by the victims:<br><blockquote><u>"NANCY MAXEY:</u><br><br>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ligature mark, neck, measuring 30 by 0.5 cm., around the neck.<br><br>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, neck, measuring 3 by 1 cm, 6.5 cm. left of the anterior midline.<br><br>"(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, neck, measuring 2 by 0.5, 8 cm. left of the anterior midline.<br><br>"(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, right lateral aspect of the neck, measuring 3 by 0.7 cm., 13 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, right lateral aspect of the neck, measuring 2.5 by 0.8 cm., 12.5 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, right supraclavicular region, measuring 0.7 by 0.2 cm., 9.5 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, right supraclavicular region, measuring 2 by 0.5 cm., 9.5 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, neck, measuring 2 by 0.5 cm., 3 cm. left of the anterior midline.<br><br>"(9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, left supraclavicular region, measuring 2 by 0.8 cm., 9 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(10)&nbsp; Stab wound, left supraclavicular region, measuring 2 by 0.5 cm., 11 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(11)&nbsp; Stab wound, interclavicular region, measuring 0.8 by 0.2 cm., along the anterior midline.<br><br>"(12)&nbsp; Stab wound, right infraclavicular region, measuring 2 by 0.6 cm., 5.5 cm. from the anterior midline.<br><br>"(13)&nbsp; Stab wound, chest, measuring 2 by 0.6 cm., 3 cm. left of the anterior midline.<br><br>"(14)&nbsp; Stab wound, nape, measuring 3 by 0.7 cm., 4 cm. left of the posterior midline.<br><br>"(15)&nbsp; Stab wound, nape, measuring 2.2 by 0.7 cm., 5 cm. left of the posterior midline.<br><br>"(16)&nbsp; Stab wound, left shoulder, measuring 2 by 0.7 cm., 6 cm. from the posterior midline.<br><br>"(17)&nbsp; Stab wound, left shoulder, measuring 2 by 0.7 cm., 7 cm. from the posterior midline.<br><br>"(18)&nbsp; Stab wound, left shoulder, measuring 2 by 0.6 cm., 8 cm. from the posterior midline.<br><br>"(19)&nbsp; Stab wound, right shoulder, measuring 1.5 by 0.5 cm., 6.5. cm. from the posterior midline.<br><br>"(20)&nbsp; Stab wound, right shoulder, measuring 3 by 1 cm., 11 cm from the posterior midline.<br><br>"(21)&nbsp; Ligature mark, left wrist, measuring 16 by 4 cm., around the wrist.<br><br>"(22)&nbsp; Ligature mark, right wrist, measuring 14.5 by 4 cm. around the wrist.<br><br>"<u>NORA MERCADO: NECK</u><br><br>"(1) Ligature mark, neck, measuring 12 by 1.5 cm.<br><br>"(2) Multiple abrasions, neck, measuring 15 by 6.5. cm., bisected by the anterior midline.<br><br><u>"TRACHEA AND ESOPHAGUS:</u><br><br>"The trachea and esophagus are congested.

Vaginal and peri-urethral smears are negative for gramnegative diplococci and for spermatozoa."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Cesar Agbayani testified that on 02 September 1989, at about eight o’clock in the morning, he went to the house of Nancy Maxey to ask her about his job application. The maid, Nora Mercado, let him in. While Agbayani was still waiting for Nancy, the doorbell rang. The maid attended to the visitors but she did not allow them in. It was Nancy Maxey herself who opened the gate when informed of the guests. Two men came in. The first man to enter was the accused who introduced himself to the witness as "Eddie" and as the former driver of Nancy. Agbayani recalled having been later asked casually by the accused on who else were inside the house at the time. The two men left at approximately eleven o’clock in the morning.<br><br>Engr. Cesar Deperio had a contract with MWSS, and he personally knew Nancy Maxey to whom he used to present some samples for testing at the laboratory. Deperio stated that about a year back, Sabban resigned from his company because Sabban’s wife, then a househelper of Nancy, was severely scolded by the latter.<br><br>Jesus Caacbay testified that in November of 1988, at around seven o’clock in the evening, Sabban, a company driver, approached him and said, in Ilocano, "I am leaving my job. There will be a time, (when) I will be back to (have my) revenge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Eduardo Sabban was arrested in Cagayan and brought to the Quezon City Jail. During investigation, he confessed to his having taken part in the killing of Nancy Maxey and Nora Mercado. He executed, with the assistance of counsel, a Sworn Statement detailing how the victims were killed and the participation of the other assailants, namely, Victor Cordova, Benito Esperanza, Reynante Maladrigo and Rey Lasam in the commission of the crime.<br><br>When his turn to be at the witness stand came, Eduardo Sabban narrated a different story. He asserted that he arrived at the Pantranco Terminal in Quezon Boulevard, Quezon City, in the morning of 02 September 1989 from Cagayan. At the bus station, he chanced upon Victor Cordova, a townmate. Cordova said he needed to borrow P200.00. Sabban replied that he only had enough cash to buy the jeepney spare parts ordered by his mother-in-law but that should there be any extra sum left, he would be happy to lend it. First, however, Sabban had to see Nancy Maxey in Fairview to inform her that his sister Virgie, who also used to be a housemaid for Nancy, would no longer be back for work. Cordova agreed to accompany Sabban. The two went to, and stayed awhile at, Nancy’s residence. When they finally left at about eleven o’clock in the morning, Cordova suddenly pulled the accused aside and angrily demanded P200.00 from the latter. Out of fear, the accused gave the amount. Cordova then boarded a passenger jeepney bound for Muñoz market while Sabban proceeded to Roosevelt Avenue where he finally was able to buy the jeepney spare parts. Sabban then rushed to the Pantranco Station to board a bus bound for Tuguegarao, Cagayan.<br><br>In a decision, handed down on 29 April 1991, by the trial court,[4] the accused was held guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide; viz:<br><br>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused EDUARDO SABBAN y TOBESURA GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide as defined in Art. 294, Par. 1 of the R.P.C., as charged in the information, this Court hereby sentences him to suffer an imprisonment of double RECLUSION PERPETUA for the death of Nancy Maxey and Nora Mercado, to pay the heirs of Nancy Maxey and Nora Mercado as compensatory damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each and to pay the cost."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The accused appealed to this Court with the following submissions: That -<br><br>"1. The lower court erred in convicting accused, Eduardo T. Sabban, of the crime of Robbery with Homicide for the killing of Nancy Maxey Y Ibarles contrary to the facts and evidence presented by the accused.<br><br>"2. The lower court erred in considering inadmissible evidence in violation of the constitutional rights of the accused.<br><br>"3. The lower court erred in admitting the affidavit of Eduardo T. Sabban (Exhibit `S’) x x x taken in violation of the constitutional rights of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The main line of defense, it thus appears, is an alleged violation of the constitutional right of appellant to be assisted by a counsel of his own choice in the execution, during custodial investigation, of his sworn statement admitting his participation in the crime.<br><br>The evidence does not bear up to the contention.<br><br>Pertinent portions of the testimony of Pat.
