Efren Peralta who was then in the Court house, to appear in the hearing of his two cases, for the undersigned to file sick leave of absence for immediate medical check-up and treatment, thus explaining the circumstance of having signed the Order of Release although on sick leave of absence on said day, that it was performed before undersigned finally decided to go on sick leave when the pains and aching was beyond the point of human endurance following the cancellation of the hearing of the two scheduled cases, affidavit of Atty.

Villareal, in their affidavits already marked as Annexes "G" and "I", which were nevertheless did not form part of the officials Records of the case, affidavit of undersigned hereto attached as Annex "O";<br><br>(pp. 16-21, Rollo.)<br></blockquote><br>A reading of Judge Tiong’s comment clearly shows that there is no factual issue involved. He admits that on August 15, 1994 he signed the bailbond and the Order of Release of Ernesto Tugade, the accused in Criminal Case No. 2859-A, pending before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 54, Alaminos, Pangasinan and presided over by Judge Paz.<br><br>Respondent had absolutely no authority to approve the bailbond and issue the order of release. He totally ignored or disregarded Section 14 of Rule 114, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 14. <i>Bail, where filed.</i> - (a) Bail in the amount fixed may be filed with the court where the case is pending, or, in the absence or unavailability of the judge thereof, with another branch of the same court within the province or city. If the accused is arrested in a province, city or municipality other than where the case is pending, bail may be filed also with any regional trial court of said place, or, if no judge thereof is available, with any metropolitan trial judge, municipal trial judge or municipal circuit trial judge therein.</b></blockquote><br><br>As afore-stated, Criminal Case No. 2859-A was pending before Branch 54 of the Regional Trial Court stationed in Alaminos, Pangasinan, and only said Regional Trial Court may approve the bailbond and issue the order of release.&nbsp; The record is devoid of any showing ,that no RTC judge was available to act on the bailbond.&nbsp; Neither does the record show that the accused was arrested in another province, city, or municipality.&nbsp; Repondent judge, therefore, had no reason or authority to act as he did.<br><br>The defense interposed by respondent that "it appears that the said Order of Release issued by the undersigned did not form part of the official records of the case, neither has it been utilized in the release of the accused nor served any purpose whatsoever in connection with the case" is unavailing.&nbsp; It is immaterial whether or not the order of release issued by him was used by the accused in obtaining his release. Respondent judge is charged with approving the bailbond and issuing the order of release.<br><br>His further defense that at the time he approved the bailbond he had a "vivid recollection" of an order of the Regional Trial Court of Alaminos, Pangasinan, "granting the accused Ernesto Tugade the right to bail, a bond fixed by the said court in the amount of P50,000.00" is obviously a figment of his imagination. According to Judge Paz, a motion for bail was filed on August 10, 1994 and set for hearing on August 16, 1994. However, respondent approved the bail bond and issued the order of release on August 15, 1994, or one day before the motion for bail was heard by Judge Paz.<br><br>Respondent’s other excuse that he was on leave of absence on August 15, 1994, is likewise immaterial. As a matter of fact, it would make matters worse for him if he were on leave of absence on August 15, 1994 for then he would have absolutely no authority to discharge the duties or exercise the powers of a judge.<br><br>A judge’s conduct should be above reproach, and in the discharge of his judicial duties he should be conscientious, studious, thorough, courteous, patient, punctual, just, impartial x x x (paragraph 31, Code of Judicial Ethics). It is patent that respondent Judge Tiong was remiss in observing the conduct expected of a member of the judiciary.&nbsp; He failed to exert such conscientiousness, studiousness, and thoroughness expected and demanded of a judge.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> respondent Judge Antonio V. Tiong is hereby found guilty of abuse of authority and ordered to pay a fine in the amount of Three Thousand (P3,000.00) Pesos.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J. (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Francisco, and Panganiban, JJ.,</i> concur.<br></div><br>
