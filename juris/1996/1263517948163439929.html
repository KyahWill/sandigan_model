Guayco with the approval of Provincial Fiscal Eustaquio Z. Gacott, Jr., for the cancellation of the bail bonds of the accused and the issuance of a warrant for their arrest in view of the filing of the information for murder which recommended no bond for them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On 30 October 1987, Judge Guerra ordered the case archived and directed the issuance of an alias warrant of arrest since no return was made of the warrant of arrest issued on 10 February 1987.&nbsp; Two more alias warrants of arrest were subsequently issued, but no returns were likewise made.&nbsp; Thus, on 12 July 1988, Judge Guerra directed the Station Commander of Narra, Palawan, to show cause and explain why he should not be held for indirect contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On 15 December 1988, accused Gonzalo Galas was turned over to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Whether he voluntarily surrendered or was arrested is unclear from the record.&nbsp; Since the other accused remained outside the jurisdiction of the court and the warrants for their arrest had not been returned, Judge Guerra, on 12 July 1988, again directed the Station Commander of Narra, Palawan, to explain why he should not be held for indirect contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 9 May 1989, with Judge Angel Miclat as the new presiding Judge of Branch 48, accused Gonzalo Galas was finally arraigned.&nbsp; As he entered a plea of not guilty, the court scheduled the pre-trial and initial trial of the case, as against him, on 5 and 6 July 1989.&nbsp; The court further issued another alias warrant of arrest for the other accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 4 October 1989, with another judge, Judge Amor A.

Belen, with the approval of Acting Provincial Prosecutor Clarito Demaala, filed a Motion to Admit Amended Information which now charges the accused with <i>Homicide.</i>&nbsp; As ground for the downgrading of the offense charged, Prosecutor Belen alleged that the reinvestigation disclosed no evidence of evident premeditation nor treachery, and the victim even had the opportunity to wound accused Gonzalo Galas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On 29 January 1990, Criminal Case No. 6233 was transferred to Branch 47 of the RTC of Palawan, which was then presided by Judge Eustaquio Z.

He was then called and challenged to a fight by Federico Gamayon, and when he approached Federico, the latter stabbed him with a bolo.&nbsp; He grabbed his bolo and used it to defend himself.&nbsp; He retreated; but Federico still hit him.&nbsp; They hacked each other.&nbsp; Federico fell; Gonzalo went home to ask for help to get to the doctor.&nbsp; He was brought to the doctor by Maximo Delgado and Joel Buncag.&nbsp; The medical certificate issued to him (Exhibit "1") by the doctor indicates that he was wounded on the right arm and on the left part of his abdomen.&nbsp; According to Gonzalo, nobody witnessed the fight and nobody helped him fight Federico.&nbsp; He asserted that he had no previous quarrel with Federico and that the latter was drunk that night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On their part, accused Josue and Noe Galas declared that on the date and time Federico was killed, they were in Tigsiapo, Apu-aporaoan, Aborlan, Palawan, which is five kilometers away from the scene of the crime, where they were hauling palay for Sergio Gabileo.&nbsp; They came to know of the incident only the day after it happened."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Accused Maximo Delgado testified that on 23 December 1985 at 9:00 p.m., he was in his house in Tinagong Dagat, Narra, Palawan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> about half a kilometer away from Gonzalo's home.&nbsp; He was summoned by Gonzalo's wife and one Joel Buncag to help bring Gonzalo to the hospital.&nbsp; He denied having inflicted any injury upon Federico.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Accused Dimas Akma testified that on 23 December 1985 at 9:00 p.m. he was at Sandoval, Narra, Palawan, at the house of one Decena which is approximately three kilometers away from the scene of the crime.&nbsp; At that time they had just finished threshing palay for Sergio Gabileo and were roasting chicken for a little get-together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The accused also presented corroborating witnesses, <i>viz.,</i> (a) Joel Buncag, who said he saw Federico hack Gonzalo; and that the two eyewitnesses, Crisanto Gamayon and Joemar Deocadiz, as well as the four other accused were not at the scene of the crime when the killing occurred; however, Maximo Delgado arrived to help bring Gonzalo to the hospital;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (b) Policarpio Gabello, who corroborated the testimony of Maximo Delgado who had said that his only participation was to help bring Gonzalo to the hospital for treatment and that of Dimas Akma who had said that he was in the house of one Decena at the time of the killing;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and (c) Sergio Gabileo, who corroborated the testimonies of accused Josue Galas and Noe Galas who earlier testified that they were on his farm hauling palay on the day of the killing and that the two slept in his house that night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In its decision dated 23 August 1993,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the trial court found all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as charged, and rendered judgment as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court hereby holds that the prosecution has proven the guilt of the accused Gonzalo Galas, Noel Galas, Josue Galas, Maximo Delgado and Dimas Akma beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for having mutually helped, connived and conspired with each other in killing the victim, Federico Gamayon with treachery, evident premeditation and the use of superior strength.&nbsp; They are, therefore, sentenced each to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to indemnify the heirs of the victim the sum of P150,000.00 (or P30,000.00 each accused) as actual, moral and exemplary damages, with costs.<br><br>With this conviction that makes the accused herein maximum security prisoners, they are hereby ordered shipped immediately to the national penitentiary, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, to serve their sentence there.</blockquote>The accused seasonably filed their notice of appeal and in their Appellants' Brief they impute upon the trial court the commission of the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LOSS OF JURISDICTION IN RELYING ENTIRELY ON THE MANIFESTLY PERJURED TESTIMONY OF THE TWO SUPPOSED EYEWITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION AND IN DISREGARDING EVIDENCE FAVORABLE TO THE ACCUSED;<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LOSS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT ACCORDING ACCUSED THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE PRESUMED INNOCENT AND TO AN IMPARTIAL TRIBUNAL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>In the first assigned error the accused make it appear that the relationship between the deceased and the two main witnesses diminishes the potency of their testimony.&nbsp; Such emphasis is misplaced.&nbsp; This Court has held in a number of cases that relationship between the witnesses and the deceased does not automatically impair the credibility of the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We have likewise held that a witness' relationship to a victim, far from rendering his testimony biased, would even render it more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in vindicating the crime to accuse somebody other than the real culprit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> They have a definite stake at seeing, the guilty person brought before the courts so that justice may be served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It is not to be lightly supposed that relatives of the victim would callously violate their conscience to avenge the death of a dear one by blaming it on persons who are in fact innocent of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>They also put in issue the age of one of the main witnesses, Joemar Deocadiz, who was five years old when he allegedly witnessed the killing.<br><br>It must be stressed that Joemar's age does not disqualify him as a witness.&nbsp; Section 20, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides that all persons who can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others, may be witnesses.&nbsp; The exceptions thereto are found in the succeeding Section 20 and, insofar as children are concerned, only those whose mental maturity is such so as to render them incapable of perceiving the facts respecting which they are examined and of relating truthfully are disqualified.&nbsp; It is thus clear that any child, regardless of age, can be a competent witness if they meet the following criteria: (a) capacity of observation, (b) capacity of recollection, and (c) capacity of communication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The accused urge us to give no weight to Joemar's testimony because of its unreliability; they claim that he could not even remember the month and the year when the incident happened.&nbsp; A close scrutiny of his testimony discloses, however, that Joemar was clear on the facts he observed surrounding the death of Federico which, according to him took place on a date "nearing Christmas."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Since the date of Federico's death was undubitably established to be 23 December 1985, which was, indeed, "nearing Christmas," Joemar's approximation was sufficient.<br><br>The accused also harp on Crisanto Gamayon's credibility on the ground that if he were really there, he would have unquestionably helped his father instead of merely standing still and simply gaping at the latter's killing by five men and returning to the scene only on the following day.&nbsp; Crisanto's testimony that he was afraid<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> sufficiently refutes this objection.&nbsp; Fear has been known to render people immobile, if not useless, in some life-and-death situations.&nbsp; Crisanto and Joemar left Federico's body overnight at the scene. of the crime because darkness had fallen and fear gripped them.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the 16-year old Crisanto and the 5-year old Joemar could not be expected to act like adults, in full possession of their mental emotional, and psychological faculties.<br><br>In the second assigned error, the accused insist that Gonzalo Galas alone killed Federico Gamayon in self-defense; and assuming arguendo that self-defense was not found to be satisfactorily established, an impartial tribunal could not but rule that the crime committed was not murder, but only homicide.<br><br>In its Appellee's Brief filed by the Office of the Solicitor General, the People agree with the trial. court except as to its order directing each of the accused to pay P30,000.00 to the heirs of the victim as indemnity, which, it submits, is not in accord with Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code and prevailing jurisprudence on the matter.&nbsp; They should be held solidarity liable in the amount of P50,000.00 pursuant to <i>People vs.&nbsp; Macam.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>We have no doubt whatsoever that prosecution witnesses Crisanto Gamayon and Joemar Deocadiz were with Federico Gamayon on that fateful evening of 23 December 1985.&nbsp; But, whether their testimony given only after the lapse of five years presented an authentic picture of what actually happened is an entirely different matter, especially as regards the accused Josue Galas, Noe Galas, Dimas Acma, and Maximo Delgado whose alibis have, nevertheless, to be rejected in light of their positive identification by Crisanto and Joemar.&nbsp; It is doctrinally settled that alibi cannot prevail over and is worthless in the face of the positive identification by prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Our meticulous scrutiny: of the evidence discloses that accused Josue Galas, Noe Galas, Dimas Acma, and Maximo Delgado were not with accused Gonzalo Galas when the latter and Federico Gamayon met for the first time.&nbsp; They arrived at the scene of the incident after accused Gonzalo Galas had hacked Federico with a bolo and the latter had fallen.&nbsp; Then and there they "ganged up" (according to Crisanto) or "mauled" (according to Joemar) Federico.&nbsp; Thus, on direct examination, Crisanto testified:<br><blockquote><b>PROSECUTOR DELOVINO:</b><br><br><center>x x x</center><br><br><b>Q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said you were in that place, what happened in that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thus:<br><blockquote><b>PROSECUTOR DELOVINO:</b><br><br><b>Q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said that Federico Gamayon was ganged up or mauled <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If full credit is to be given to Crisanto and Joemar, the answer would be in the affirmative.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no convincing evidence that proves that the wounds sustained by Federico Gamayon were inflicted by two persons with the use of two different weapons to justify a conclusion that anyone of Gonzales' co-accused also stabbed Federico with the use of another weapon.&nbsp; Dr. Hubo was uncertain as to the first.&nbsp; He merely stated that they could have been caused by <i>one</i> or <i>two</i> persons.&nbsp; Thus:<br><blockquote><b>FISCAL DELOVINO:</b><br><br><b>Q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thus:<br><blockquote><b>ATTY.&nbsp; AUSTRIA:</b><br><br><center>x x x</center><br><b>Q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a possibility that there is only one instrument that was used by the <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thus:<br><blockquote><b>ATTY.&nbsp; DE LOS REYES:</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will repeat for emphasis, your Honor.<br><b>Q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes, sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></blockquote>There is, as well, no evidence that the "mauling" or clubbing" by Gonzalo Galas' co-accused had produced any injury on any part of Federico's body.&nbsp; Dr. Hubo explained that he failed to detect any contusions nor abrasions because the cadaver was covered with mud due to occasional showers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The People suggest, however, that the failure of&nbsp; Dr. Hubo to detect the contusions or abrasions does not mean that Federico did not sustain any injury from the mauling or clubbing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This is plain speculation which finds no support in the rule on evidence in criminal cases.<br><br>Furthermore, there is no evidence on record that Gonzalo Galas was with his co-accused when he called Federico Gamayon, or that all the accused arrived simultaneously at the place where Federico was hacked by Gonzalo.&nbsp; While Gonzalo's co-accused were seen at the scene of the crime by Crisanto and Joemar, no clear and convincing evidence can support a conclusion that the said co-accused were able to inflict any injury - either a stab or hack wound with the use of a bolo, or contusion, abrasion, or hematoma with the use of pieces of wood - on Federico.&nbsp; There is, as well, absolutely no evidence of conspiracy among Gonzalo and his co-accused as to make each of the latter equally liable for all the acts of Gonzalo under the doctrine that once conspiracy is established the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Crisanto and Joemar may have thus miscomprehended or misappreciated the sequence of events after the arrival of Gonzalo's co-accused.<br><br>We cannot fully agree with the trial courts' unqualified reliance on the testimonies of Crisanto and Joemar, nor cast our imprimatur on its assessment of the said witnesses' credibility pursuant to the rule that the issue of credibility is addressed to the trial court since it heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> For one, the trial court overlooked the foregoing facts, viz., infliction of the wounds by one person with the use of one weapon, and the absence of any injury caused by the mauling or clubbing.&nbsp; Excepted from the rule on the binding character of the trial court's assessment of credibility of witnesses are instances when trial courts have overlooked, misapplied, and misinterpreted facts and circumstances of great weight and value which would affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>For another, Judge Gacott, who tried the case, heard the witnesses, and rendered the decision, cannot be said to have possessed the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.&nbsp; As noted early on in this ponencia, he approved, in his capacity as the Provincial Fiscal, the motion of Third Assistant Provincial Fiscal Reynaldo R. Guayco to cancel the bail bonds of the accused and to issue the warrant of their arrest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> in view of the filing of the information for murder which recommended no bond for the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> As such, Judge Gacott, as the then Provincial Fiscal, was deemed to have concurred with the view of Fiscal Guayco that the evidence of guilt of the accused in this case was strong.&nbsp; In light of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> he must have read the supporting evidence, such as the sworn statements of Crisanto Gamayon and Joemar Deocadiz.&nbsp; Finally, after the case was transferred from Branch 48 to his branch - Branch 47 - Judge Gacott denied the prosecution's motion to admit an amended information charging the accused with the lesser offense of homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Such acts merely evinced his belief in the trustworthiness of the testimony of Crisanto and Joemar and an impression of prejudgment is thus unavoidable.<br><br>Under these circumstances, it was discretionary upon Judge Gacott to voluntarily inhibit himself pursuant to Section 1(2), Rule 137 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and returned the case to Branch 48 where it originated.&nbsp; However, while Judge Gacott's voluntary inhibition would have been preferable, it cannot be said that his failure caused substantial prejudice to the accused.&nbsp; Initially, let it be clear that Judge Gacott's previous participation in the case as Provincial Fiscal was not raised either before us nor the court a quo.&nbsp; On this score, it has been held:<br><blockquote>[T]he disqualification of a judge is not a matter that affects his jurisdiction and power to act such as to render his decision null and void, so much so that failure on the part of a party, to timely interpose such an objection of disqualification prior to the decision has been held to be a fatal obstacle to raising such objection on appeal.&nbsp; In Government of the Philippines vs.&nbsp; Abella [49 Phil. 374-378], we held: ... The attorneys for the appellants should have been familiar with the pleadings in the cause, as well as other documents in the record.&nbsp; Reference to these would at once have revealed the fact that Judge Carballo had participated administratively to the extent above stated.&nbsp; A litigant, having these facts before him, cannot be permitted to speculate upon the action of a court and raise an objection to this sort after [the] decision has been rendered.&nbsp; The grounds for disqualification specified in Section 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure (now Rule 137) supply matter for preliminary exception, and timely objection should be submitted in writing as is require d in said section.&nbsp; The inadvertent failure of the court to disqualify himself in the case there mentioned does not supply a ground for reversing the judgment.; but of course if this court were of the opinion that the litigant had not had a fair trial, a new trial could be granted....<br><br><center>x x x</center><br>The question of a judge's disqualification, therefore, is one that should be timely raised in the first instance, so that it may properly be raised and considered on appeal.&nbsp; At the same time ... if this Court were of the opinion upon a review of the case that the litigant had not, had a fair trial, it would grant a new trial, although the judge may not have been disqualified under Rule 137, not on the ground of lack of jurisdiction but in the best interests of justice....<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote>Further, given that the guarantee of an impartial judge concerns itself with procedural due process<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> any defect therein may be waived as implied above and is subject to the curative effect of filing a motion for reconsideration or an appeal.<br><br>That Crisanto and Joemar could have misapprehended or misappreciated the events, especially as to the participation of Josue Galas, Noe Galas, Dimas Acma, and Maximo Delgado, could easily be deduced from the fact that the incident occurred at nighttime; Crisanto was "a little bit far"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>from his father, and he ran away.&nbsp; Joemar, who was only six years old, was sitting on a sled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> He did not testify as to his distance to Federico when the latter was attacked.<br><br>We have then serious doubts as to the culpability of accused Josue Galas, Noe Galas, Dimas Acma, and Maximo Delgado.&nbsp; Their acquittal is inevitable for failure of the prosecution to overcome the presumption of innocence which is guaranteed in Section 14(2), Article III of the Constitution.<br><br>The fate of accused Gonzalo Galas is entirely different.&nbsp; He admitted that he killed Federico Gamayon; however, he interposed self-defense to justify his act.&nbsp; The rule is unbending that where the accused admits the killing of the victim but invokes self-defense, it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in defense of himself, i.e., the burden is shifted to him to prove that the killing was justified and he incurred no criminal liability therefor.&nbsp; For that purpose, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's evidence for, even if the latter were weak, it would not be disbelieved after his open admission of responsibility for the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The three requisites of self-defense which accused Gonzalo Galas has to satisfy by clear and convincing evidence are: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, Federico Gamayon, (2) the reasonable necessity of the means he (Gonzalo) employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on his (Gonzalo's) part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The prosecution and Gonzalo Galas have contrariant versions as to how the incident started.&nbsp; The former claimed that when Federico was near Gonzalo's house, Gonzalo called the former who then approached the latter.&nbsp; The latter then suddenly hacked Federico with a bolo.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, Gonzalo contended that while he was helping a baby carabao nurse from its mother at a place about twenty meters from his house, Federico called and challenged him to a fight and when he approached Federico, the latter stabbed him with a bolo.&nbsp; He then grabbed his own bolo to defend himself and retreated; but since Federico still hit him, they hacked each other.<br><br>Assuming Gonzalo's version to be true and accurate, he, therefore, accepted a challenge to fight.&nbsp; Both had bolos with them.&nbsp; By accepting the challenge and immediately approaching Federico, Gonzalo placed himself in an unlawful status.&nbsp; Settled is the rule that when parties mutually agree to fight, it is immaterial who attacks or receives the wound first, for the first act of force is an incident of the fight itself and in nowise is it unwarranted and unexpected aggression which alone can legalize self-defense.&nbsp; A personal fight freely and voluntarily accepted creates an illegal state of affairs which comes within the sanction of criminal law, during which no application can be made to either party of the circumstances modifying criminal liability, arising from facts or accidents, physical or otherwise, of the fight itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Consequently, Gonzalo's claim of self-defense hardly merits even a semblance of sympathy.<br><br>That both had a fight was confirmed by Joemar in his answers during cross-examination.&nbsp; Thus:<br><blockquote><b>ATTY.&nbsp; DE LOS REYES:</b><br><br><b>Q</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So that you saw <u>the fight</u> between your uncle, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is no evidence that Gonzalo's wounds were self-inflicted and the speculation of the prosecution that they would have been inflicted by his co-accused remains speculative.&nbsp; The best evidence that Federico was unable to use his bolo was his bolo and its scabbard; yet, they were not presented.<br><br>The challenge hurled by Federico was not unmotivated.&nbsp; Crisanto provided the motive: Gonzalo did not pay Federico the rental for one year for the former's carabao which the latter leased.<br><br>The foregoing considered, we rule that accused Gonzalo Galas is liable only for the crime of homicide as defined and penalized in Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp;
