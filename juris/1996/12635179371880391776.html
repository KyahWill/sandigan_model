				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a <i>petition for certiorari and prohibition</i> under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court to set aside and annul the decision and orders of the public respondent dated 11 February 1993, 4 March 1993, 16 June&nbsp; 1993&nbsp; and 25 November 1993, respectively.<br><br>The facts which gave rise to the present petition are as follows:<br><br>On 27 June&nbsp; 1988, petitioner (formerly the Philippine Lingerie Corporation) filed a petition for certification election among its rank-and-file employees&nbsp; (docketed as NCR-OD-M-6-349-88).&nbsp; As a consequence thereof, two (2) unions sought recognition, namely:&nbsp; PHILIPPINE LINGERIE WORKERS UNION-ALAB and BUKLOD NG MANGGAGAWA NG PHILIPPINE LINGERIE CORPORATION.<br><br>In one of the pre-election conferences, PHILIPPINE LINGERIE WORKERS UNION-ALAB moved for the exclusion of a number of employees who were allegedly holding supervisory positions.<br><br>On 28 July 1988, Med-Arbiter Rasidali C. Abdullah issued an order denying the motion of PHILIPPINE LINGERIE CORPORATION WORKERS UNION-ALAB for lack of merit.&nbsp; Said order was appealed to the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR) which issued an Order on 16 November&nbsp; 1988,&nbsp; the dispositive portion of which declares:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Order dated 28 July 1988 is hereby affirmed.&nbsp; Accordingly, to ensure fairness to all the parties and in order to hasten the proceedings, let the election be conducted under the supervision of the Labor Organization Division, this Office, which is hereby directed to immediately set this case for pre-election conference.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>PHILIPPINE LINGERIE WORKERS UNION-ALAB filed two (2) separate motions for reconsideration of the above order which were consolidated and treated in an Order dated 22 December 1988, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the twin motions for reconsideration are hereby deemed denied for lack of merit.&nbsp; Accordingly, let the pre-election conference preparatory to the certification election proceed without further delay.<br><br>No further motion of similar nature shall be hereafter entertained.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>No further appeal of the above-quoted order was interposed, thus it became final and executory.<br><br>On 3 May 1989, a certification election was conducted with the votes of "supervisors and confidential" employees being challenged.&nbsp; Thus, the certification election showed the following results:<br><blockquote>1.Philippine Lingerie Workers Union-ALAB- - - - - - - - - - - - -318 votes<br><br>2.Buklod Ng&nbsp; Manggagawa Ng Philippine<br>Lingerie Corporation- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 412 votes<br><br>3.No Union - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 17 votes<br><br>4.Challenged Supervisors/Confidential<br><br>Employees- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <u>99 votes</u><br><br>TOTAL VALID VOTES CAST- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&nbsp; - - -855 votes<br><br>SPOILED BALLOTS- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -12 votes</blockquote>PHILIPPINE LINGERIE WORKERS UNION-ALAB filed an election protest which was later formalized on 25 May 1989.&nbsp; In the meantime, on 9 May 1989, BUKLOD moved for the opening of the challenged ballots.<br><blockquote>On 20 July&nbsp; 1989, the BLR, through its director Pura Ferrer-Calleja, issued an Order, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the protest and challenged (sic) of the Alyansang Likha Ng Mga Anak Ng Bayan (ALAB) are hereby denied for lack of merit.<br><br>Accordingly, let the challenged votes of the supervisors and confidential employees be opened in the presence of the parties under the supervision of the Labor Organization Division (LOD) on 26 July 1989 at 9:00 A.M., Bureau of Labor Relations.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>With the above-quoted order, the challenged votes were opened on 3 August 1989 and the results were as follows:<br><blockquote>Philippine Lingerie Workers Union-ALAB- - - - - - - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 votes<br><br>Buklod Ng Manggagawa Ng Phil.

(formerly Philippine Lingerie Corporation).<br><br>The management of Barbizon Philippines, Inc. is hereby directed to immediately start negotiating for a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the said union.<br><br>No further motion of any nature shall hereinafter be entertained by this Office.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>Not satisfied with the aforequoted order, PHILIPPINE LINGERIE WORKERS UNION-ALAB appealed to the Secretary of Labor but on 26 September 1989, the same was withdrawn and a motion to dismiss appeal with prejudice was filed by the same union.&nbsp; There being no more obstacle to collective bargaining, petitioner negotiated with BUKLOD as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative.<br><br>A Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) was signed by petitioner and BUKLOD which was effective for five (5) years or until 18 November 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>While the CBA was still in force, several employees organized themselves into the Nagkakaisang Supervisors Ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. (NSBPI) and the Nagkakaisang Excluded Monthly Paid Employees Ng Barbizon, Philippines, Inc. (NEMPEBPI) allegedly because they were excluded from the coverage of the existing CBA between petitioner and&nbsp; BUKLOD.<br><br>Two (2) separate petitions for certification election were filed by NSBPI and NEMPEBPI.&nbsp; The petition of the former was raffled to&nbsp; Med-Arbiter Renato D. Parungo and the latter to Med-Arbiter Paterno D. Adap.&nbsp; Both cases were dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>NSBPI appealed to the Office of the Secretary of Labor.&nbsp; On 29 December 1992, public respondent Undersecretary Bienvenido Laguesma denied the same for lack of merit.&nbsp;&nbsp; NSBPI moved for reconsideration on 15 January 1993.<br><br>On 11 February 1993, the Office of the Secretary of Labor, through public respondent rendered the questioned&nbsp; Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE the Motion for Reconsideration of Nagkakaisang Superbisor ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. (NSBPI) and the appeal of Nagkakaisang Excluded Monthly Paid Employees ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. (NEMPEBPI) are hereby granted and the Orders of this Office and the Med-Arbiter dated 29 December 1992 and 01 September 1992, respectively, are hereby SET ASIDE.<br><br>Accordingly, a new Order is hereby entered in the above-captioned cases directing the conduct of certification election among the subject employees excluded from the coverage of the bargaining unit of the existing CBA of rank and file employees aforestated, not otherwise excluded/disqualified by law.&nbsp; The choices are as follows:<br><br>1. Nagkakaisang Superbisor ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. (NSBPI)<br><br>2. Nagkakaisang Excluded Monthly Paid Employees ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. (NEMPEBPI); and,<br><br>3. No Union.<br><br>Let, therefore, the entire records of these consolidated cases be forwarded to the Regional Office of origin for the immediate conduct of certification election, subject to the usual pre-election conference.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> A second motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioner but it was likewise denied, this time, with finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Undaunted, petitioner filed a third motion for reconsideration which was also denied for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>Hence, this petition wherein the following issues were raised:<br><br><center>A</center><br>THE RESPONDENT "SUPERVISORS" LOCAL UNION CANNOT FORM A SUPERVISORS UNION, WHEN THEIR MEMBERS ARE INCOMPATIBLY "RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES"; MUCH LESS, CAN IT SEEK REPRESENTATION STATUS FOR SUPERVISORS, WHEN THE EMPLOYEES THEY WANT TO REPRESENT FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PURPOSES BELONG IN THE "APPROPRIATE BARGAINING UNIT" OF RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES ON THE "EMPLOYER WIDE UNIT", WHICH ALREADY HAS A CERTIFIED BARGAINING AGENT: BUKLOD NG MANGGAGAWA NG PHILIPPINE LINGERIE CORPORATION.<br><br><center>B</center><br>WORSE, SINCE THE MEMBERS OF THE RESPONDENT LOCAL UNION BELONG TO THE APPROPRIATE BARGAINING UNIT OF RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEES, THE EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH COVERS THEM, IS (A) "BAR" TO ITS CERTIFICATION ELECTION PETITION.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Barbizon Philippines, Inc. alleges that this petition only assails the resolution of the public respondent&nbsp; regarding NSBPI and does not include the NEMPEBPI, the union of the excluded monthly paid employees because the separate motion for reconsideration it filed in connection with the latter has not yet been resolved by the NLRC.<br><br>On 8 February 1994, this Court issued a temporary restraining order, enjoining the Bureau of Labor Relations from setting the pre-election conference in Case No. OS-MA-A-215-92-93 entitled "In Re: Petition for Certification Election among the Supervisory Employees of Barbizon Philippines, Inc., Nagkakaisang Supervisor Ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc.-OBRERO" and from conducting further proceedings in the aforesaid cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of the petition, the CBA expired.&nbsp; However, no other agreement between the parties was made known to this Court, thus, in accordance with Article XX of the CBA, it continues to be in force and shall govern the relations between the parties thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>We find no merit in the petition.<br><br>Petitioner maintains its stance that the petition for certification election filed by the Nagkakaisang Supervisor ng Barbizon Philippines., Inc. - NAFLU (NSBPI) must necessarily fail because the employees&nbsp; designated as "supervisors" cannot legally form a supervisors’ union by virtue of the BLR’s final decision dated 22 August 1989 declaring the abovementioned employees mere rank and file workers.&nbsp; Being part of the rank and file, petitioner avers that said employees belong to the "employer wide unit," which is the appropriate bargaining unit of all its rank and file employees and&nbsp; which is&nbsp; represented by the Buklod ng Manggagawa ng Philippine Lingerie Corporation (BUKLOD) as the sole certified bargaining agent.<br><br>Petitioner further asserts that the Undersecretary of Labor committed grave abuse of discretion in granting NSBPI’s petition for certification election as this was tantamount to an unjustifiable reversal of the BLR’s final ruling that the subject employees are not supervisory employees, but merely rank and file, due to the nature of their duties and functions.<br><br>Petitioner’s reasoning is flawed, proceeding as it does from the wrong premise.&nbsp; Petitioner obstinately believes that NSBPI’s petition for certification election was granted because the employees carrying the appellation "supervisor" were deemed supervisory employees.&nbsp; The status of the subject employees, however, is not the issue in the case at bar.&nbsp; Their status as&nbsp; "supervisors" is not in dispute.&nbsp; The aforestated decision of the BLR dated 22 August 1989 has settled with finality that said employees are merely rank and file and this fact has been accepted by the petitioning union NSBPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> NSBPI’s petition for certification election was granted because the subject employees, including petitioner’s monthly paid employees, were expressly excluded from the bargaining unit and from the coverage of the CBA executed between petitioner and BUKLOD, as clearly stated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This is the real reason behind the certification election in question.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this was not successfully debunked by petitioner, which chose to focus, albeit erroneously, on the status of the subject&nbsp; employees.<br><br>The exclusion of petitioner’s "supervisors" from the bargaining unit of the rank-and-file employees indiscriminately curtailed the right of these employees to self-organization and representation for purposes of collective bargaining, a right explicitly mandated by our labor laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and "accorded the highest consideration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the recent case of <i>Golden Farms, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> we aptly declared:<br><blockquote>In the case at bench, the evidence established that the monthly paid rank-and-file employees of petitioner primarily perform administrative or clerical work.&nbsp; In contradistinction, the petitioner’s daily paid rank-and-file employees mainly work in the cultivation of bananas in the fields.&nbsp; It is crystal clear the monthly paid rank-and-file employees of petitioner have very little in common with its daily paid rank-and-file employees in terms of duties and obligations, working conditions, salary rates, and skills.&nbsp; <u>To be sure, the said monthly paid rank-and-file employees have even been excluded from the bargaining unit of the daily paid rank-and-file employees.</u>&nbsp; This dissimilarity of interests warrants the formation of a separate and distinct bargaining unit for the monthly paid rank-and-file employees of the petitioner.&nbsp; <u>To rule otherwise would deny this distinct class of employees the right to self-organization for purposes of collective bargaining.&nbsp; Without the shield of an organization, it will also expose them to the exploitations of management.</u>&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.)</blockquote>In the case at bar, BUKLOD cannot successfully act as the bargaining agent of and duly represent petitioner’s "supervisor" employees since the latter were expressly excluded from the appropriate bargaining unit.<br><br>Petitioner’s reliance on the case of <i>Pagkakaisa ng mga Manggagawa sa Triumph Int’l.-United Lumber and General Workers of the Phils. v. Ferrer-Calleja</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> is misplaced.&nbsp; The aforecited case upholds the "one union-one company" policy, thus:<br><blockquote>Once again, we enunciate that the proliferation of unions in an employer unit is discouraged as a matter of policy <u>unless compelling reasons&nbsp; exist which deny a certain and distinct class of employees the right to self-organization for purpose of collective bargaining.</u>&nbsp; (See General Rubber &amp; Footwear Corporation v. Bureau of&nbsp; Labor Relations, 155 SCRA 283 [1987].)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Underscoring ours.)</blockquote>As clearly indicated in the aforequoted decision, the "one union - one company" rule is not without exception.&nbsp; The exclusion of the subject employees from the rank-and-file bargaining unit and the CBA is definitely a "compelling reason" for it completely deprived them of the chance to bargain collectively with petitioner and are thus left with no recourse but to group themselves into a separate and distinct bargaining unit and form their own organization.&nbsp; The rationale behind the exception to the aforementioned policy is further elucidated in <i>Knitjoy Manufacturing, Inc. v. Ferrer-Calleja:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; The suggested bias of the Labor Code in favor of the one company-one union policy, anchored on the greater mutual benefits which the parties could derive, especially in the case of employees whose bargaining strength could undeniably be enhanced by their unity and solidarity but diminished by their disunity, division and dissension, is not without exceptions.<br><br><center>xxx.</center><br>The usual&nbsp; exception, of course, is where the <i>employer</i> unit has to give way to the other units like the craft unit, plant unit, or a subdivision thereof; the recognition of these exceptions takes into account the policy to assure employees of the fullest freedom in exercising their rights.&nbsp; <u>Otherwise stated, the one company-one union policy must yield to the right of the employees to form unions or associations for purposes not contrary to law, to self-organization and to enter into collective bargaining negotiations, among others, which the Constitution guarantees.</u>&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.)</blockquote>The receipt by petitioner’s "supervisor" employees of certain benefits under the CBA between BUKLOD and petitioner is not sufficient to deny the petition for certification election filed by the labor organization formed by the excluded employees.&nbsp; It is not equivalent to and does not compensate for the denial of the right of the excluded employees to self-organization and collective bargaining.&nbsp; We concur with the findings of&nbsp; the Undersecretary of Labor, thus:<br><blockquote>It is not disputed that the members of both petitioning unions NSBPI and NEMPEBPI are excluded from the coverage of the existing CBA entered into between the respondent BPI and Buklod ng mga Manggagawa ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. (BUKLOD) (pp. 84-85, folder II, records).&nbsp; Thus, respondent BPI being privy to the said exclusion has to accept the inescapable consequences of its act of depriving the excluded employees of their right to self-organization for the purpose of collective bargaining.&nbsp; We find immaterial and irrelevant the allegation of hereby respondent BPI to the effect that the benefit being enjoyed by the rank and file employees covered by the existing CBA are extended/accorded to the excluded employees.&nbsp; Indeed, what is crucial and of paramount consideration is the&nbsp; fact&nbsp; that&nbsp; the excluded rank and file employees are&nbsp; afforded the right to bargain collectively.<br><br>The Supreme Court in the cases of <u>General Rubber and Footwear Corporation vs. Bureau of Labor Relations, et al.,</u> G.R. No. 74262, October 29, 1987; and <u>Manila Bay Spinning Mills, J and P Coats, Manila Bay, Inc. vs. Hon. Pura Ferrer-Calleja,</u> G. R. No. 80910, August 1, 1988, ruled that the employees excluded from the coverage of the CBA, <u>who not being excluded by law, have the right to bargain collectively.</u>&nbsp; Further, the Supreme Court aptly stated that:<br><br><u>The allegation that some benefits under the existing CBA were extended to the monthly paid employees, even if true will not preclude them from entering into a CBA of their own.&nbsp; Neither is the inconvenience that may befall petitioner for having to administer two CBAs an excuse for depriving the monthly paid employees of their constitutionally guaranteed&nbsp; right to collective bargaining.</u>&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>The petition for certification election cannot likewise be deterred by the "contract-bar rule,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which&nbsp; finds no application in the present case.&nbsp; The petitioning union NSBPI is not questioning the majority status of Buklod as the incumbent bargaining agent of petitioner’s rank and file employees.&nbsp; The petition for certification election is addressed to a separate bargaining unit--the excluded employees of petitioner.&nbsp; We agree with the ruling of the Undersecretary of Labor, thus:<br><blockquote>Certainly, one who has been instrumental in the denial of a right otherwise enjoyable by a rank and file, as in membership in its appropriate bargaining unit, cannot now say that he ought to be included in the existing bargaining unit of the rank and file just because that "rank and file" employee is now seeking representation for himself as well as those who like him were specifically excluded from the coverage of the CBA.&nbsp; A rank and file employee, irrespective of his job designation and in whatever form his wages are paid has the unbridled right to the exercise of self-organization.&nbsp; This right cannot, like a chattel, be compromised in the bargaining table so as to deprive him of the same in violation of the constitutional mandate.&nbsp; <u>In this wise, the claim as to the applicability of the contract bar doctrine could have not gained ground.&nbsp; A contract bar applies in a situation where the petition is directed towards one and the same bargaining unit.&nbsp; This does not appear to be so in the case considering the built-in-limitation in the CBA excluding the workers sought to be represented by herein petitioner from its coverage, albeit, their being admittedly rank and file employees.</u>&nbsp; On the same line of reasoning, neither would the substantial mutual interest test hold.&nbsp; So too, is the claim against union turncoatism.&nbsp; In the latter case, the emergence thereof is farfetched considering the defined boundaries of the bargaining units concerned.&nbsp; <u>Let it be stressed, that the certification election as ordered would only affect those rank and file employees who are excluded from the coverage of the existing CBA.&nbsp; Those who are already represented in&nbsp; the existing collective bargaining agreement may rest secured in the bargaining unit that considers them as members of its family.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Underscoring ours.)<br></blockquote>The right to self organization and collective bargaining is an integral part of the protection to labor provision embodied in our Constitution, the essence of which is aptly expressed in <i>Tropical Hut Employees’ Union-CGW v. Tropical Hut Food Market, Inc.:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>All employees enjoy the right to self-organization and to form and join labor organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of collective bargaining and&nbsp; to engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection.&nbsp; This is a fundamental right of labor that derives its existence from the Constitution.&nbsp; In interpreting the protection to labor and social justice provisions of the Constitution and the labor laws or rules or regulations, we have always adopted the liberal approach which favors the exercise of labor rights.</blockquote>Finally, we take this opportunity to reiterate the standing rule that a certification election is the sole concern of the workers, hence, an employer lacks the personality to dispute the same.&nbsp; In <i>Golden Farms, Inc. v.&nbsp; Secretary of Labor,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote>Finally, we note that it was petitioner company that filed the motion to dismiss the petition for election.&nbsp; The general rule is that an employer has no standing to question a certification election since this is the sole concern of the workers.&nbsp; Law and policy demand that employers take a strict, hands-off stance in certification elections.&nbsp; The bargaining representative of employees should be chosen free from any extraneous influence of management.&nbsp; A labor bargaining representative, to be effective, must owe its loyalty to the employees alone and to no other.</blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition for certiorari is <b>DISMISSED</b> and the Temporary Restraining Order issued on 8 February 1994 is hereby <b>LIFTED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Padilla, (Chairman), Bellosillo, Vitug, and Hermosisima, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Records, p. 580.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id., at&nbsp;
