				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Right after giving his testimony as the complainant-victim in a frustrated murder case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Mariano Corvera, Sr., a former mayor of Nasipit in Agusan del Norte, was gunned down in cold blood by Pablo Macapas, the accused, inside the courtroom of the Regional Trial Court, Branch II, in Butuan City, then being presided over by Judge Rosarito F. Dabalos.<br><br>In due time,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> a new charge for murder was filed against Macapas, along with his counsel, then Mayor Tranquilino O. Calo, Jr., and the latter’s driver, Belarmino Allocod, in an information (docketed Criminal Case No. 3464) that read:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about morning of March 10, 1988 at Capitol Building, Butuan City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, with treachery and evident premeditation, conspiring, confederating together, and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shot one Mariano Corvera, Sr., with the use of a handgun, hitting the latter on the different parts of the body resulting to his death.<br><br>"That the commission of the crime is attended with the following aggravating circumstances, viz.:<br><br>"1. That it was committed in contempt of or with insult to public authorities; and<br><br>"2. That it was committed in a place where public authorities are engaged in the discharge of their duties.<br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW: (Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>On 08 December 1988, Executive Judge Dabalos ordered the raffle of the case and the issuance of a warrant of arrest, without bail, against Macapas. At the same time, a bail of P50,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was fixed for each of Calo and Allocod.<br><br>Corvera’s son, Mariano Corvera, Jr., assailed before the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 16383) the legality of the grant of bail to Calo and Allocod. On 31 January 1989, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> set aside the questioned order and directed the court <i>a quo</i> to resolve the matter only after conducting the requisite hearing to determine whether or not the evidence of guilt was strong.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 08 February 1989, Executive Judge Dabalos indorsed the case to Judge Jose Adao of Branch 1 of the same court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> stating that he had therefore requested authority from this Court for his inhibition on account of a previous lawyer-client relationship with one of the accused. The following day, Judge Adao, noting that accused Calo and Allocod had voluntarily surrendered themselves, placed the accused in the custody of the Provincial Commander of the Philippine Constabulary at the detention center in Camp Rafael Rodriguez, Libertad, Butuan City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 24 February 1989, Judge Adao, after hearing, fixed bail in the amounts of P100,000.00 and P60,000.00 for the provisional liberty, respectively, of Calo and Allocod.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This Court, however, upon petition of the prosecution in <b>G.R. No. 87194,</b> issued, on 15 March 1989, an order temporarily restraining the lower court from enforcing its order of 24 February 1989 while the case was pending disposition by the Court of Appeals to which the matter was referred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Judge Adao thus directed the recommitment of Calo and Allocod at Camp Rodriquez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 16 May 1989, the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> ultimately dismissed the petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 17142) on the basis of its finding that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in granting bail to Calo and Allocod.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The prosecution and private complainant Mariano Corvera, Jr., thereupon elevated the case to this Court via a petition for <i>certiorari</i> (<b>G.R. No. 88531</b>). On 06 July 1989, the Court ordered the cancellation of the bail in favor of Calo and Allocod and temporarily restrained the Court of Appeals from enforcing its resolution of 16 May 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On 18 June 1990, through a resolution penned by Justice Abdulwahid A. Bidin, the Court granted the petition, set aside the 16th May 1989 decision of the Court of Appeals and made permanent the temporary restraining order it had previously issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the meanwhile, acting on the request of Executive Judge Dabalos in Administrative Matter No. 88-12-3478-RTC for the assignment of Criminal Case No. 3464 to another court, this Court, on 02 February 1989, issued a resolution requiring Judge Zenaida P. Placer to take over the case, The prosecution and complainant Mariano Corvera, Jr., however, later moved for her inhibition on the ground that Calo was the lawyer of Judge Placer’s family. Judge Placer denied the motion on the strength of her having been designated by this Court.<br><br>Once again, the prosecution and Mariano Corvera, Jr., sought this Court’s intervention through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition (<b>G.R. No. 87932</b>). The Solicitor General prayed for the dismissal of the petition, stating that his Office had not authorized anyone to institute it. On 20 July 1989, the Court held that Mariano Corvera, Jr., being the offended party, had sufficient personality and interest to file the special civil action. On the merits of the case, the Court ruled that, considering her past professional relationship with one of the accused and the fact that the case was rather controversial in nature, Judge Placer should be disqualified from hearing it. In her stead, the Court designated Judge Alfredo Lagamon of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City to try the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Finally, on 31 March 1989, Calo and Allocod were arraigned; both pleaded not guilty to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The prosecution gave the following narration of its case.<br><br>Mariano Corvera, Sr., the town Mayor of Nasipit, Agusan del Norte, used to be the vice-president and manager of the Nasipit Integrated Arrastre Stevedoring Services, Inc., ("NIASSI"). He was replaced on 13 June 1986 by Benjamin Jaramillo, who, like Corvera, was a stockholder of the corporation.<br><br>Corvera questioned the election of the corporate officers before the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") which thereupon issued a restraining order. Atty. Tranquilino Calo, Jr., another stockholder, received the order. Calo told Jaramillo that there was no need to be concerned about Corvera’s complaint with the SEC. Later, during the conversation, Calo was heard to have remarked, <u>"Ah,</u> <u>mas</u> <u>maayo</u> <u>pa</u> <u>tingale</u> <u>atong</u> <u>liquidahon</u> <u>si</u> <u>Anoy</u> [Mariano Corvera] <u>kay</u> <u>samokan</u> (Ah, it is better to liquidate Anoy because he is troublesome)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 20 November 1986, which was Jaramillo’s birthday and the 11th anniversary of the founding of NIASSI, the late Mayor Pedrito Carmona of Nasipit and Calo met at Jaramillo’s office. Once again, Calo threatened to liquidate Corvera.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On 06 March 1988, Jaramillo received an injunction order, dated 29 February 1988, from the SEC. The following day, 07 March 1988, Jaramillo went to NIASSI to re-assume his position. In the afternoon, Corvera, together with Engr. Berido, Tiburcio Guno and Col. Esparagoza (retired), went to Jaramillo’ s office to congratulate him. All were taken aback when Calo, with his bodyguards, among them Macapas and Ignacio Albarrigo, banged the door, barged in and shouted at everyone else to get out of the room. Calo pointed his finger at Corvera and shouted, "I will see you dead!"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In the morning of 10 March 1988, during the scheduled trial in Criminal Case No. 2850, Executive Judge Dabalos, Atty. Rosales, Corvera, Calo, court personnel Arturo Cinco and Calixtro Berol, Fiscal Ambrosio Gallarde, and four or five spectators, including Dr. Nelson Obeñita, were in attendance. Stating that Corvera was booked for the ten o’clock, a.m., flight for Cebu, Atty. Rosales moved for the re-setting of the hearing. Calo, counsel for accused Macapas, opposed the motion saying that he himself was scheduled to take the same flight that morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> At about 9:30 a.m., Corvera took the witness stand. Atty. Rosales noticed that while Calo was conducting the cross-examination, he appeared agitated and tense, so much unlike his usual calm way in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>At about ten o’clock, the parties finally agreed to the resetting of the hearing to 22 April 1988. As soon as the judge banged his gavel to adjourn the proceedings, Calo stood up and walked towards the eastern door. Macapas left ahead of Calo but Calo overtook Macapas. Atty. Rosales himself was about to leave when he saw Macapas return to the courtroom holding a revolver and walking in calmly. Then, all of a sudden, he pointed the gun at Corvera. Visibly shaken, Corvera tried to open the western door of the room but it would not budge. Unable to exit, Corvera raised his hands, saying "<u>Ayaw,</u> <u>ayaw,</u> <u>ayaw"</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Don’t, don’t, don’t). Corvera tripped while retreating. He hastily stood up and grabbed a chair to shield himself, still pleading "<u>Ayaw,</u> <u>ayaw."</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Unmoved, Macapas took aim and pressed the trigger. Corvera fell, his hands and feet shaking. Macapas drew closer to Corvera and fired again at his victim. Macapas then turned away as calmly as when he entered the room.<br><br>Atty. Rosales tried to lift Corvera but found him too heavy. Soon four or five other persons came in to help, and they brought Corvera down the building and from there to the hospital. Fiscal Gallarde surfaced from under the lawyers’ table, pale and scared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Fernando Casinao was with the group of Corvera that morning. With them were Raul Abao, Pacifico Larbonita and driver Oligario Barcelona. Corvera, Abao and Larbonita entered the courtroom while Casinao remained at the lobby near the eastern door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Shortly before ten o’clock, Casinao saw security men of Calo in the vicinity of the western door.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He later saw Calo leave the courtroom through the eastern door. A woman who had ascended the eastern stairs conversed with Calo for a few seconds. After the woman had left, Macapas walked towards Calo. Calo handed over a revolver to Macapas. After receiving the firearm, Macapas went back to the courtroom. At that moment, Calo’s security guards were near the stairs while Larbonita was about a foot away to the left of Casinao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Casinao tried to follow Macapas but a person who was standing by the door pushed Casinao back sending him to the railing. Abruptly, there was a burst of gunfire, followed by two more gunshots. Casinao dashed in to the courtroom and, on the way, bumped on Macapas at the eastern door. Casinao saw Corvera lying flat on his back near the western door with his feet towards the podium. Seeing that Corvera was still alive and Atty. Rosales unsuccessfully trying to lift him up, Casinao rushed downstairs and summoned for help to get Corvera fast to the Santos Hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Pacifico Larbonita, a 63-year-old <u>"alalay"</u> of Corvera, left the courtroom at around ten o’clock that morning. He went near the eastern door, squatted a meter away from the door, and smoked. When Calo left the courtroom, Larbonita stood up. Calo remained around two feet away from the eastern door. A lady approached Calo and conversed with him for around five seconds. Just as the lady was departing, Macapas came out of the courtroom and Calo handed a gun over to him. Larbonita was unable to see where Calo got the gun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Macapas went back to the courtroom. Moments later, Larbonita heard a gunshot; then two more gunshots rang out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Dr. Nelson Obeñita, a physician of the Nasipit Lumber Company, was in the courtroom to attend the hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> After the court had adjourned, Dr. Obeñita promptly signed the certificate of attendance and exited through the gallery entrance. Outside the courtroom, he saw Casinao. Dr. Obeñita went down the capitol building through the main entrance. He was in the garden barely twenty meters away when he heard gunshots. He turned to look back; moments later, he saw a man rushing down the stairs of the capitol building. The man proceeded to a vehicle parked by the side of the provincial treasurer’s office. Dr. Obeñita recognized the man to be Macapas. Macapas boarded the vehicle, taking the seat to the right of the driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Maj. Rolando T. Brillantes, then assistant provincial commander for operations of the PC-INP in Agusan del Norte, was in the office of the provincial governor at between 9:00 and 9:30, a.m., of 10 March 1989, to discuss with the governor the laborers’ strike in Nasipit. A commotion outside the building was heard. Then, someone shouted that Mayor Corvera had been shot. Maj. Brillantes went out to the balcony where he saw "the car of Mayor Calo (was) speeding away."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Maj. Evacueto de los Santos, the deputy station commander and operations officer of the Butuan Police Station, learned of the shooting incident from the radio operator. Immediately, he boarded the police car and proceeded to the capitol building with some of his men. There, he was met by PC Major Rolando Brillantes and PC Captain Godofredo de los Santos. While Major de los Santos was being briefed by the two PC officers, the "armored car" of Calo returned to the capitol grounds. Maj. De los Santos directed his men to apprehend the driver and to bring him to the police station. At the police station, the driver, Allocod, denied involvement in the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Sixty seven-year old Corvera sustained three gunshot wounds - one on the right arm which hit and fractured the scapula with the bullet lodged at the trapereus muscle of the back; another on the chest which pierced the skin, costal muscle, blood vessels and right lobe of the lung with the bullet lodged at the sorratus anterior muscle, and the third on the abdomen below the umbilicus piercing the abdominal muscle, the small intestines and the abdominal aorta, subclavia vein, with the bullet lodged at the tissue above the latissimus dorsi muscle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Dr. Elsie Caballero concluded that Corvera died of "shock, internal hemorrhage, (and) multiple gunshot wound(s)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Police authorities were never able to apprehend Macapas.<br><br>In his defense, Calo pictured himself to be incapable of the dastardly act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Although he was removed as a municipal judge for grave misconduct and gross ignorance of the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> he, nevertheless, remained to be a respected practicing lawyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He was an undefeated candidate for mayoralty in Carmen, Agusan del Norte, and for a time headed the "mayors’ league" of the province. He denied having given a gun to Macapas<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> or as having had him as a bodyguard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On 16 March 1990, the trial court promulgated the herein questioned decision disposing of the case, viz:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused TRANQUILINO O. CALO, JR. and BELARMINO ALLOCOD guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code qualified by treachery and with the generic aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, and hereby sentences both accused to suffer the penalty of <u>Reclusion</u> <u>Perpetua.</u><br><br>"On the civil liability, the two accused are hereby jointly and severally sentenced to pay to the heirs of the late Mariano Corvera, Sr. the following:<br><br>"a) P30,000.00 as death compensation;<br><br>"b) P20,000.00 as reimbursement of burial expenses;<br><br>"c) P100,000.00 as reimbursement of litigation expenses and attorney’s fee;<br><br>"d) P800,000.00 representing unrealized net income for eight (8) years;<br><br>"e) P500,000.00 by way of moral damages; and<br><br>"f) P 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote>When their motion for the reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of the decision was denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Calo and Allocod, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of his appeal, Calo died of myocardial infraction secondary to coronary insufficiency at the New Bilid Prisons Hospital in Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, per the certificate of postmortem examination issued by the National Bureau of Investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Pursuant to the ruling in <i>People vs. Bayotas,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the instant appeal should thus be confined only to Allocod’s case.<br><br>Appellant Allocod evidently was linked to the commission of the crime for being then the driver of Calo. The only evidence that could provide some indication on his possible involvement in the story of the prosecution would be a portion of the testimony of Dr. Obeñita, as well as that of Maj. Brillantes, in connection with the declaration of Dr. Obeñita.

In fact, according to Maj.

V. Briefly, the prosecution charged that at around 6:30 in the evening of 01 April 1985, Corvera was driving a jeep with Estelito Tecson, Jr., his passenger, on the way home to Nasipit from Kinabhangan. Along the highway, three persons, one of whom was Pablo Macapas, hailed the vehicle and asked for a ride. Just as Corvera was slowing down, Macapas pointed a gun at Tecson who, upon seeing what was about to happen, parried the hand of Macapas. The gun exploded and a bullet hit the right parietal region of Corvera’s head.
