That plaintiff which has a distinct and separate personality of its own under the law, and was never a party to the case between DAVENCOR and MLE, suddenly became a party to the case after the decision became final and executory with the issuance of Annex "B" hereof for reasons known to the defendants alone:<br><br>6. That the issuance of Annex ‘B’ hereof (the order of execution) by the defendant Minister has been made not only without or in excess of his authority but that the same was issued patently without any factual or legal basis, hence, a gross violation of plaintiff’s constitutional rights under the due process clause;<br><br>7. That plaintiff, in the face of the order (Annex ‘B’) complained of, there being no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, does not have any alternative but to ventilate the present recourse;<br><br>8. That defendant Minister is doing, threatens or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act which definitely is in violation of the plaintiff’s rights respecting the subject matter of the action, and unless said act or acts are restrained or prohibited at least during the pendency of this case, said act or acts would probably work not only injustice to plaintiff but world tend to render the judgment of this Honorable court ineffectual;<br><br>9. That the commission or continuance of the acts complained of during the present litigation would not only cause great and irreparable injury, but will also work injustice to the plaintiff, and would complicate, aggravate and multiply the issues in this case;<br><br>10. That the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consist in restraining the commission or continuance of the acts complained of, or in the performance of acts, either for a limited period or perpetually;<br><br>11. That great and irreparable injury would inevitably result to the plaintiff before the matter can be heard on notice, hence, immediate issuance of a restraining order is necessary and proper;<br><br>12. That the plaintiff is willing and able to file the necessary bond executed to the defendants, in an amount to be fixed by the Court, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay to the defendants all damages which they may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court should finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto."</blockquote>MIWPI, likewise alleges that in wantonly and imprudently procuring the Writ of Execution against it, which DAVENCOR and Philip Co seek to enforce a 2.5 Million Peso liability of plaintiff, the latter has been constrained to bring the present action, thereby incurring damages in the sum of P500,000.00 in concept of actual and compensatory damages, and P250,000.00 in attorney’s fees, which amount petitioner now seeks to recover.<br><br>The trial court issued a temporary restraining order the next day, February 12, 1987, restraining and/or enjoining the private respondents and the Hon. Secretary of Natural Resources from enforcing, implementing and/or carrying into effect, the decision of the respondent Secretary dated October 1, 1986, as well as the order of execution dated January 6, 1987.<br><br>On February 17, 1987, private respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> alleging that the trial court had no jurisdiction over the case under Presidential Decree No. 705, to which Motion to Dismiss, petitioner filed an Opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated February 1987.&nbsp; On March 9, 1987, the trial court issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> denying private respondent’s Motion to Dismiss.&nbsp; Hence, private respondents filed their Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated March 13, 1987 and an Amended Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the latter pleading, private respondents raised the following special and affirmative defenses:<br><blockquote>"7. That neither Milagros Matuguina nor Matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc. advised defendant Davencor of the change of name, and transfer of management of PTL No. 30. From Milagros Matuguina to Matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc., during the pendency of MNR Case No. 6540 before the Bureau of Forest Develoment and the Ministry of Natural Resources, notwithstanding that the lawyer of matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc., who was also a stockholder thereof, had appeared for Milagros Matuguina in said administrative case.<br><br>8. That plaintiff has acted in bad faith and is now in estoppel from questioning the Writ of Execution issued against Milagros Matuguina (now Matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc.) to satisfy the judgment in MNR Case No. 6540.<br><br>9. This Honorable Court has no jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of this action, especially because:<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff has not exhausted administrative remedies available to it before initiating this action;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the guise of entertaining an action for damages, this Court is being misled by the plaintiff into deciding questions properly for the Department of Natural Resources to decide exclusively in the lawful exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction;<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff is now precluded and estopped from filing this action.<br><br>10. The plaintiff has no cause of action against the defendants and has not stated any in its complaint, especially because:<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having failed to exhaust administrative remedies, plaintiff is without a ripe cause of action that can be pleaded before this Honorable Court;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In substance, there is no justifiable question raised under the facts and circumstances of this case.</blockquote>Meanwhile, on June 2, 1987, the trial court issued an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> granting the petitioner’s prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction against the private respondents and the Secretary of Natural Resources, ordering them to desist, refrain and prevent from enforcing respondent Secretary’s Decision dated October 1, 1986 as well as the writ of execution dated January 8, 1987.<br><br>On May 10, 1989, the trial court rendered its Decison<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> in favor of the petitioner, disposing of the action as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, finding the evidence of plaintiff, Matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc. sufficient to sustain a preponderance of evidence, showing that the order of execution dated January 6, 1987, issued by the Minister of Natural Resources, through Alexander C.

No. L-15121, August 31, 1963, 5 SCRA 1011), or a corporation and its successor-in-interest shall be considered as one and the liability of the former attach to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>But for the separate juridical personality of a corporation to be disregarded, the wrongdoing must be clearly and convincingly established.&nbsp; It cannot be presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, there is, insufficient basis for the appellate court’s ruling that MIWPI is the same as Matuguina.&nbsp; The trial court’s observation is enlightening.<br><blockquote>"Despite apparently opposing evidence of both parties, the Court gathered and finds, that defendant’s attempt to pierce the veil of corporate personality of plaintiff corporation, as to consider plaintiff corporations merely an adjunct or alter ego of Maria Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprises, to justify defendants claim against plaintiff corporation, suffers heavily from insufficiency of evidence.<br><br>It is the vehement contention of defendants, to bolster its claim, that plaintiff corporation is the alter ego of Maria Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprises, because when Milagros Matuguina became the Chairman of the Board of Directors of plaintiff corporation, she requested for the change of name and transfer of management of PTL No. 30, from her single proprietorship, to plaintiff corporation.<br><br>Secondly, when Milagros Matuguina executed the deed of transfer, transferring her forest concession under PTL No, 30, together with all the structures and improvements therein, to plaintiff corporation, for a consideration of P14,800.00 representing 148,000 shares of stocks of plaintiff corporation actually all existing shares of stocks of Milagros Matuguina, in plaintiff corporation represents 77.4% therein; suffice to say that plaintiff corporation practically became an alter ego of Milagros Matuguina.<br><br>Defendants’ arguments on this peripheral aspect of corporate existence, do not at all indicate that such a legal fiction, was granted.<br><br>In the first place the alleged control of plaintiff corporation was not evident in any particular corporate acts of plaintiff corporation, wherein Maria Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprises using plaintiff corporation, executed acts or powers directly involving plaintiff corporation.<br><br>Neither was there any evidence of defendants, that Maria Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprises, using the facilities and resources of plaintiff corporation, involved itself in transaction using both single proprietorship and plaintiff corporation in such particular line of business undertakings.<br><br>As stated by this court in resolving plaintiff’s prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, said:<br><br>‘There is actually, no evidence presented by defendant, showing that sometime on March 15, 1986, to January 1987, during which period, the subject decision of Hon. Secretary of Natural Resources and corresponding writ of execution, Maria Milagros Matuguina was a stockholder of plaintiff corporation in such amount or was she an officer of plaintiff corporation in whatever capacity.’<br><br>The above circumstances is relevant and significant to assume any such justification of including plaintiff corporation in the subject writ of execution, otherwise as maintained by defendants, what matters most was the control of Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprises of plaintiff corporation in 1974 and 1975, when the administrative case was pending, this circumstance alone without formally including plaintiff corporation in said case, will not create any valid and sufficient justification for plaintiff corporation, to have been supposedly included in the suit against defendants and Maria Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprises, in the administrative case.<br><br>Yet, granting as claimed by defendants, that in 1974 or in 1975, Maria Milagros Matuguina became the controlling stockholder of plaintiff corporation, on account of the change of name and transfer of management of PTL No. 30, this circumstance, we repeat, does not of itself prove that plaintiff corporation was the alter ego of Maria Milagros Matuguina Logging Enterprise, as enunciated in various decisions of this Court, to wit:<br><br>‘It is important to bear in mind that mere ownership by a single stockholder or by another corporation of all or nearly all of the capital stocks of the corporation, is not itself a sufficient warrant for disregarding the fiction of separate personality.&nbsp; (Liddel and Co. vs. Collector of Internal revenue, G.R. No. 9687, June 30, 1961).’<br><br>It is recognized as lawful to obtain a corporation charter, even with a single substantial stockholder, to engage in specific activity and such activity may co-exist with other private activities of the stockholders.<br><br>If the corporation is substantial one, conducted lawfully; without fraud on another, its separate identity is to be respected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>In this jurisdiction, it is a settled rule that conclusions and findings of fact by trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent reasons because the trial court is in a better position to examine real evidence, as well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying in the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>It is likewise improper to state that the MIWPI is the privy or the successor-in-interest of MLE, as the liability for the encroachment over DAVENCOR’s timber concession is concerned, by reason of the transfer of interest in PTL No. 30 from MLE to MIWPI.<br><br>First at all, it does not appear indubitable that the said transfer ever became effective, since PTL No. 30 remained in the name of Milagros Matuguina/MLE until it expired on June 30, 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>More importantly, even if it is deemed that there was a valid change of name and transfer of interest in the PTL No. 30, this only signifies a transfer of authority, from MLE to MIWPI, to conduct logging operations in the area covered by PTL No. 30.&nbsp; It does not show indubitable proof that MIWPI was a mere&nbsp; conduit or successor of Milagros Matuguina/MLE, as far the latter’s liability for the encroachment upon DAVENCOR’s concession is concerned.&nbsp; This is the only conclusion which we can discern from the language of Section 61 of P.D. 705,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and the letters of the Acting Minister of Natural Resources to Milagros Matuguina/MLE and to MIWPI, on September 16, 1975.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In Soriano vs. Court of Appeals, this Court stated in clear language, that-<br><blockquote>"It is the general rule that the protective mantle of a corporation’s separate and distinct personality could only be pierced and liability attached directly to its officers and/or members - stockholders, when the same is used for fraudulent, unfair, or illegal purpose.&nbsp; In the case at bar, there is no showing that the Association entered into the transaction with the private respondent for the purpose of defrauding the latter of his goods or the payment thereof.&nbsp; xxx.&nbsp; Therefore, the general rule on corporate liability, not the exception, should be applied in resolving this case.&nbsp; (G.R. No. 49834, June 22, 1989)</blockquote>The respondents cite Section 61 of P.D. 705 to establish MIWPI’s succession to the liability of Milagros Matuguina/MLE:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 61.&nbsp; <i>Transfer.</i>&nbsp; "Unless authorized by the Department Head, no licensee, lessee, or permittee may transfer, exchange, sell, or convey his license agreement, license, lease or permit, or any of his rights or interest therein, or any of his assets used in connection therewith.<br><br>The licensee, lessee, or permittee shall be allowed to transfer or convey his license agreement, license, lease, or permit only if he has not violated any forestry law, rule or regulation; has been faithfully complying with the terms and conditions of the license agreement, license, lease or permit; the transferee has all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to hold a license agreement, license, lease or permit; there is no evidence that such transfer or conveyance is being made for purposes of speculation; and the transferee shall assume all the obligations of the transferor.<br><br>The transferor shall forever be barred from acquiring another license agreement, license, lease or permit."</blockquote>Even if it is mandated in the abovestated provision that "the transferee shall assume all the obligations of the transferor" this does not mean that all obligations are assumed, indiscriminately.<br><br>Invariably, it is not the letter, but the spirit of the law and intent of the legislature that is important.&nbsp; When the interpretation of a statute according to the exact and literal import of its words would lead to absurdity, it should be construed according to the spirit and reason, disregarding if necessary the letter of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In construing statutes, the terms used therein are generally to be given their ordinary meaning, that is, such meaning which is ascribed to them when they are commonly used, to the end that absurdity in the law must be avoided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The term "obligations" as used in the final clause of the second paragraph of Section 61 of P.D. 705 is construed to mean those obligations incurred by the transferor in the ordinary course of business.&nbsp; It cannot be construed to mean those obligations or liabilities incurred by the transferor as a result of transgressions of the law, as these are personal obligations of the transferor, and could not have been included in the term "obligations" absent any modifying provision to that effect.<br><br>In the September 16, 1975 letters of Acting Director of the Bureau of Forest Development to Milagros Matuguina and MIWPI informing them of the approval of Matuguina's request for the change of name and transfer of management of PTL No. 30, the following statements were made by the Acting Director:<br><br>"In view hereof, (Matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc.) shall assume the responsibility of paying whatever pending liabilities and/or accounts remaining unsettled, if any, by the former licensee, Milagros Matuguina, with the government."&nbsp; (Emphasis ours)[47]<br><br>Accordingly, the letter's language implies that the obligations which MIWPI are to assume as transferee of Milagros Matuguina/MLE are those obligations in favor of the government only, and not to any other entity.&nbsp; Thus this would include Forestry Charges, Taxes, Fees, and similar accountabilities.<br><br>In sum, the Court makes the following pronouncements:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; The respondent Honorable Minister of Natural Resources gravely abuse its discretion when it issued its Order of Execution on January 6, 1987, including therein as one of the parties liable the petitioner Matuguina Integrated Wood Products, Inc., which was never a party to the assailed proceeding resulting in the issuance of such Order and, without affording the same an opportunity to be heard before it was adjudged liable.<br><br>(b)&nbsp; The petitioner is a corporate entity separate and distinct from Milagros Matuguina/Matuguina Logging Enterprises, there being no clear basis for considering it as a mere conduit or alter ego of Matuguina/MLE, and therefore, cannot be made liable for the obligations of the same for encroachment over the timber concession of private respondent DAVENCOR.<br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED,</b> and the Decision dated February 25, 1991 is <b>SET ASIDE.</b>&nbsp; The decision of the Regional Trial Court is hereby <b>REINSTATED,</b> and correspondingly, Order of Execution of the respondent Secretary of Natural Resources is declared <b>Null and Void</b> and without effect.<br><br>No pronouncement as to cost.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Regalado (Chairman), Romero, Puno, and Mendoza, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Articles of Incorporation of MIWPI are on p. 232 of Rollo.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, p. 222.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Ibid., p. 227.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Ibid., p. 228.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Ibid., p. 250.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Infra.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Rollo, p. 194.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Ibid., p. 172.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Ibid., 188.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Ibid., 93.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Ibid., 191.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Ibid., p. 77.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Ibid., p. 102.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Ibid., p. 106.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Ibid., p. 109.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Ibid., p. 117.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Ibid., p. 159.17 dated July 16, 1987<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Ibid, p. 122.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Ibid., p. 309.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp;
