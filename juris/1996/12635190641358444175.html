				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court with application for a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction is the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 10 March 1995 dismissing the petition for certiorari and prohibition filed by petitioner.&nbsp; Impugned likewise is the resolution of the Court of Appeals dated 13 July 1995 denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The present controversy arose from the following facts:<br><br>Petitioner Fil-Estate Golf &amp; Development, Inc. (FEGDI) is the developer of the Manila Southwoods golf course and residential subdivision project which partly covers lands located in Binan, Laguna.&nbsp; Its partner in the joint venture, La Paz Housing and Development Corporation (La Paz), provided the aforementioned properties which are registered in its name.&nbsp; The project involves the "construction and development of, among others, a highway interchange linking nearby communities to the South Expressway and world class tourism-generating cultural theme and water parks."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On 29 December 1992, a certain Felipe Layos filed a complaint for Injunction and Damages with Application for Preliminary Injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against Fil-Estate Realty Corporation, (FERC) et al. With the Regional Trial Court of Binan, Laguna and docketed as Civil Case No. B-3973.<br><br>It was alleged in the said complaint that Felipe Layos is the legal owner and possessor of two (2) parcels of land having a total area of 837,695 square meters located at Barrio Tubigan, Binan, Laguna, known as Lots 1 &amp; 2 of Plan Psu-201 of the Bureau of Lands having acquired the same from his father, Mauricio Layos, who in turn inherited said properties from his own father, Natalio Layos, allegedly the original owner thereof.&nbsp; Layos claimed that the Southwoods project encroached upon the aforecited lands and thus contended that his rights of ownership and possession were violated when FERC brought in men and equipment to begin development of the said properties.<br><br>On 2 February 1993, FERC filed an Opposition to Application for Writ of Preliminary Injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and explicitly stated therein that the developer of the Southwoods project is its sister company, FEGDI.<br><br>On 5 March 1993, FEGDI filed an Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to the abovementioned complaint and reiterated that it is the developer of the Southwoods project and not FERC and that the land covered by the project is covered by Transfer Certificates of Title in the name of La Paz, copies of which were attached to said answer as annexes.<br><br>On 29 March 1993, Presiding Judge Justo M. Sultan of the Regional Trial Court of Binan, Laguna issued an order denying the prayer for preliminary injunction in Civil Case No. B-3973 in view of the inability of Layos to substantiate his right.&nbsp; Neither he nor his counsel appeared on the scheduled hearings.&nbsp; The order reads as follows:<br><blockquote><center>xxx.</center><br>When this case was called for hearing on the petition for issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction, only the defendant Fil-Estate Realty Corp. and its counsel are present.&nbsp; On the other hand, the plaintiff and counsels did not appear in Court.<br><br>Records will show that on January 18, 1993, a temporary restraining order was issued by the Court and was served on the defendant on February 1, 1993.&nbsp; On the February 2, 1993 hearing, the plaintiff moved that the hearing be reset on February 22, 1993.&nbsp; This is with the full knowledge that a temporary restraining order would become moot and academic by the next hearing.<br><br>On the date of the hearing (February 27, 1993), the plaintiff moved for postponement on the ground that he will submit a report on the relocation survey within Ten (10) days; hence, the hearing was again reset to March 23, 1993.&nbsp; That, on said date (March 23, 1993), no hearing took place inasmuch as the plaintiff just filed a written Motion for Postponement.&nbsp; The Court then set the hearing to March 30, 1993.&nbsp; Again, the hearing was reset to April 29, 1993.&nbsp; LRC Case No. B-452 (sic) being related to Civil Case No. B-3973, its hearing was likewise made to coincide with the hearing on the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction.&nbsp; On the date set for hearing, the plaintiff who is also the applicant in LRC Case No. B-542 including his two counsels did not appear in Court despite due notice to them.<br><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the plaintiff’s inability to substantiate his right, the prayer for preliminary injunction is denied due course.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>On 25 June 1993, Felipe Layos along with his wife and other individuals filed another case for Injunction and Damages with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction with the Regional Trial Court of San Pedro, Laguna docketed as Civil Case No. B-4133, this time against the correct party, FEGDI.<br><br>The complaint in the San Pedro case (Civil Case No. B-4133) is basically identical to that filed in the Binan case (Civil Case No. B-3973), except for changes in the number of party-plaintiffs and party-defendants and in the area size of the claimed landholdings.&nbsp; Further, in the San Pedro case there is reference to a title (OCT No. 239), a specific date of intrusion and an increase in the damages prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 1 July 1993, FEGDI moved to dismiss the San Pedro case on grounds of <i>Litis pendentia,</i> forum-shopping, lack of cause of action and lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> FEGDI argued that a similar complaint was previously filed with the Regional Trial Court of Binan, Laguna and is currently pending therein.&nbsp; It, likewise, accused the private respondents of forum-shopping, stating that the latter instituted the San Pedro case after their application for preliminary injunction was denied by the Binan court.&nbsp; Anent the third and fourth grounds, FEGDI averred that the documents relied upon by the private respondents are of doubtful veracity and that they failed to pay the correct filing fees considering that the San Pedro case is a real action as allegedly revealed in the body of the complaint.&nbsp; The Layoses filed their opposition on 5 July 1993 arguing in the main that there is no <i>litis pendentia</i> because there is no identity of parties.&nbsp; Felipe Layos claimed that he never authorized the filing of the Binan case and that the defendant therein is the Fil-Estate Realty Corporation not the Fil-Estate Golf &amp; Development, Inc.&nbsp; Consequently, the two cases being dissimilar, there can be no forum-shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Private respondents contended, likewise, that they have satisfied all the requirements of a valid cause of action and insisted that the suit is not for recovery of possession but is a personal action for injunction and damages.&nbsp; On 12 July 1993, Judge Stella Cabuco-Andres of the San Pedro Regional Trial Court issued an order denying FEGDI’s motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Motion for Reconsideration filed by FEGDI on 13 July 1993 was similarly denied by the aforesaid court in an order dated 14 July 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 15 July 1993, FEGDI filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with Application for Preliminary Injunction with the Court of Appeals (docketed as CA-G.R. Sp No. 31507)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> assailing the denial of its motion to dismiss the San Pedro case.&nbsp; The arguments and issues raised by petitioner to support its motion to dismiss were the same issues raised in the aforestated petition.<br><br>On 20 July 1993, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Judge Andres from proceeding with the San Pedro case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the Regional Trial Court of Binan, Laguna, in an order dated 25 January 1994, dismissed the Binan case without prejudice on grounds of forum-shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> FEGDI moved for a partial reconsideration of the said order praying that the dismissal be with prejudice.&nbsp; Hence, on 25 April 1994, the aforestated court dismissed the Binan case with prejudice to forestall the plaintiffs therein from forum-shopping.&nbsp; The said order states, thus:<br><blockquote><center>xxx.</center><br>This Court in its Order dated January 25, 1994 dismissed the case on the ground of forum shopping.&nbsp; The defendant corporation later on filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration insisting that the dismissal should be permanent as a penalty for forum shopping.&nbsp; For indeed, the reiteration of the same would result in contempt, summary dismissal of all the actions or proceedings as well as administrative sanctions.&nbsp; (MP[sic] Finance Corp. vs. Abesamis, 195 SCRA 592; (Benguel [sic] Electric Corp., Inc. vs. AEA, Jan 23, 1991; see also Aqualyn Corp. vs. CA, 214 SCRA 307 (1992); Ruiz vs. Drilon, 209 SCRA 695 (1992).<br><br>This Court is in full agreement with the defendant corporation, otherwise, if the dismissal is without prejudice, what would prevent the plaintiff from raising the same thing in another tribunal as it has raised in Branch 31 of this Court?&nbsp; It would result in absurdity.&nbsp; The rule prohibiting as well as penalizing forum-shopping has not been intended to allow absurdity to happen.&nbsp; It was intended to prevent repetitious filing of suits by one party in case he cannot succeed in a claim lodged before a court of justice.&nbsp; There must be an end to litigation and this is one thing the penalty for forum shopping has intended to be.<br><br>Wherefore, in view of the foregoing premises, the Motion for Reconsideration is granted.&nbsp; This case is hereby dismissed with prejudice.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>On 10 March 1995, the Court of Appeals dismissed FEGDI’s petition for lack of merit.&nbsp; It ruled that:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; There is no <i>litis pendentia</i> because there is no identity of parties, specifically the main party-defendants, FERC (the defendant in the Binan case) and FEGDI (the defendant in the San Pedro case) which have separate and distinct personalities;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Private respondents are not guilty of forum-shopping for the same reason as above-stated;<br><br>3.&nbsp; The essential elements of a valid cause of action are present in private respondents’ complaint and the main allegations therein are sufficient for the court to render a valid judgment; and<br><br>4.&nbsp; Private respondents paid the correct filing fees.&nbsp; Not being a real action, there was no need for private respondents to state in their complaint the assessed value of the properties in question as basis for the assessment and collection of the docket and filing fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>FEGDI’s motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied in the Court of Appeals’ resolution dated 13 July 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Hence, this petition for review.<br><br>Petitioner makes the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS (AND RESPONDENT JUDGE) ERRED IN FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THAT CIVIL CASE NO.

(par. 2).<br><br>Said lots have a total area of 837,695 square meters as shown in said plan.&nbsp; The original owner and lawful possessor of said land is NATALIO LAYOS, grandfather of herein plaintiff (par. 3).<br><br>When his said grandfather died, said properties were acquired by inheritance by his sole heir MAURICIO LAYOS, who is the father of herein plaintiff. (par. 4).<br><br>On April 15, 1992, said MAURICIO LAYOS executed an "Affidavit of Self-Adjudication with Sale," copy of which is attached as Annex "B" hereof, whereby said Mauricio Layos after having adjudicated the subject properties to himself as sole heir of the deceased Natalio Layos, sold the same properties to herein plaintiff Felipe Layos. (par. 5).<br><br>Plaintiff herein is now the owner and lawful possessor of the subject properties, his possession thereof, tucking (sic) the possession of his said father and grandfather, in the concept of an owner, is for more than thirty (30) years, way back in 1909 when the said plan was approved by the Bureau of Lands. (par. 6).<br><br>The subject parcels of land is (sic) declared for taxation purposes as evidenced by Tax Declarations Nos. 55007 and 55008, copy of each attached as Annexes "C" and "D" hereof, respectively (par. 7).<br><br>Recently, said defendants, in conspiracy and in confederation with one another, have brought men, materials, and equipments (sic) near the subject properties and are threatening, procuring, suffering, or about to, enter, occupy, use and/or develop the subject properties in gross violation of the plaintiff’s rights of ownership and possession over said properties (par. 8).<br><br>Such acts of defendants are in violation of plaintiff’s rights as lawful owner and possessor of subject properties, and the same would work great and irreparable damage and injustice to plaintiff.

(par. 10)<br><br>The commission or continuance of the acts complained of during the litigation would definitely work great and irreparable injustice and damage to plaintiff, and may render the judgment that his Honorable Court may render (sic) ineffective. (par. 11).<br><br>Unless immediately restrained, defendants and persons working under them will persist and continue entering, occupying, use (sic) and/or developing the subject properties of plaintiff in violation of the latter’s right and to his great damage and irreparable injuries. (sic; par. 12).<br><br>Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or other sufficient remedy in the ordinary course of law, and he is willing to file an injunction bond in such amount that the Honorable Court may reasonably fix. (par. 13).<br><br>Due to the abovesaid unlawful acts of defendants, plaintiff has suffered fear, anxiety, worry, embarrasment, nervous tension, and other similar injuries for which he is entitled to an award of moral damages in the amount of not less than P100,000.00. (par. 14).<br><br>For the same reason, and to serve as an example for the public good, plaintiff is entitled to an award of moral (sic) damages which can be reasonably estimated at not less than P100,000.00 (par. 15).<br><br>For the same reason, and to protect the rights and interest (sic), plaintiff is constrained to engage the services of counsel for which it has committed to pay the sum of P100,000.00 plus P1,000.00 per court appearance of counsel. (par. 16)<br><br>At the outset, a restraining order be issued directing defendants, their officers, workers, attorneys, agents, representatives, subordinates, personnel and other persons assisting them or acting under them, to desist and refrain from entering, occupying, using or developing the properties subject of this case, particularly Lots 1 and 2 of Plan Psu-201, copy attached as Annex "A" hereof. (Prayer 1).<br><br>Thereafter, a preliminary injunction be issued after plaintiff’s filing of an injunction bond in such amount as this Honorable Court may reasonably fix.

Affidavit).<br><br>I am the owner and lawful possessor of two (2) parcels of land situated at Barrio Tubigan, Binan, Laguna, known as Lots 1and 2 of Plan Psu-201 of the Bureau of Lands and covered by OCT No. 239 copies of which are marked as Annexes "A" and "B" of the Complaint, respectively.&nbsp; (par. 1, Affidavit).<br><br>Said Lots have a total area of 1,068,725 square meters as shown in said plan and OCT.&nbsp; The original owner and lawful possessor of said land is NATALIO LAYOS, my grandfather.&nbsp; (par. 2, Affidavit).<br><br>When my said grandfather died, said properties were acquired by inheritance by his sole heir MAURICIO LAYOS who is my father.&nbsp; (par. 3, Affidavit).<br><br>On April 15, 1992, my said father, MAURICIO LAYOS, executed an "Affidavit of Self-Adjudication with Sale", copy of which is attached as Annex "C" of the Complaint, whereby said Mauricio Layos, after having adjudicated the subject properties to himself as sole heir of the deceased Natalio Layos, sold the same properties to me.&nbsp; (par. 4, Affidavit).<br><br>By virtue thereof, I am now the owner and lawful possessor of the said properties.&nbsp; My possession thereof, tucking [sic] the possession of my said father and grandfather, in the concept of an owner, is for more than thirty (30) years, even before December 14, 1909 when the said plan was approved by the Bureau of Lands.&nbsp;

(par. 10, Affidavit).<br><br>The commission or continuance of the acts complained of during the litigation of the instant case would definitely work great and irreparable injury and damage to plaintiffs, and may make the judgment that this Honorable Court may render herein ineffectual.&nbsp;

It cannot be denied that private respondents were aware of the Binan case considering that Annex C (Affidavit of Self-Adjudication with Sale) of the San Pedro complaint was a mere photocopy of Annex B of the Binan complaint.<br><br>Private respondents likewise aver that there is no identity of party-defendants in view of the fact that the defendant in the Binan case is the Fil-Estate Realty Corporation (FERC) and in the San Pedro case the Fil-Estate Golf and Development, Inc.

Thus, said Paragraph 17 provides that no petition may be filed in the then Intermediate Appellate Court, now the Court of Appeals "if another similar petition has been filed or is still pending in the Supreme Court" and vice-versa.&nbsp; The Rule ordains that "(a) violation of the rule shall constitute a contempt of court and shall be a cause for the summary dismissal of both petitions, without prejudice to the taking of appropriate action against the counsel or party concerned."<br><br>This rule has been equally applied in the recent case of Limpin, Jr., et al. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al., where the party having filed an action in one branch of the regional trial court shops for the same remedies of a restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction in another branch of the same court.&nbsp;

Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> we held as follows:<br><blockquote>A cause of action is the fact or combination of facts which affords a party a right to judicial interference in his behalf.&nbsp; The requisites for a cause of action are:&nbsp; (a) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created, (b) an obligation on the part of the defendant to respect and not to violate such right; and (c) an act or omission on the part of the defendant constituting a violation of the plaintiff’s right or breach of the obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff.&nbsp; Briefly stated, it is the reason why the litigation has come about; it is the act or omission of defendant resulting in the violation of someone’s right.<br><br>In determining the existence of a cause of action, only the statements in the complaint may properly be considered.&nbsp; Lack of cause of action must appear on the face of the complaint and its existence may be determined only by the allegations of the complaint, consideration of other facts being proscribed and any attempt to prove extraneous circumstances not being allowed.<br><br>If a defendant moves to dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of cause of action, such as what petitioners did in the case at bar, he is regarded as having hypothetically admitted all the averments thereof.&nbsp; The test of sufficiency of the facts found in a complaint as constituting a cause of action is whether or not admitting the facts alleged the court can render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the prayer thereof.&nbsp; The hypothetical admission extends to the relevant and material facts well pleaded in the complaint and inferences fairly deducible therefrom.&nbsp; Hence, if the allegations in the complaint furnish sufficient basis by which the complaint can be maintained, the same should not be dismissed regardless of the defense that may be assessed by the defendants.</blockquote>However, the Court of Appeals, as well as the trial court, limited itself to the allegations in the complaint proper of the San Pedro case in concluding that said complaint stated a cause of action.&nbsp; This is erroneous.&nbsp; In the determination of whether or not the complaint states a cause of action, the annexes attached to the complaint may be considered, they being parts of the complaint:<br><blockquote>The fact that there is "no cause of action" must be evident on the face of the complaint itself (namely, the allegations, including attached annexes and statements, mentioned in the complaint (Acuna v. Batac Producers Cooperative, L-20333, June 30, 1967; Deleplanque v. Teruel, et al., 95 Phil. 959).&nbsp; In other words, the test is "assuming the allegations and statements to be true, does the plaintiff have a valid cause of action?&nbsp; If the answer is NO, dismissal on this ground will be proper (See World Wide Insurance and Surety Co. v. Manuel, 18 Phil. 46).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <br><br>Particularly, in <i>Deleplanque v. Teruel,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> we ruled that:<br><br>xxx. It is contended for the appellant that the lower court erred in taking into account civil case No. Q-232 of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City, already above referred to, because it is a foreign matter and the rule is that a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack of cause of action must be based only on the allegations appearing in the complaint.&nbsp; The rule invoked by counsel for the appellant is correct, but it has no application to the case at bar.&nbsp; It appears that, aside from the fact that in paragraph VII of the complaint the sale of the land belonging to the defendant J.B. Teruel was expressly mentioned as having been made at a ‘public auction’, the said complaint contains, as Annex ‘B’, a copy of the sheriff’s certificate of sale in civil case No. Q-232, whereby the land in question was conveyed to the herein defendant Manuela C. Perez cor (sic) P22, 656.00, pursuant to a writ of execution dated February 12, 1952, issued by the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City, Branch III. xxx.</blockquote>In the case at bar, Annex C of the complaint, which is the "Affidavit of Self-Adjudication" glaringly negates the existence of a cause of action as will be discussed hereinafter.<br><br>Moreover, the rule that the court’s scrutiny is limited to the four corners of the complaint is subject to exceptions as laid down in <i>Marcopper Mining Corporation v.

Director of Forestry,</i> (supra), we ruled:<br><br>"In Llanto v. Ali Dimaporo, et al. (16 SCRA 601, March 31, 1966), this Court, thru Justice Conrado V. Sanchez, held that the trial court can properly dismiss a complaint on a motion to dismiss due to lack of cause of action even without a hearing, by taking into consideration the discussion in said motion and the opposition thereto. xxx.<br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx.</center><br>"Furthermore, 'even if the complaint stated a valid cause of action, a motion to dismiss for insufficiency of cause of action will be granted if documentary evidence admitted by stipulation disclosing facts sufficient to defeat the claim enabled the court to go beyond disclosure in the complaint' (LOCALS No. 1470, No. 1469, and No. 1512 of the International Longshoreman's Association v. Southern Pacific Co., 6 Fed. Rules Service, p. 107, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, Dec. 7, 1952; 131 F. 2d. 605). xxx.<br><br>"Moreover, petitioner-appellant cannot invoke the rule that, when the ground for asking dismissal is that the complaint states no cause of action, its sufficiency must be determined only from the allegations in the complaint.&nbsp; 'The rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure substantial justice.&nbsp; If a technical and rigid enforcement of the rules is made, their aim would be defeated.&nbsp; Where the rules are merely secondary in importance are made to override the ends of justice; the technical rules had been misapplied to the prejudice of the substantial right of a party, said rigid application cannot be countenanced.'&nbsp; (Vol. 1, Francisco, Civil Procedure, 2 ed., 1973, p. 157, citing cases.)"<br><br>The trial court, therefore, did not err in considering, in addition to the complaint, other pleadings submitted by the parties in deciding whether or not the complaint should be dismissed for lack of a cause of action.</blockquote>Commenting on the exception as expounded in the above-cited case, Justice Florenz D. Regalado, an eminent authority on Remedial Law has this to say:<br><blockquote>xxx. The exception is provided in Sec. 2, Rule 9, i.e., where the motion to dismiss on this ground in (sic) filed during the trial in which case the evidence presented is considered.&nbsp; Also, it has been held that under this ground the trial court can consider all the pleadings filed, including annexes, motions and the evidence on record (<i>Marcopper Mining Corp. vs. Garcia, G.R.
