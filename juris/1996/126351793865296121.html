				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant anchors his bid for acquittal on the defense of alibi, but, not heeding the settled doctrines enunciated by this Court in numerous cases, fails to meet the requirements for its plausible application.<br><br>This is an appeal from the judgment of the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> convicting Pedrito Añonuevo y Boral, a.k.a. "Hanger", of the crime of murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> to indemnify the heirs of the victim Rufino Ereño in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b></center><br>This case was commenced by an Information charging the accused-appellant as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 9th day of March 1993, at about 7:30 o’clock in the evening, in Barangay Tubigdanao, Municipality of San Jose, Province of Northern Samar, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused armed with a homemade shotgun, with deliberate intent to kill thru treachery and evident premeditation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack(,) assault and shoot RUFINO EREÑEO (sic) with the use of said weapon which the accused had provided himself for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon said Rufino Ereñeo (sic) several gunshot wounds which caused the instant death of said victim."<br><br>The accused-appellant pleaded Not Guilty when arraigned.</blockquote>Prior to commencement of trial, the prosecution and the accused agreed upon the following stipulation of facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><blockquote>"1. Any mention or reference to the name Pedrito Añonuevo y Boral also known as Hanger identifies the accused;<br><br>2. Fact of death of the victim, Rufino D. Ereño, is reflected in the medico-legal certificate, Exh. ‘A’, page 3, and certificate of death, Exh. ‘B’, page 4 of the case folio;<br><br>3. The time, date and place of the incident, 7:30 o’clock in the evening, March 9, 1993, in Barangay Tubigdanao, Municipality of San Jose, Northern Samar;"</blockquote>The prosecution had as its witnesses Fe Ereño and Julio Ereño, the wife and brother of the victim respectively, and SPO4 Ricardo Sudio, the deputy chief of police in San Jose, Northern Samar. The defense, on the other hand, presented the accused-appellant himself and his wife Nora Añonuevo.<br><br>The victim, Rufino Ereño, was autopsied the day after the incident, and was found to have succumbed to shock secondary to internal hemorrhage as a result of the gunshot wounds he sustained in different parts of the body, the number, nature and locations of which are detailed in the autopsy report (Exhibit "A").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The trial court summarized the circumstances surrounding the killing as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote>"At about 7:30 in the evening on March 9, 1993, at a place less than a kilometer from the barangay proper of Tubigdanao, the family of Rufino Ereño was preparing to retire for the night. The husband was lying down on the side of the one-room affair dwelling hut. Their three children ages seven, six and two and a half, were also inside. Fe Ereño was towards the rear of the house at the kitchen’s yard transferring the small pig to a place inside the house for the evening. She was around three or four brazas to where her husband was. It was there that she heard a gunfire from that direction and saw the accused at a distance of around one-half meter to the house and at the side thereof where her husband lay. The accused was around three brazas to her carrying a long gun in fort position as he withdrew and ran away. She dashed inside the house and saw her husband vomiting blood with injuries at the left of the neck and towards the nape. She ran to the barangay poblacion to the house of one Banker Ballesta, the son of the barangay captain who went to the place of the incident. From there, Ballesta motored to the town and notified Julio Ereño, the victim’s younger brother, who, in turn notified the police.&nbsp; The report was recorded in the police blotter (Exh. "1").&nbsp; It was around 8:00 o’clock in the evening.&nbsp; The body was brought to the town’s district of P. Tingzon where the grieving widow told Julio Ereño and deputy chief of police Ricardo Sudio of the gun wielder to be the accused.<br><br>The accused is long familiar to the Ereño spouses.&nbsp; Fe Ereño used to see him whenever he goes to town.&nbsp; He resides in a farm at another barangay.&nbsp; She told that her husband was killed because whoever makes copra for Juan Añonuevo, the accused’s nephew, would be resented by the accused. The victim used to make copra for Juan Añonuevo at the latter’s coconut land.&nbsp; Other hired hands are residents of Tubigdanao who stopped working for Juan Añonuevo.&nbsp; She heard that the accused prohibited them from working for Juan.&nbsp; The victim last made copra in February, the month before his death.<br><br>Julio Ereño testified that immediately after Ballesta told him of the shooting of his brother, he notified the police at the municipal hall who recorded his report (Exh. "1").&nbsp; He met Fe Ereño, his sister-in-law, later at P. Tingzon in town.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</center><br>The accused testified that the victim was a friend and they see each other often. Fe Ereño was also his friend and knows her since she was small.&nbsp; He branded her accusation as a lie.&nbsp; On March 9, 1993, in the evening he was at home sleeping with his wife and their small child.&nbsp; His house is in San Lorenzo, a barangay around five kilometers to the town.&nbsp; From San Lorenzo to Tubigdanao is around two kilometers accessible only by a footpath and can be negotiated in about ten minutes by walking at a fast pace.&nbsp; He came to know of the death of Rufino Ereño only on the 24th of March, 1993, when he was told he was subpoenaed.&nbsp; He was always at home from March 10, 1993, up to his arrest on March 27.&nbsp; He could not think of any reason as to why Fe Ereño would accuse and testify to impute a crime upon an innocent person.&nbsp; He claims that the killer was not even identified for Julio Ereño, the victim’s brother, reported to the police that the gunman could not be identified (Exh. "1").&nbsp; Juan Añonuevo is his nephew who owns two parcels of land in San Lorenzo which came from the former’s father.&nbsp; His coconut land is situated between these properties of Juan with whom he maintains good relationship.&nbsp; The victim was only one of those hired to make copra by Juan Añonuevo and the last time he made copra was in February this year. Nora Añonuevo, his wife, vouched for his presence at their home during the whole evening of March 9, 1993."<br><br>After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment as follows:<br><br>"WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds Pedrito Añonuevo y Boral, also known as Hanger, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and, with neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances to consider, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, to indemnify the heirs of Rufino Ereño in the amount of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs."</blockquote><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><blockquote>Before this Court, accused-appellant assigns the following errors:[7]<br><br><center><b>"I</b></center><br>The court a quo erred in giving weight and credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and in disregarding the theory of the defense despite the evidence to the contrary.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>The court a quo erred in convicting accused-appellant notwithstanding the fact that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt."</blockquote>In his brief, accused-appellant centers his arguments on two main issues: the credibility of the prosecution’s key witness and the weight to be given the defense of alibi.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling<br><br>First Issue: Credibility of Prosecution Witness</u></b></center><br>Appellant assails the credibility of the main witness for the prosecution, the victim’s wife Fe Ereño.&nbsp; Appellant claims Fe Ereño could not have seen her husband’s assailant, for while she was present at the premises, nevertheless she did not see the actual shooting, as she was at the back of the kitchen busy attending to a piglet, and therefore had no opportunity to get a good view of the assailant.&nbsp; The defense also laid emphasis on the fact that it was nighttime, and the prosecution had not established taht the victim's house was situated in a place where there were no plants and trees in the surroundings which could have obstructed the moonlight from fully illuminating the scene or which might otherwise have prevented Fe Ereño from seeing the person of the assailant.&nbsp; Thus, the accused claims, her identification of appellant as her husband's killer is unreliable and untrustworthy.&nbsp; Her testimony, aside from being biased, is uncorroborated and therefore also insufficient to convict appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>We disagree. The record shows that Fe Ereño was in a position to see her husband's killer. Her testimony was to the effect that her family's dwelling was a small one-room hut. At the time she heard the gunshot, she was in their yard tethering their pig. The yard was near their kitchen, so she was in a good position to see appellant who was at the side of the hut, about three arms-lengths away from her, backing away from the house holding a long firearm in fort position, and then running away.

It has repeatedly been held that the testimony of a single eyewitness if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court as to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Appellant, instead of introducing evidence to show that Fe Ereño had motive to testify falsely against him, even admitted that she had no reason to wrongly accuse him of the death of her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The testimony of Fe Ereño cannot be denied credence just because she happened to be the victim's wife.&nbsp; Mere relationship of a witness to the victim does not automatically impair his credibility and render his testimony less worthy of credence where no improper motive can be ascribed to him for testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Rather, the witness' relationship to the victim, far from rendering her testimony biased, would even make it more credible as it would be unnatural for a relative who is interested in seeking justice for the deceased to accuse somebody other than the real culprit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Second Issue: Is the Alibi Airtight?</u></b></center><br>In the face of the overwhelming evidence against him, appellant relies on the defense of alibi.&nbsp; He testified that he was at home sleeping with his wife and their young child when the shooting was committed.&nbsp; His wife corroborated his story, claiming that her husband was with her at home the whole night of March 9, 1993, and he never left the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The accused-appellant also claims he had no motive to kill Rufino Ereño, insisting that the victim was his friend and that they knew each other quite well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The rule is well-settled that in order for the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that appellant was somewhere else when the offense was committed but it must likewise be demonstrated that he was so far away that it was not possible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>"Alibi, the plea of having been elsewhere than at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission of the felony, is a plausible excuse for the accused.&nbsp; Let there be no mistake about it.&nbsp; Contrary to the common notion, alibi is in fact a good defense.&nbsp; But to be valid for purposes of exoneration from a criminal charge, <u>the defense of alibi must be such that it would have been physically impossible for the person charged with the crime to be at the locus criminis at the time of its commission, the reason being that no person can be in two places at the same time.&nbsp; The excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception.&nbsp; Where there is the least posibility of accused's presence at the crime scene, the alibi will not hold water."</u> (underscoring ours)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>In this case, appellant admitted that the place where the crime was committed could be reached from his place in approximately 10 to 20 minutes on foot.&nbsp; He said:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">"Q</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="LEFT"> How far is Tubigdanao to your house in San Lorenzo?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">It could be around two kilometers away.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">How many minutes would it take to negotiate from Tubigdanao to your house?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">It could be around 20 minutes because there is no road in going there and you have only to hike, but if one is fast in walking it would only take around 10 minutes.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Is there a footpath?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Yes, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In light of the foregoing testimony, the trial court certainly could not be faulted for not giving weight to accused-appellant's alibi. Besides being inherently weak for not being airtight, accused's alibi cannot prevail as against the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Likewise, the testimony of appellant's wife is of little value to his defense, as it only corroborates his leaky alibi. Also, alibi has been held to become less plausible as a defense when it is mainly established by the accused himself and his immediate relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>His defense of lack of motive will likewise not prosper, as motive is immaterial where there is direct testimony of a credible witness and where the culpability of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In any event, the trial court held that "(i)t is not that there is want of any motive at all for the killing", preferring to believe Fe Ereño's testimony to the effect that the accused had threatened the workers who made copra for accused's nephew Juan Añonuevo, and had told them he would treat them as his (accused's) enemies.&nbsp; Everyone but the victim desisted from making copra for Juan Añonuevo; the victim last worked in February, the month before he was killed.<br><br><center><b><u>Treachery Not Proven</u></b></center><blockquote>However, although the trial court observed that:<br><br>"The killing is characterized by the treacherous manner it was perpetrated x x x.&nbsp; The victim certainly had no opportunity to defend himself and he was in no position to mount any defensive maneuver such as would subject the accused to any risk.&nbsp; Killing a sleeping victim was considered an example par excellence of the crime qualified by treachery (citing <i>People vs. Curatchia,</i> 97 SCRA 549 and <i>People vs. Pajanustan,</i> 97 SCRA 699) and the circumstance surrounding the shooting of Rufino Ereño assumes no less consideration even without it being positively shown that he was aslept (sic)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>the evidence fails to show that appellant's attack on Rufino Ereño was committed with treachery.&nbsp; The most that can be said in this case is that the victim was reclining at one side of his one-room dwelling hut when he was shot, with the killer firing from outside the hut.&nbsp; There was no evidence, not even from the testimony of Fe Ereño, that the victim was asleep, or that his back was turned to the accused when the latter fired the shot, or was otherwise in a defenseless position.&nbsp; All that Fe Ereño saw was her husband vomiting blood.&nbsp; It is elementary that <i>alevosia,</i> to be appreciated, must be proven as clearly as the elements of the crime or crimes it is alleged to qualify.&nbsp; This the prosecution had failed to do.&nbsp; It should have proven that the accused had consciously and deliberately employed a form of attack to ensure the consummation of his objective without risk to himself from any defense the person assaulted could have made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> This cannot be said to have been done in the instant case.&nbsp; On the other hand, the trial court ruled out evident premeditation for lack of evidence, to which we agree.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing considerations, the Decision appealed from is hereby <b><i>MODIFIED,</i></b> in that the accused-appellant Pedrito Añonuevo y Boral is found <b><i>GUILTY</i></b> of the crime of <b><i>HOMICIDE,</i></b> and that the penalty imposed upon him is the indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum penalty, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period, there being no aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as maximum penalty.&nbsp; The P50,000.00 civil indemnity for the victim's death is hereby <b><i>AFFIRMED,</i></b> consistent with prevailing jurisprudence.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Melo, and Francisco, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Regional Trial Court, 8th Judicial Region, Branch 19, Catarman, Northern Samar, presided by Judge Cesar R.
