				<BR><STRONG>MELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant administrative case against respondent Judge Isauro M.
Balderian of the Metropolitan Trial Court stationed in Bacoor, <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>
stemmed from an election protest, docketed as Election Case No. 94-31 ans
entitled “Alfredo L. Paredes vs. Corazon Gawaran, et al.,” which was assigned
to said respondent's sala.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its letter-complaint, the Mamamayan ng Zapote 1, Bacoor,
Cavite, alleged that during the May 9, 1994 Barangay Elections, Corazon Gawaran
was declared winner for the position of Barangay Captain of Zapote 1, Bacoor,
Cavite; that due to certain alleged irregularities, Alfredo L. Paredes filed an
election case against Corazon Gawaran; that the case was heard on June 3 and 6,
1994; that after the parties had presented their evidence, respondent asked for
ten days to study the case which was followed by another request five days; and
that despite the lapse of those extensions, respondent failed to resolve the
election case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on said letter-complaint, the Court issued a Resolution
dated <st1:date year="1995" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1995</st1:date>
requiring respondent to comment thereon within ten days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This notwithstanding, respondent failed to
file the required comment and for such failure the Court issued another
Resolution dated August 28, 1995, requiring respondent to show cause why he
should not be disciplinary dealt with and to file the required comment, both
within ten days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
again failed to comply, prompting the Court to impose on him a fine in the
amount of <s>P</s>500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the comment he finally filed, respondent averred that after
the May 9, 1994 Barangay Elections, 4 cases were filed in his sala, 3 of which
were initially assigned to the assisting judge in his sala, while one was heard
by him; that in order to expedite the proceedings, all 4 cases were heard and
tried by the assisting judge but, in the process thereof, the case subject
matter of the present administrative complaint was left behind due to the
volume of cases filed in his sala which averaged about 200 cases a month; that
when his attention was called to the matter, he exerted utmost efforts to give preferential
attention to the case in question; that due to his caseload in the two salas
handled by him, plus the many cases remanded to the lower courts in view of the
expanded jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Courts, it was thus humanly
impossible for him to act on the case with dispatch; and that the case was
finally decided on January 10, 1996.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, in its Resolution dated <st1:date year="1996" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1996</st1:date>, noted both respondent’s comment and letter
informing the Court that he had already paid the <s>P</s>500.00 fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same Resolution, the matter was
referred to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report, and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the Office of the Court Administrator submitted its
Memorandum dated <st1:date year="1996" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1996</st1:date>,
with the following findings and recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>Section 252 of the Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Bldg. 881)
states that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Election contest for barangay offices. -- A sworn petition
contesting the election of a barangay officer shall be filed with the proper
municipal or metropolitan trial court by any candidate who has duly filed a
certificate of candidacy and has been voted for the same office, within ten
days after the proclamation of the results of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court shall decide the election
protest within fifteen days after the filing thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the municipal or metropolitan
trial court may be appealed within ten days after receipt of a copy thereof by
the aggrieved party to the regional trial court which shall decide the case
within thirty days from its submission, and whose decisions shall be final.
(Art. XVIII, Sec. 191, 1978 EC; Sec. 20, BP 222)</p>

<blockquote>A cursory review of the records show that Election Case No. 94-31
was filed with respondent court on <st1:date year="1994" day="20" month="5">20
 May 1994</st1:date> and heard on 3 and <st1:date year="1994" day="6" month="6">6
 June 1994</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation
in the letter-complaint was not disputed by the respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the aforequoted provision, respondent court should have heard
and decided the case within fifteen (15) days after filing thereof or on <st1:date year="1994" day="4" month="6">4 June 1994</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an election case which ought to have
been decided with dispatch; instead, respondent judge rendered the Decision
only on <st1:date year="1996" day="10" month="1">10 January 1996</st1:date>,
involving a delay of one (1) year and seven (7) months.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Administrative Circular No. 7-94 dated <st1:date year="1994" day="25" month="4">25 April 1994</st1:date> specifically directed among others
the Metropolitan and the Municipal Trial Courts to try, hear and decide all
cases involving violations of the Election Code as expeditiously as possible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Failure to decide a case within the given period is not excusable
and constitute gross inefficiency.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Asinas vs. Judge Trinidad, 242 SCRA 710) Clearly this delay is
attributable to respondent Judge who in his Comment admitted the delay
interposing as excuse therefore the heavy caseloads in the court he is handling.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Statistics on pending cases in the MTC, Bacoor, <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>
during the period 1 January to <st1:date year="1994" day="31" month="12">31
 December 1994</st1:date> and 1 January to <st1:date year="1995" day="31" month="12">31 December 1995</st1:date> a show a rather high incidence of cases
filed totaling 1,181 and 1,591 respectively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This could have been brought about by the expanded jurisdiction of the
MTCs which took effect on <st1:date year="1994" day="15" month="4">15 April
 1994</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite a remarkable
713 and 804 case disposition for this two-year period with Judge Jimmy H.F.
Luczon, Jr. as Assisting Judge, respondent’s pending cases in the MTC, Bacoor,
Cavite rose from 729 in 1 January 1994 to 1,984 in 31 December 1995.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On the other hand, statistics on
pending cases in the 5</span><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> MCTC Carmona-Gen. Mariano Alvarez, Cavite shows a
total of 531 and 468 cases filed during the period 1 January to 3 December 1994
and 1 January to 31 December 1995, respectively, with a total of a767 case
disposition during the same periods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
number of pending cases rose from 180 in 1 January 1994 to </span><st1:date year="1995" day="31" month="12"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">424 in 31
 December 1995</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Assisting judge in this 5</span><sup><span style="font-size: 8pt;">th</span></sup><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> MCTC is
also Judge Jimmy H.F. Luczon, Jr.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While it cannot be denied that many trial courts, including that of
the respondent’s, are burdened with heavy caseloads, it is nevertheless
imperative to stress that respondent Judge has the “obligation to diligently
discharge administrative responsibilities and maintain professional competence
in court management.” (Arvisu vs. Judge Sumilang, 241 SCRA 577)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This includes the adoption of an effective
case flow management system.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering however the veritable deluge of cases in two salas
handled by Judge Balderian and the high rate of disposal of cases thereat by
the judge and his assisting judge, we are inclined to believe that the
non-resolution of the election case complained of within the period fixed by
law was a regrettable oversight.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nevertheless, this should not totally free the judge from any
liability thereunder, as it might set a dangerous precedent and provide judges
equally situated with a convenient excuse for delay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent has been with the Judiciary for the past thirteen (13)
years, eight (8) months and five (5) days and will be compulsory retired by <st1:date year="2013" day="1" month="8">1 August 2013</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Premises considered, it is respectfully recommended that respondent
judge be REPRIMANDED WITH WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar
offense will be dealt with more severely. (pp.2-4, Memorandum)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the findings of the Office of the Court
Administrator that respondent is indeed guilty of gross inefficiency for
failure to decide the election case within the mandated period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Court exist to dispense and promote justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conduct of a judge should be
free from any appearance of impropriety, and his personal behavior not only
upon the bench and in the performance of official duties but also in his
everyday life should be beyond reproach (Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial
Conduct).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the visible
representation of law and more importantly of justice, he must be the
embodiment of competence, integrity and independence and should be studiously
careful to avoid even the slightest infraction of the law (OCA vs. Gines, 224
SCRA 261 [1993]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, he is
required to observe due care in the performance of his official duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must dispose of the court’s business
promptly and decide cases within the required periods (Rule 3.05 of Canon 3 of
the Code of Judicial Conduct).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
knowledge of internal rules and procedures, especially those which relate to
the scope of his authority, he is in duty bound required to observe and abide
by these rules and procedures which are primarily intended to ensure the
orderly administration of justice (Cuaresma vs. Aguilar, 226 SCRA 73 [1993]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on Section 252 of the Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa
Bldg. 881), it is clear that it is the ministerial duty of respondent to
resolve election protest within fifteen days from the filing thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, respondent was remiss in the
performance of his duties when he failed to resolve the election protest within
said period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent should have
resolved the election protest with dispatch at the latest on <st1:date year="1994" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1994</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead it was only on <st1:date year="1996" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1996</st1:date>, or after one year and seven
months to be exact, that the said election protest was finally resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such failure of respondent to decide the
election protest within the required period is not excusable and constitutes
gross inefficiency (Ancheta vs. Antonio, 231 SCRA 74 [1994]; citing Longboan
vs. Polig, 186 SCRA 557; and Sabado vs. Cajigal, 219 SCRA 800 [1993]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent has violated Rule 3.01 of Canon 3
of the Code of Conduct which calls for a judge to be faithful to the law and to
maintain professional competence, and also Rule 3.05 which admonishes all
judges to dispose of the court’s business promptly and to decide case within
the period fixed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, respondent has also violated Administrative
Circular No. 7-94 dated <st1:date year="1994" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1994</st1:date>
which directs, among other things, the Metropolitan and the Municipal Trial
Courts to try, hear, and decide all cases involving violations of the Election
Code as expeditiously as possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent can not escape liability by reasoning that his failure
to decide the election case promptly was due to the heavy caseloads in the
courts he presided over.</p>

<p class="BODY">A judge ought to know the cases submitted to him for decision or
resolution and is expected to keep his own record of cases so that he may act
on them promptly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is incumbent upon
him to devise an efficient recording and filing system in his court so that no
disorderliness can effect the flow of cases and their speedy disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proper and efficient court management is
asmuch his responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is the one
directly responsible for the proper discharge of his official functions
(Agcaoili vs. Ramos, 229 SCRA 705 [1994] citing Nidera vs. Lazaro, Adm. Matter
No. R-465 MTJ, June 29, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that respondent has an overload of cases in the
MTC, Bacoor, Cavite and in the 5th MCTC Carmona-Gen. Mariano Alvarez Cavite,
this is not a valid and justifiable reason for him not to resolve Election Case
No. 94-31 expeditiously and promptly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court cannot close its eyes to the fact that respondent took one (1)
year and seven (7) months to resolve the election protest, when this should
have been done within the mandatory period of only 15 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going over the decision of respondent on the subject election
protest, the Court finds the case to be simple and uncomplicated as the main
issue raised therein was whether or not the alleged irregularities committed
during the barangay election were serious and sufficient enough to declare a
failure of election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the case
merely involved a barangay position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
sum, the delay of respondent in deciding the election protest is inexcusable,
unwarranted, and unreasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need but recall, in this regard, the caveat pronounced in
Castro vs. Malazo (99 SCRA 164 [1980]), to wit:</p>

<blockquote>We must once more impress upon the members of the Judiciary their
sworn duty of administering justice without undue delay under the time-honored
precept that justice delayed, is justice denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present clogged condition of the courts’
docket in all levels of our judicial system cannot be cleared unless each and
every judge earnestly and painstakingly takes it upon himself to comply
faithfully with the mandate of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No less important than the speedy termination of hearings and trials of
cases is the promptness and dispatch in the making of decisions and judgment,
the signing thereof and filing the same with the Clerk of Court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Judge Isauro M. Balderian is found
guilty of gross inefficiency, for which infraction he is hereby ordered to pay
a fine in the amount of Two Thousand (<s>P</s>2,000.00), with the stern warning
that future similar misconduct on his part will be dealt with more severely</p>
