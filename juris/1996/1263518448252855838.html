				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant Angelito Talledo was charged with, and convicted of, the crime of rape, under an information that read:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned Asst. Provincial Prosecutor on complaint of the offended party Rosario Mariano y Brojas accuses Angelito Talledo of the crime of rape, penalized under the provisions of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about the 22nd day of July, 1992, in the municipality of San Miguel, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Angelito Talledo, by means of force, threats and intimidation and with lewd design (had) carnal knowledge of the said offended party against her will.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>Accused-appellant, when arraigned, pleaded "not guilty" to the charge.<br><br>At the trial, the prosecution presented its version, hereunder summarized, of the facts that gave rise to the accusation.<br><br>The private complainant, Rosario (Charito) Mariano, is a young housewife with three children.&nbsp; The husband works in Manila.<br><br>At around two o'clock in the afternoon of 22 July 1992, while Rosario was alone<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> at home washing the dishes, the accused, Angelito Talledo, arrived purportedly to buy some ice.&nbsp; He was drunk.&nbsp; Rosario told the accused that they had none available and, since he somewhat appeared to tarry, she begged him to leave.&nbsp; He refused.&nbsp; After a while, Rosario left to ask the relatives of the accused (whose residence was about twenty houses away) for their help.&nbsp; Talledo's grandmother accompanied Rosario back to the latter's house.&nbsp; They found the accused taking a nap on a wooden bed (<i>"papag"</i>).&nbsp; He was awakened and requested to go home but, again, he refused.<br><br>Talledo's grandmother left but not before she had assured Rosario that the accused would not do her any harm.&nbsp; Rosario continued with her work and did the chore outside the house.&nbsp; She was still washing the dishes when Talledo suddenly grabbed her and forced her back inside the house.&nbsp; She struggled to free herself until she accidentally bumped her head on the wall that made her almost lost consciousness.&nbsp; When she recovered, she found herself already being raped by the accused.&nbsp; She shouted but the din of the rain muffled her cries.&nbsp; Talledo succeeded in satisfying his bestial desire.&nbsp; His mind evidently still befuddled by alcohol, Talledo went outside the house and, in a loud voice, proclaimed his "success." Rosario promptly reported the matter over to Roger Pineda, the <i>barangay</i> captain, whose wife later accompanied Rosario to the San Miguel Emergency Hospital.&nbsp; The physical examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> disclosed that Rosario suffered from -<br><blockquote>"Superficial laceration, Right cheek.<br>Contusion, neck, lateral, Right.<br>Contusion to anterior-posterior chest.<br>Contusion to upper extremities, Left and Right.<br>Hematoma, occipital area, Right.<br>Vaginal smear = positive for sperm cells."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>The accused did not deny having had sex with private complainant; indeed, he asserted that, being "lovers," the two had indulged in the act in not a few occasions.<br><br>On 14 December 1994, the trial court found for the prosecution and held Talledo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape.&nbsp; The Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; held:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused ANGELITO TALLEDO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>A notice of appeal was filed by Talledo.&nbsp; His thesis:<br><br>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE BY GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINING WITNESS."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>The defense attempts, by and large, to discredit private complainant due to supposed inconsistencies in her testimony narrated before the court below.<br><br>Regrettably, the Court does not see it that way.<br><br>Appellant would bewail the fact that Rosario said that she was sleeping when Talledo arrived at her house but that in her later testimony she stated that she was not sleeping but washing the dishes.&nbsp; Rosario explained the matter rather well when cross-examined.<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">"Q</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="LEFT">During your direct testimony you said that about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon on the date of the incident the accused knocked at your door buying some ice and you told there was no ice, so this is not true?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"Q </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">And what were you doing at that time?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">I was washing the dishes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">But during the last hearing you said on direct examination on page 5 of the tsn at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon while you were sleeping?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"Witness:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"></div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"A </div></th><td><div align="LEFT">I just woke up and then I washed the dishes, sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>It was quite strange, appellant would insist, that Rosario could recall things that transpired even while in a state of unconsciousness.&nbsp; Rosario declared that while the accused was dragging her into the house, her head bumped against the wall and she became unconscious; yet, she was able to tell being carried into the house by accused-appellant.&nbsp; Similarly, she said that accused-appellant had hit her with his fist causing her to lose consciousness; yet she could remember that accused-appellant threw her on the bed and threatened to kill her if she resisted.&nbsp; The defense here exaggerated.&nbsp; This was how Rosario testified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="14%"><div align="LEFT">"Q</div></th><td width="86%"><div align="LEFT">What else happened after he carried you?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">"A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">While he was carrying me, he was talking to me and saying I will kill you.

But, in fact, she did.&nbsp; When appellant had refused to leave, she asked Talledo's relatives to help her.&nbsp; When, despite his grandmother's plea, Talledo still would not leave, Rosario did not stay <u>inside,</u> but resumed to do her chore of washing the dishes <u>outside,</u> the house.&nbsp; The accused's grandmother also assured Rosario that Talledo would not cause her any harm.<br><br>The defense branded "absurd and incredulous" Rosario's claim that after committing the rape, Talledo went out of the house and in the open announced that he had "succeeded" in raping private complainant.&nbsp; Appellant must have forgotten that he was then drunk.&nbsp; The act he had committed, in his inebriated state, was an act he believed he could vaunt about.&nbsp; Neither, on the part of Rosario, was it strange that she shouted for help even after the assault was over.&nbsp; She certainly was not proclaiming her disgrace but clearly she just wanted to condemn outrightly the dastardly act.&nbsp; She indeed promptly reported the incident to the <i>Barangay</i> Captain.&nbsp; In any event, varied behavioral responses could be expected in the proximity of, or in confronting, an uncommon occurrence.<br><br>It is when the testimony appears totally flawless that a court can have some misgivings on its veracity.&nbsp; A few inconsistencies can be anticipated from even the most dependable and candid witness.&nbsp; In fact, certain minor variances in the details of a witness' account, more frequently than not, can be badges of truth rather than <i>indicia</i> of falsehood,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and they often bolster the probative value of testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The Court, in conclusion, finds no reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial a quo.&nbsp; Repeatedly, this Court has sustained the trial court in this respect, considering its vantage point in the evaluation of testimonial evidence, absent, of course, any showing of serious error or irregularity that, otherwise, would alter the results of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>An award of moral damages was unfortunately missed by the trial court; Article 2219 of the Civil Code would mandate it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment of the court a quo finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape, and sentencing him accordingly, is <b>AFFIRMED,</b> subject to the modification that accused-appellant is likewise ordered to indemnify private complainant, Rosario Mariano y Brojas, the sum of P30,000.00 by way of moral damages.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Padilla, Bellosillo, Kapunan, and Hermosisima, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Rollo, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; The children were in school.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; Conducted by Edgar S.
