REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Dr. Renato Bautista, the Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI, concluded that the cause of death was asphyxia compatible with strangulation.&nbsp; While Dr. Bautista conceded that an autopsy on a fresh cadaver would normally by more reliable in determining the cause of death than that conducted at a later time, much would depend, however, he said, on how the autopsy was undertaken and on the condition of the cadaver.&nbsp; It would appear that the post-mortem investigation on the cadaver conducted by the NBI was decidedly more extensive and exhaustive than the cursory examination previously made by the police.&nbsp; Dr. Bautista testified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0"

Appellant clearly testified that his purpose for demanding from the victim to talk inside their room was due to their non-appearance on the wedding day of Rowena (appellant’s sister), who incidentally was not in speaking terms with the victim, and the hurt feelings generated on appellant’s friends and relatives on account of their non-attendance (pp. 23-25, tsn, September 10, 1993; pp. 4-5, tsn, August 12, 1993).<br><br>"Second, the fact that appellant and the victim proceeded upstairs inside their bedroom and were alone at the time the incident occurred (p. 9, tsn, August 12, 1993).<br><br>"Third, the violent commotion inside the bedroom of the appellant and the victim exemplified by loud thuds or ‘kalabog’ and shouts of anger of the victim to the appellant which the latter even acknowledged (pp. 24-26, tsn, September 10, 1993; pp. 5 &amp; 13, tsn, August 12, 1993).<br><br>"Fourth, the duration of the violent commotion which lasted for approximately ten minutes evinces that a violent struggle took place (pp. 5, 13-14, tsn, August 12, 1993).<br><br>"Fifth, the fact that the appellant was seen together with his brother-in-law carrying the victim downstairs immediately after the said commotion took place (p. 5, tsn, August 12, 1993).<br><br>"Sixth, the physical condition of the room evincing that a violent struggle took place characterized by the presence of a bolo on top of the table in the room with its bedsheets and pillows disarrayed, the built-in cabinet doors open, clothes and perfume bottles scattered (p. 13, tsn, August 16, 1993; p. 6, August 12, 1993; p. 13, tsn, August 6, 1993).<br><br>"Seventh, the <u>corpus delicti</u> indicating that the victim was strangled to death exemplified by contuse-abrasions on the victim’s neck and other parts of the body characterized by marked congestions on the superior part of the first portion of the trachea and the thyroid cartilage which was even detected by the NBI Medico Legal Officer Dr. Bautista at the time he conducted an autopsy on the victim’s body (p. 10, tsn, August 6, 1993, p. 20, tsn, June 21, 1993; Exhibits ‘F,’ ‘F-1,’ ‘F-2,’ ‘F-3,’ ‘F-4’).<br><br>"Eighth, the attempt on the part of the appellant to mislead the police investigators and cover-up the corpus delicti by making it to appear in his ‘Sinumpaang Salaysay’ (Exhibit ‘N’) that the victim died due to suicidal hanging (p. 8, tsn, September 10, 1993)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>All the above, taken collectively, sufficiently constituted an unbroken chain of events that indeed would point to accused-appellant, to the exclusion of all others, to be the author of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>.&nbsp;
