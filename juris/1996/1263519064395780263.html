Alexander M. Mortel. The information avers in part:<br><blockquote>"... the above-named accused, for the purpose of enabling them to commit election frauds, did then and there, with evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, unlawfully, criminally and feloniously conspire, confederate and help one another in removing and kidnapping SALVADOR F. LEAÑO [SR.] from his post as election watcher for the UNIDO in Precinct No. 11 of San Andres, Romblon, by forcibly taking him out of said precinct at gunpoint and forcing him to board with them in a red IZUZU jeep with Plate No. SHX-702 and thereafter killed him by shooting him and inflicting upon him mortal wounds in different parts of his body after which they concealed his body by burying him in a secluded grassy area in the ranch of the father-in-law of the accused Nemesio V. Ganan, Jr. in barangay Pili, Looc, Romblon where it was found decomposing six (6) days later and as a consequence thereof, his heirs incurred actual expenses for the recovery and burial of his body in the amount of P60,000.00 and to suffer moral damages in the sum of P500,000.00 due to physical suffering, mental anguish, serious anxiety and fright, and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Notably, in both the original and amended informations, the witnesses listed are the same, namely: Mrs. Dory M. Fabella, Mr. Gregorio Panaguiton, Mr. Val Leaño, Jr., Pag-alad, Ex-Mayor Daniel Mortel, Dr. Marcelino P. Badillo, and Mrs. Liwanag Leaño, and others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><b>APRIL 14, 1992:</b> A motion for the cancellation of the bail of the accused Nemesio V.

Ganan, Jr.<br><br><b>JULY 27, 1992:</b> The trial court denied the motion for the cancellation of the bail filed by the prosecution. The order reads in part:<br><blockquote>"The affidavits (Exhibits `1' and `2') executed by Gregorio Panaguiton and Dory Fabella, clearly repudiated the contents of their previous affidavits (dated February 17, 1986), as not true and correct, because they were merely made to sign these affidavits which were already prepared while they were in Looc, Romblon. The affidavit of Dory Fabella (Exhibit `2') further states, that the content of said affidavit of February 17, 1986, were suggested and supplied by Daniel Mortel, the former Municipal Mayor of San Andres, Romblon. The contents of their affidavits of February 17, 1986, were not based on their (witnesses’) own personal perception. They could not be taken or considered as credible. Their subsequent affidavits (Exhibits `I' and `2') plus the subsequent affidavit (Exhibit `3') executed by Benjamin Galicia, repudiating his previous affidavit made the evidence for the prosecution in support of its motion for the cancellation of the bail for the accused weak and therefore did not fully meet or satisfy the requirement under Sec. 13 of Article III of our Constitution ‘when the evidence of guilt is strong’."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><b>DECEMBER 20, 1993:</b> A motion to discharge accused Delmar Alubog to be a state witness was filed by the prosecution on the ground that "for lack of a witness who directly and actually saw how the deceased Salvador Leaño was shot and killed after being kidnapped at the Voting Center in the mountain barangay of Jun Carlo, San Andres, Romblon, and how his cadaver happened to be buried in a shallow grave in the ranch of the father-in-law of accused Nemesio V. Ganan, Jr. in barangay Pili, Looc, Romblon, more than fifty (50) kilometers away where his cadaver was found seven (7) days later, there is absolute necessity for the testimony of accused Delmar Alubog whose discharge is requested in order to establish clearly and unmistakably beyond any shadow of doubt who was or were responsible for the commission of the heinous crime, which testimony could not be supplied by any available witness except that of the accused Delmar Alubog."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><b>JANUARY 10, 1994:</b> A supplemental motion for the discharge of Delmar Alubog to become a state witness was filed by the prosecution alleging that:<br><blockquote>"[A]s shown in said sworn statement (ANNEX-A) the testimony of accused Delmar Alubog is absolutely necessary to clinch the evidence for the prosecution in the above-entitled case and leave no room for any doubt that accused Nemesio V. Ganan, Jr. and his co-accused are guilty of the crime charged in the above-entitled case; however, in view of the provision contained in the last paragraph of Section 9, Rule 119, of the Revised Rules of Court which reads:<br><br>‘Evidence adduced in support of the discharge shall automatically form part of the trial. If the court denies the motion for the discharge of the accused as state witness, the sworn statement shall be inadmissible in evidence.’<br><br>and of Section 20, Article IV of the New Constitution which provides that ‘no person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself,’ the discharge of Delmar Alubog as one of the accused in the above-entitled case is absolutely necessary and imperative."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><b>JANUARY 13, 1994:</b> Accused Delmar Alubog, assisted by counsel de oficio, also pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.<br><br><b>MARCH 15, 1994:</b> An opposition to the prosecution’s motion to discharge accused Delmar Alubog to become a state witness was filed by the accused Nemesio V. Ganan, Jr. It alleged in part: ". . .&nbsp; the Prosecution has illegally obtained the `sworn statement’ of the accused Alubog, only a few days after Prosecution filed the Motion, and while the accused was under detention; in fact the Prosecution even tried to represent the accused during the scheduled arraignment on January 11, 1994; the Private Prosecutor had actually stood up to do so; but the attempt was noted as improper when the undersigned counsel called the attention of the Court which postponed the arraignment of the accused Alubog to January 13, 1994 in order to let him be represented by a counsel of his choice or by counsel de oficio, and not by Private Prosecutor Victoriano, brother of the Public Prosecutor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><b>MARCH 28, 1994:</b> A memorandum of authorities and jurisprudence in support of its motion to discharge Delmar Abulog to become a state witness was filed by the prosecution.<br><br><b>JUNE 29, 1994:</b> A manifestation was filed by the accused Delmar Alubog to the effect that "he never offered himself to become a state witness and that his sworn statement marked as Annex ‘A’ of the prosecution’s supplemental motion for [his] discharge was improperly procured and should therefore be expunged from the records."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b>JULY 13, 1994:</b> Accused Harley S.

The gist of their testimonies is reproduced hereunder in seriatim:<br><blockquote><b>Agustin Tan,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the prosecution’s lone eyewitness, essentially narrated that: During the February 7, 1986, snap presidential election, he was appointed as election inspector by ex-assemblyman Natalio Beltran, Jr., the chairman of the Unido party of Romblon province, and assigned at Precinct No. 11 in Barangay Jun Carlo, San Andres, Romblon. The provincial chairman of the KBL party in Romblon was Nemesio Ganan, Jr. Salvador Leaño, Sr., the victim, was a watcher for the Unido party.<br><br>In the early morning of February 7, 1986, Tan was at home in Barangay Pag-alad preparing for some provisions as he was then scheduled to go to Barangay Jun Carlo. Before heading to the said barangay, he cast his vote in a precinct at Barangay Pag-alad, San Andres, Romblon as a registered voter. En route to Barangay Jun Carlo, Tan took a jeep with Daniel Mortel, Sulpicio Gadon, Oscar Vergara, Salvador Leaño, Sr., Benjamin Galicia and Dory Fabella on board. Upon his arrival, Tan, together with Dory Fabella who was then the designated assistant watcher of the victim; Benjamin Galicia, the assigned assistant inspector; and the victim proceeded to Precinct No. 11 where they gave their respective appointments to the chairman of the voting center, Jessie Famadico. The other election inspectors present at the voting center were Poll Clerk Ludy Gaac and Siony Galus, inspector for the KBL party.<br><br>While voting was going on, a red jeep arrived. From the road, the red jeep moved backwards toward the voting center and stopped about five meters away from the door of the voting center. Appellant Nemesio alighted from the jeep, headed to the door of the voting center and called the victim, who was then inside, to come out. The victim did not oblige as he answered that he had work to accomplish. Nemesio went back to the red jeep and there he instructed appellants Delmar Alubog and Harley Fabicon who were inside the jeep to pull the victim out. Both armed with a gun, Alubog and Fabicon advanced to the voting center, with the former entering the voting center and the latter staying at the doorway. Pointing a gun at the victim’s back, Alubog started to push the victim. Fabicon went inside and helped pushed the victim out; and outside, the victim was ordered to board the jeep. Nemesio who was then near the side of the jeep "lowered the curtain (trapal) in the side of the jeep [sic] and in the other side [sic] the same thing was done by Virgilio Ganan, the driver."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The jeep left with Nemesio and Virgilio seated at the front seat, with Virgilio driving the wheels. The victim, meanwhile, "was seated on the left seat, second from the rear, sandwiched by . . .&nbsp; Fabicon and . . .&nbsp; Alubog."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> There were ten (10) persons inside the jeep including the victim.<br><br>The incident, as well as the temporary stoppage and subsequent resumption of voting, was noted in the minutes of the voting proceedings by Ludy Gaac. The minutes, written in Tagalog, was signed by Ludy Gaac, Famadico, Siony Galus and by Tan himself.<br><br>After the red jeep left, Daniel Mortel arrived and he narrated the incident to him. "Gregorio Panaguiton, a Namfrel [member], who was standing with others outside the voting center, boarded a motorcycle driven by one Noche [and] followed the red jeep."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Mortel also followed.&nbsp; Minutes later, they heard a gunfire. Upon hearing it, he asked Poll Clerk Ludy Gaac for the time who answered 9:15 a.m. Thereafter, they continued their work. At 3:00 o’clock p.m. voting stopped and counting of the votes followed ending at 5:00 o’clock p.m. He subsequently hiked carrying the ballot box from Barangay Jun Carlo to the town proper together with Jessie Famadico and Judy Gaac. On their way, they noticed streaks of blood about one and a half kilometers (1 1/2 km.) long starting near the voting center. When they arrived, he delivered the box to Councilor Domingo Tacasa and afterwards he went home. Several days after, he saw the victim at the victim’s house lying inside a coffin.<br><br><b>Salvador Leaño, Jr.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> substantially testified that: Late in the afternoon of February 5, 1986, Nemesio went to their place where Nemesio forbade his father, the victim, from going to Barangay Jun Carlo on election day because something wrong might happen. However, on election day and after casting his vote in Barangay Pag-alad, the victim proceeded to Barangay Jun Carlo. At around 11:00 o’clock of the same day, Salvador Leaño, Jr., received an information about some gunshots and blood on the road. He went to the provincial hospital to look for his father, but did not find him. Thus, he reported the disappearance of his father to the police station. In the morning of February 10, 1986, in the company of others, he searched for the whereabouts of his father. In Looc, Romblon, which their group reached in searching he inquired from Nemesio where the victim was and Nemesio replied that the victim alighted at the steel bridge. In the afternoon of February 13, 1986, a report reached Salvador Leaño, Jr. involving a decomposing body found buried in a shallow grave at Pili, Looc, Romblon, to where he and his companions went. He viewed the cadaver and based on the pants, dress, belt, shoes and bible found within the make shift grave, he concluded that the cadaver is his father.<br><br><b>Liwanag Leaño,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the victim’s wife, corroborated Salvador’s testimony and also identified the cadaver to be her husband. She also testified that the expenses for the coffin and the wake amounted to P20,000.00. She asked for the amount of P500,000.00 as damages.<br><br><b>Rudy Leaño,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the nephew of the victim essentially narrated that: He was with the group that went out to look for the victim. The decomposing body was found in the shallow grave inside the ranch of appellant Nemesio’s father-in-law at Pili, Looc, Romblon. He took some pictures of the cadaver, as well as the autopsy conducted on it, and identified these pictures during the trial.<br><br><b>Dr. Renato Bautista,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> a member of the National Bureau of Investigation, conducted an autopsy on the cadaver at San Andres, Romblon and testified that: He found two wounds, one, an entry wound at the back of the cadaver’s head, and two, an exit wound located almost at the apex of the head. He concluded that a gunshot could have been the cause of the wounds, but found it difficult to identify the caliber of a gun which could have caused the wounds.<br><br><b>Sunny Talamisan,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the last witness for the prosecution, is the victim’s nephew who substantially testified that: He was then the Chief of Police of San Andres, Romblon. On February 7, 1986 at around 9:00 o’clock a.m. while on his way to Barangay Jun Carlo, he saw Nemesio and Virgilio seated on the front seat of a speedily moving jeep. He failed to see the passengers of the jeep, although the jeep’s window shield or ‘trapal’ was rolled up. At around 4:00 o’clock p.m. of February 7, 1986, he received a report that Nemesio, together with his bodyguards, kidnapped the victim. The next day, he met Nemesio in the house of the latter’s parents-in-law where he inquired about the victim’s location. Nemesio answered that the victim was at the steel bridge in San Andres and added that Talamisan should continue his search. On February 13, 1986, he received an information from Looc Police Station involving a cadaver buried at Pili, Looc, Romblon. He formed a team and on their way to Looc, they were joined by Rudy Leaño and several others. They found the cadaver which he identified as the victim. They prepared the necessary complaint against Nemesio, Virgilio, Fabicon, Alubog and other unknown persons. Warrants of arrest were issued, but were not served as the accused can not anymore be located.</blockquote>For its part, the defense presented the following witnesses: Mrs. Jessie Famadico, a public school teacher, chairman of the Board of Inspectors of Precinct No. 11, and a niece of the victim; Siony Galus, Tan’s neighbor and his daughter’s godmother and the election inspector assigned to Precinct No. 11 in Barangay Jun Carlo.

There was neither interruption nor suspension of the voting in her precinct. She knew the victim as he is her uncle who, at around 9:30 a.m., presented his appointment as Unido watcher which she did not accept since there were already two watchers for the Unido and that her uncle was not a registered voter of the precinct. She belied Tan’s claim anent the forcible taking of her uncle and stated such incident never happened. She declared Tan was not a member of the Board of Election Inspectors. Neither was Tan present when they delivered the ballot box to Mr. Jose Mingoa, the COMELEC Registrar.<br><br><b>Siony Galus</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> narrated that: She was a member of the Board of Election Inspectors of Precinct No. 11 of Jun Carlo, San Andres, Romblon, and stayed at the precinct the whole day.

She did not see Tan inside the precinct. It was her husband who carried the ballot box from the precinct up to the Health Center. The ballot box was thereafter given to Jessie Famadico who took a ride in the company of Ludy Gaac and others in proceeding to the town proper.

Tan requested him to arrange a meeting with Nemesio for Tan to apologize for testifying in a case Tan knew nothing about as he (Tan) was merely paid to lie. Tan and Nemesio had a meeting and there Tan apologized which apology Nemesio accepted as they cannot do anything to extract Tan’s testimony from the records. He did not ask Tan to sign any retraction paper.<br><br><b>Alejandro Minaño,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> an octogenarian and a farmer from Alcantara, Romblon testified that: Nemesio went to his house in Romblon at 9:30 a.m. on February 7, 1986 and conferred with some KBL leaders.

From Calatrava, he proceeded to Romblon arriving there at around 9:40 a.m. At 10:30 a.m. he went to Tablas, then headed back home for lunch and asked his wife to join him in voting. He voted at 1:00 o’clock p.m. on February 7, 1986.<br><br>On February 10, 1986, he was at the house of his parents-in-law where he received some visitors among them were Talamisan, Salvador Leaño, Jr., Mayor Gadon and others who were looking for the victim. On February 11, 1986, he left for Manila upon the call of Malacañang in relation to the recently concluded presidential election. From February 11 to 17, he attended the canvassing of the results of the elections at the Batasan Pambansa. On February 27, 1986, he was advised, through a letter from the Presidential Assistant for Information, Gualberto Lumauig, to leave the country to avoid persecution by the Aquino government. He thereafter left for the U.S. He was one of those who was included in a plane load of people who accompanied Mrs. Imelda Marcos in her return to the Philippines. The version of the prosecution witnesses to the effect that he stated that the victim disembarked at the steel bridge was a mere fabrication by Atty. Victoriano who was not yet fiscal at the time and who considered him an enemy.</blockquote>The pivotal issue is one of credibility. In this connection, the prosecution leans heavily on the testimony of Agustin Tan, the lone eyewitness to the incident. We have meticulously examined Agustin Tan’s account relative to the alleged kidnapping and murder of the victim, Salvador Leaño, Sr. We find the same fraught with contradictions and inconsistencies and inherent incredibilities that we cannot agree, much more approve of, the trial court’s reliance on his testimony as a basis for convicting the appellants. While it is settled that conclusions and findings of fact of the trial court, as well as the assessment of the witnesses’ credibility, are binding on us, yet it is equally settled that this rule admits of an exception, i.e., where the trial court ignored and overlooked facts and circumstances of weight and influence which when considered could alter the result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In the case at bench, we find that there is more to the exception than to the rule.<br><br><i>Unexplained silence of the eyewitness evokes disbelief.</i><br><br>What initially struck the Court’s attention as to cautiously and skeptically consider the testimony of Agustin Tan, the sole eyewitness, is his long silence about the incident which remained unbroken until during the questioning conducted by the fiscal on September 27, 1993. No reason was proffered for Agustin Tan’s silence for seven years despite his professed close ties of friendship with the victim and his family. Indeed, if any iota of credibility were to be attached to this witness, the most natural thing for him to have done was to bring the matter to the proper authorities or to the superior officials of the COMELEC and offer himself as a witness especially as he claimed himself to be an election officer, i.e., a member of the Board of Inspectors. This he failed to do. In fact, Agustin Tan did not even inform his wife and other close relatives of what he had witnessed immediately thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> On this score, we lift from <i>People v. Quiritan,</i> the following:<br><blockquote>"Altogether, the prosecution proffered no convincing explanation why two supposedly material witnesses were not presented to the police investigators. The almost two-year silence of Pacolanang and Sabanal may well give rise to the suspicion that they were ill-motivated and unworthy of credence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><i>Contradictions and Improbabilities in Agustin Tan’s identification of the accused.</i><br><br>In his direct testimony, Tan categorically stated that he saw appellant Nemesio disembark from the red jeep, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">"Q:</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="LEFT">Can you tell the Court whom you saw alighted from the jeep?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A:</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Nemesio V.

Where the principal and basic evidence upon which the prosecution rests its case fails, all evidence intended to support or corroborate it must likewise fail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Proceeding to accused Delmar Alubog who did not appeal, we advert to Rule 122, Section 11 (a) of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 11. <i>Effect of appeal by any of several accused. </i>-<br><br>(a) An appeal taken by one or more of several accused shall not affect those who did not appeal, except insofar as the judgment of the appellate court is favorable and applicable to the latter."</blockquote>Note must be taken that the appeal shall not affect those who did not appeal,<b>"except insofar as the judgment is favorable and applicable to the latter."</b> Since the decision is favorable and applicable to Delmar Alubog, he is affected by and should benefit from it.[85]<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision of Branch 82 of the Regional Trial Court of Odiongan, Romblon in Criminal Case No. CD-203 is <b>REVERSED</b> and appellants Nemesio V.
