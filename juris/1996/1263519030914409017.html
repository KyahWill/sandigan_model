Miguel Diaz, she arrived at Talalora, Samar to audit an infrastructure project.&nbsp; In going to the project site, they were guided by the late Anastacio Macato.&nbsp; On their way to the project site, a person shouted and said: ‘You are being a traitor to us fellowmen from Talalora’.&nbsp; Several others also expressed threatening words to the late Anastacio Macato but the latter told Figueroa not to mind them.&nbsp; She recognized said persons as the herein seven accused (TSN, 1-13-89, pp. 3-13).<br><br>Her testimony was corroborated by Miguel Diaz who testified that he was the one who requested the late Anastacio Macato to go with them to the barangay where the project was located; and that on their way to the project site, they were harassed by the herein accused who according to the late Anastacio Macato were men of the Mayor and were trying to prevent him from guiding them (TSN, 3-14-89, p. 10).<br><br>The prosecution likewise presented one Pablo Millano who testified that on April 27, 1988 he overheard the herein accused, who were then having a drinking spree, planning to kill the late Anastacio Macato (TSN, 12-13-88, p. 11).&nbsp; However, the trial court did not give credence to his testimony in view of the inconsistencies therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>Maria Gina Figueroa, the COA audit examiner, also testified that the victim informed her of the names of herein accused and their relationship with the mayor, whose project was the subject of the audit examination and later reported by her to have a disallowance amounting to P1,800,000.00.&nbsp; Her testimony was corroborated by Miguel M. Diaz, a technical audit specialist and member of her audit team.<br><br>Dr. Adoracion L. Cinco, testifying on the results of her post mortem examination of the victim, said that the victim sustained "(o)nly one mortal wound that stab on the (right posterior) chest but the bluish discoloration on every part of the victim(‘s) body and the (cut or broken) molars and upper incisors showed that the victim was molested of (sic) a hard object by his assailant(s)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the court a quo also noted her testimony that said fatal stab wound which entered at the victim’s back and hit the coronary blood vessel leading to the heart was probably administered from behind, and "could not have been inflicted with the victim and his assailant hugging (facing) each other because the victim could have defended himself considering that he has a stout physique x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Finally, it is noted that prosecution eyewitness Lydia M. Zilmar is related to the following accused as follows; (a) Julio Zilmar, by blood, (b) Alfredo Isanan, Jr., the husband of her stepdaughter, and (c) Alfredo Isanan, Sr., her ‘balaye.’<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Scenario of the Defense</u></b></center><br>In contrast to the prosecution’s theory that the seven accused in conspiracy with each other and with treachery and evident premeditation all participated in the killing, the defense claims that it was only Virgilio Obzunar who perpetrated said killing, and then only in self-defense.&nbsp; The defense presented eight witnesses, namely:&nbsp; Ricardo Patrimonio who rebutted the testimony of prosecution witness Pablo Millano by denying having had a drink with the latter; Patrolmen Ananias Idlisan and Edgardo Valdez who corroborated the accused’s denials and alibis; Pedro Aclado who testified seeing the victim smash a bottle of tuba on the head of Virgilio Obzunar; the said accused-appellant Virgilio Obzunar who admitted killing the victim albeit in self-defense; and the three accused-appellants Alfredo Isanan, Sr., Artemio Obzunar, and Julio Zilmar, who all offered alibis.&nbsp; The defense’s version of the facts is follows:<br><blockquote>"In the evening of May 6, 1988, in Talalora, Samar, there were two wakes, one for Agapito Borico, whose house was situated on the corners of Domingo and Bonifacio sts. (sic), and the other wake at located along (sic) Los Martirez St., where there was a wake for the grandchild of Francisca Zilmar.&nbsp; The six appellants, namely, Virgilio Obzunar, Artemio Obzunar, Nelson Isanan, Alfredo Isanan, Jr., Julio Zilmar, and Jose Superio were at the wake of Agapito Borico.&nbsp; The other appellant, Alfredo Isanan, Sr., father of the two other appellants, although he was there earlier that evening, left (for) home after spending few minutes thereat.&nbsp; The six other appellants were playing cards, and joining a drinking spree at the said wake.&nbsp; Found playing mahjong on another table, was Anastacio Macato; he was observed to be happy and jolly, and in fact he was winning his bets.&nbsp; Actually, Virgilio Obzunar was inside another house just immediately in front of the house of Agapito Borico, drinking with Javier Macato, son of Anastacio Macato.&nbsp; Virgilio Obzunar made a joke a ‘balikbayan’, a relative of the dead man, Agapito Borico, which irked Javier Macato.&nbsp; This resulted in a heated altercation between Virgilio Obzunar and Javier Macato.&nbsp; They nearly came to blow and clash.&nbsp; But cooler heads intervened, most specially that two police officers, Pat. Edgardo Valdez and Pat. Ananias Idlisan of the INP Talalora, Samar were there to pacify the two.&nbsp; Both were advised to go home.&nbsp; In the meanwhile (sic), from the mahjong table where he was seated, father Anastacio Macato was observing the incident.&nbsp; After Javier Macato left the place, Virgilio (sic) Obzunar followed, and walked his way home.&nbsp; Not knowing, Anastacio Macato, a known thou (sic) tough character, left the mahjon (sic) table, and walked behind Virgilio Obzunar.&nbsp; After a few meters walk, Virgilio (sic) Obzunar heard a call from behind him, and when he turned his back, he saw Anastacio Macato walking towards him.&nbsp; He faced Anastacio Macato, and when he was in front of him, Virgilio Obzunar admonish (sic) his son, Javier Macato, while he was about to (sic) him (Virgilio Obzunar) at the wake.&nbsp; Without any word, Anastacio obzunar (sic) boxed Virgilio Obzunar straight on the face; and after he was thrown on the ground, Anastacio Macato ran away.&nbsp; After he was able to rise himself up, he looked around, but Anastacio Macato was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; While walking home, he had to pass the house of Francisca Zilmar, where there was another wake for a child.&nbsp; While passing said house, someone called his attention from a group of persons seated on a table drinking tuba.&nbsp; When he approcahed (sic) the table, he saw Anastacio Macato behind another person among the group.&nbsp; When he asked why he (Asnastacio [sic] Macato) boxed him (Virglio [sic] Obzunar), the deceased lifted a half-filled gallong (sic) of tuba, and smashed the same on the face of appellant Virgilio Obzunar.&nbsp; The latter because (sic) groggy and was not in full consciousness after he was thrown aback (sic) against a fence.&nbsp; When he regained conscousness (sic), and found that Anastacio Macato was no longer there; among the persons who were at that wake was Pedro Aclado, a Barangay Tanod who advised said appellant to get medical treatment as the face of Virgilio Obzunar was bloody as a result of that smashing of a gallon by the deceased.&nbsp; Pedro Aclado testified that he accompanied Virgilio Obzunar to the house of the midwife who was the only person available in the municipality to (sic) could extend some medical help.&nbsp; While they were walking along Los Martirez st. in front of the house of Lydia Zilmar, Anastacio Macato accosted Virgilio Macato, and immediately grappled and wrestled with him, and he tried to choke appellant Virgilio Obzunar; the latter tried to free himself from the grip and hold of Anastacio Macato, but the aggression (sic) was bigger in built (sic); he was strangling Virgilio Obzunar.&nbsp; As he was about to lose breath, Virgilio (sic) Obzunar pulled out a small knife from his waist, and stabbed the deceased on his stab (sic).&nbsp; They continue (sic) to struggle and both fell down to the ground.&nbsp; After sensing that Anastacio Macato was already motionless, he stood up, and time later (sic), the two policemen, Pat. Edgardo Vladez (sic) and Pat. Ananias Idlisan arrived at the scene of the incident.&nbsp; These two policemen demdanded (sic) that he throw away his knife, but he did not, because he was afraid some relative of the deceased might come out, especially that it was infront (sic) of the house of Lydia Zilmar, sister of the deceased.&nbsp; He wanted to surrender to the chief of police.&nbsp; Pat. Idlisan went to fetch the chief of police, and when the station commander (arrived), he fired hi (sic) armalite rifle, and Virgilio Obzunar surrenered (sic).&nbsp; He was brought to the INP station, and he was boxed, and that was an entry in the police blotter of the incident, and that he stabbed to death one Anastacio Macato, a Letter Carrier.&nbsp; As he needed immediate medical attendance a midwife on the municipality extended him some first aid assistance, but he was advised to go to Tacloban City to subject (sic) to more thorough medical treatment, as he suffered cuts and wounds on his face.&nbsp; He alone killed Ansatacio (sic) Macato.&nbsp; There were no other persons involved.&nbsp; But when the complaint was filed before the Municipal Trial Court of Talalora, Samar, six other persons were impleaded.&nbsp; He (sic) first even the Regional Trial Court of Bassy (sic), Samar, was in great doubt as to the participation of the other five or six accused considering the wounds which the deceased sustained, and the inconsistent stand of the prosecution as to (who) actually stabbed the deceased.&nbsp; Was it Virgilio Obzunar or Artemio Obzunar?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Trial Court’s Ruling</u></b></center><br>On January 16, 1990, the trial court rendered its decision, the decretal portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing judgement (sic) is hereby rendered, finding accused: ARTEMIO OBZUNAR, VIRGILIO OBZUNAR, NELSON ISANAN, ALFREDO ISANAN, SR., ALFREDO ISANAN, JR., JULIO ZILMAR and JOSE SUPERIO, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; All the accused are sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, and to pay the heirs of the deceased ANASTACIO MACATO, jointly and severally in the amount of THIRTY THOUSAND (P30,000.00) PESOS and to pay also jointly and severally the costs of the suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>On appeal, accused-appellants made the following assignments of errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote>"That the trial court erred in giving due weight and credence to the doubtful, perjured, unreliable and uncorroborated testimonies of the three (3) prosecution witnesses.<br><br>That the trial court erred in holding that conspiracy existed among and between the appellants in killing the victim.<br><br>That the trial court erred in rejecting the claim of appellant Virgilio Obzunar that he killed the deceased in the act of lawful self-defense.<br><br>That the trial court erred in not acquitting the appellants on the ground that their guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt."</blockquote>all of which may be summed up as questioning the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses and its appreciation of the weight and sufficiency of the prosecution’s evidence, vis-à-vis that of the defense.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court‘s Ruling<br>First issue:&nbsp; Credibility of Witnesses</u></b></center><br>In deciding this appeal, the Court reiterates the general rule that --<br><blockquote>"x x x when the question is raised as to whether to believe the version of the prosecution or that of the defense, the trial court’s choice is generally viewed as correct and entitled to the highest respect because it is more competent to conclude so, having had the opportunity to observe the witnesses’ demeanor and deportment on the witness stand, and the manner in which they gave their testimonies, and therefore could better discern if such witnesses were telling the truth; the trial court is thus in the best position to weigh conflicting testimonies.&nbsp; Therefore, unless the trial judge plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, might affect the result of the case, his assessment on credibility must be respected."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>After a thorough review of this case, we find that the trial court did not overlook any such material fact nor did it commit any palpable error in assessing the credibility of the witnesses presented by both sides.&nbsp; It did not err in giving full faith and credit to the narration of Lydia Zilmar as to how her brother was chased and killed by herein accused-appellants, as she was not shown to have any ill motive to testify falsely against the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This is further bolstered by the rule that "the testimony of a witness should normally be accepted especially when the witness is the victim or his near relative because these witnesses usually strive to remember the face(s) of the assailants"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and the truism that "x x x relationship with a victim would deter a witness from indiscriminately implicating anybody to the crime.&nbsp; His natural and usual interest would be to identify the malefactor and secure his conviction to obtain true justice for the death of a relative.&nbsp; This is (e)specially so when the witnesses were present at the scene of the crime x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> as in this case.&nbsp; Moreover, her positive identification of the accused must prevail over their bare denial because "denial, like alibi, is a weak defense which becomes even weaker in the face of the positive identification of the accused by prosecution witnesses.&nbsp; The accused’s denial constituted self-serving negative evidence which can hardly be considered as overcoming a straightforward and credit-worthy eyewitness account."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The salient portions of her testimony are as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><th scope="row" width="9%"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td width="91%"><div align="LEFT">Mrs. Zilmar, you said that you are a resident of Talalora, Samar, for how long have you been a resident of Talalora?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Since birth, fourty (sic)-seven years now.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Up to the present?</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">A</div></th><td><div align="LEFT"> Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT"></div></th><td><div align="LEFT">x x x x x x x x x</div></td></tr><tr><th scope="row"><div align="LEFT">Q</div></th><td><div align="LEFT">Will you kindly tell us?

As astutely observed by the trial court:<br><blockquote>"While it may be true that only Wound no. 2 x x x was a fatal wound caused by a sharp pointed object, which according to Dr. Cinco was inflicted by the assailant while he was at the back of the victim, Wounds Nos. 1,3,4,5 and 6 which are multiple abrasions, lacerated wounds, the cut teeth (upper and lower molars), as well as the several blood clots on the body of the victim, were caused by blunt objects, and clearly indicate that they were not inflicted by only one person, but by several persons."</blockquote>Hence, the community of purpose and common design of the seven accused-assailants is made evident by their having chased down the victim as a group, their having each participated in the physical assault in pursuit of their murderous intent, and finally, their collective effort in hiding their guilt by limiting their attack to only one fatal wound and playing innocent thereafter.&nbsp; Their foregoing conduct during and after the commission of the felony sufficiently proves their conspiracy beyond the scintilla of a doubt.&nbsp; Hence, in the determination of their criminal liability, the rule that the act of one is the act of all applies four-square.<br><br><center><b><u>Third Issue: Alleged&nbsp; Self-Defense</u></b></center><br>The admission by Virgilio Obzunar that he was the one who administered the fatal stab wound albeit in self-defense shifts the burden of proof upon him to show that the killing was justified and that he incurred no criminal liability therefor.&nbsp; As is the rule in such cases, it is incumbent upon the accused to established that all the elements necessary to a claim of self-defense were present, and he can rely only "on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution’s evidence, for, even if the latter were weak, it could not be disbelieved after his open admission of responsibility for the killing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He must prove the essential requisites of self-defense, to wit:&nbsp; (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the aggression, and (c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the accused.<br><br>In the instant case, the claim of self-defense must fail because that most indispensable element of all -- unlawful aggression on the part of the victim -- was not sufficiently proven.&nbsp; The defense anchors their claim of self-defense on their assertion that:<br><blockquote>"Deceased Anastacio Macato was the unlawful aggressor.&nbsp; He was of bigger built than the appellant, Virgilio Obzunar.&nbsp; Previous to the stabbing incident on that same evening of May 6, 1988, appellant Virgilio Obzunar was boxed on the face by the deceased, and then flung with a half-filled gallon of tuba, again on the face.&nbsp; And while said appellant was on his way to seek medical treatment for his wounds, deceased waylaid the said appellant, and they grappled and wrestled, and the deceased tried to choke and strangle appellant Virgilio Obzunar.&nbsp; The latter had no alternative but to pull a small knife which was tucked on his waist, and stab the deceased."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote>In the assessment of such defense theory, the Court is guided by the now-familiar rule that "evidence to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but must be credible in itself -- such as the common experience of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.&nbsp; We have no test of the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation, and experience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Consequently, we hold that the trial court was correct in considering the scenario conjured up by the defense as completely unworthy of belief, being inconsistent with normal human conduct.&nbsp; Even the number and extent of the injuries sustained by the victim are inconsistent with the testimony of Virgilio Obzunar that he inflicted only one stab wound upon the victim with his knife,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and his small statute vis-a-vis the big and robust victim.<br><br>Moreover, appellant Virgilio Obzunar testified that the deceased allegedly smashed a half-full gallon of <i>tuba</i> on his head, knocking him unconscious.&nbsp; If it&nbsp; were true that the deceased really intended to do him in, he would have done so at that point and taken advantage of the fact that Obzunar was then supposedly already unconscious, or at the very least dazed and vulnerable.&nbsp; But contrary to ordinary human experience, instead of finishing off the unconscious Obzunar then and there with the least risk to himself, the deceased allegedly and inexplicably called off his attack, ran away and then decided to lie in wait for Obzunar in the dark (giving the latter time and opportunity to recover his senses and strength!) and then jumped him and tried to strangle and kill him.&nbsp; This storyline is redolent of badly written scripts from third-rate local movie fare, and while it might by some imaginative stretch be deemed "entertaining", it cannot pass for a tenable defense.&nbsp; Besides, it bears repeating that the number and kind of wounds on the decease, plus the fact that said injuries were caused by different types of weapons such as bladed, pointed instruments and blunt objects, all belie appellants’ tale that it was the deceased who started the whole fracas.<br><br>With respect to appellant Virgilio Obzunar’s head injury, which was the only significant wound sustained by him, and which he utilized to prop up his allegation of unlawful aggression by the victim, the court <i>a quo</i> noted that:<br><blockquote>"There was a conflicting version (as to) the wound on the forehead of Virgilio Obzunar.&nbsp; The defense claims in its Exhibits ‘3’ and ‘4’ was caused by a gallon of tuba (flung) by the victim at the wake; while prosecution claims accused Virgilio sustained said injury when he fell down and bumped his head on the fence.&nbsp; Be that as it may, accused himself admitted that he did not sustain said injury at the place of the incident.&nbsp; In People vs. Orongan and Lopez, G.R. No. L-32751, December 21, 1988, the Supreme Court states:<br><br>‘That accused killed in self-defense, or even in incomplete self-defense, is equally of doubtful veracity.&nbsp; Standing alone and without corroboration his version is unconvincing, especially when coupled with the fact that accused, who was a(d)mittedly smaller than victim, sustained no injury at all his body while his opponent suffered several wounds.&nbsp; The onus of proving self-defense is on the accused which he failed to do.’"</blockquote>This claim of self-defense by Virgilio Obzunar is in all likelihood a mere cover-up for Artemio Obzunar and the other appellants, especially since in this case Virgilio can conveniently use his head injury, the cause of which had not been conclusively established, as physical proof of his version.<br><br>In light of all the foregoing, we hold that the claim of self-defense in this case cannot be appreciated in the absence of unlawful aggression by the victim, its primordial element.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center style="font-weight: bold;"><u>Fourth Issue: Was Murder Proven<br>Beyond Reasonable Doubt?</u></center><br>We agree with the trial court that the positive identification by the prosecution’s sole eyewitness Lydia Zilmar of the seven accused-appellant coupled with all the prosecution evidence presented in this case sufficiently established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the latter for the offense charged.&nbsp; On the other hand, their failure to present a credible defense or evidence sufficient to rebut the charge against them bolsters our moral certainty of their guilt.<br><br>In connection with the above, we hold that the defense of alibi proffered by accused-appellants Alfredo Isanan, Sr., Julio Zilmar, and Artemio Obzunar must fail because "well-settled is the rule that greater weight is given to the positive identification of the accused by the prosecution witnesses than the accused’s denial and explanation concerning the commission of the crime.&nbsp; Similarly, it is firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of prosecution witnesses and their clear identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This is further buttressed by considering the fact that, as per their alibi, the place where they allegedly were at the time of the killing was near the scene of the crime, and it was not at all physically impossible for them to have been present at the scene and to have participated in the commission of the felony.<br><br>However, we have to differ with the trial court in its finding of treachery in this case, which finding is not supported by evidence on record.&nbsp; It is an almost immutable rule of evidence that treachery must be proven as clearly as the crime itself, and "absent any particulars as to the manner in which the aggression commenced or how the act which resulted in the death of the victim unfolded, as in this case, treachery cannot be appreciated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The prosecution’s sole eyewitness Lydia Zilmar saw what transpired only from the time the victim was already being chased by the accused-appellants.&nbsp; Hence, not having seen how the assailants commenced the execution of the felony, she gave no testimony as to, and there is no sufficient evidence available to prove conclusively, the use of treachery in the commission thereof.&nbsp; Furthermore, the fact that the victim had opportunity to flee from his attackers (although he was subsequently caught) tends to negate the presence of the qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery.<br><br>Nonetheless, the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength was properly and correctly appreciated by the court a quo as this is plainly evident from the fact that the unarmed victim was set upon by his seven armed attackers, stabbed in the back and boxed, kicked and clubbed into senselessness.&nbsp; The felons were able to commit their dastardly act without the former being able to put up any defense.&nbsp; Thus, even in the absence of treachery, abuse of superior strength would still qualify the killing to murder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance present, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> meted out to accused-appellants stands.<br><br>The amount of P30,000.00 imposed by the trial court as civil indemnity shall be raised to P50,000.00 in accord with prevailing jurisprudence.[30]<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the herein appealed Judgment convicting appellants Artemio Obzunar, Virgilio Obzunar, Nelson Isanan, Alfredo Isanan Sr., Alfredo Isanan Jr., Julio Zilmar and Jose Superio of the crime of murder and imposing on them the penalty of reclusion perpetua is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> subject to the modification that they shall pay jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased Anastacio Macato civil indemnity in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Melo, and Francisco, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp;
