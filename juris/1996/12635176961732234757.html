				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant Rodelio Cruz appeals from a judgment of conviction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> meted out to him by the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal for raping his twelve year old niece, Mary Jane Alonzo.<br>In a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 30, 1991, Mary Jane Alonzo charged accused-appellant with the crime of rape committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 25th day of April, 1991, in the Municipality of Taytay, province of Rizal, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs (sic) and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with a twelve (12) year old girl, Mary Jane Alonzo y Cruz, without her consent and against her will.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>Accused-appellant pleaded "not guilty" to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The evidence for the prosecution shows that accused-appellant is the brother of Mary Jane's mother, Belinda Alonzo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> He lives at the house adjoining the Alonzos' dwelling in Elwood Street, Taytay, Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On April 25, 1991, around three o'clock in the afternoon, Mary Jane was about to take a bath, when accused-appellant entered the bathroom of the Alonzos located at the back of their house. Accused-appellant entered through the side of the bathroom which was covered only by jute sack. Once inside, accused-appellant took off his clothes and forcibly undressed Mary Jane. Mary Jane tried to run but accused-appellant blocked her way and forced her to lie down. Then, he mounted her and tried to have sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> By stroke of fate, Mary Jane's brother, Roberto Alonzo, passed by the bathroom and saw accused-appellant lying on top of her. Accused-appellant saw Roberto hurriedly put on his clothes and rushed to their house. Roberto pursued accused-appellant and challenged him to a fight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Later that night, Roberto revealed the incident to their father, Juanito Alonzo. The following day, April 26, 1991, Juanito accompanied Mary Jane to the police station where she executed a sworn statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Mary Jane alleged in her sworn statement that accused-appellant deflowered her for the first time in 1988 when she was only nine years old. This was followed by several more assaults, the last of which happened on April 25, 1991 when she was already twelve years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The medical examination conducted by Dr. Vlademir Villaseñor, medico-legal officer of the PNP Crime Laboratory, disclosed the presence of deep healed lacerations in Mary Jane's genitalia, showing that she has had sexual experience in the past.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>For his defense, accused-appellant denied forcing any sexual intercourse with Mary Jane on April 25, 1991. He claimed that at the time when the alleged rape was committed, he was at the factory of High Grades Packaging Product located at Libid, Kay Tikling, Taytay, Rizal where he worked as machine operator. He went home at four o'clock in the afternoon. Upon reaching their house, he rested for a few minutes, and then went to the bathroom to freshen himself. Their bathroom is located at the back of their house, beside the bathroom of the Alonzos. While in the bathroom, he heard a rustling sound. He peeped through a hole on the wall to determine its source, and saw Mary Jane bathing at the back of their bathroom. Surprised, he immediately covered the hole and continued to wash himself. Moments later, he heard somebody calling his name. It turned out to be Roberto, Mary Jane's brother, who accused him of peeping at Mary Jane.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The trial court found the accused guilty as charged. Accused was sentenced as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Rodelio Cruz y San Jose GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer and undergo imprisonment of reclusion perpetua, to pay the complaining witness the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs.<br><br>In the service of his sentence he shall be credited with the full benefits of the preventive imprisonment undergone by him, pursuant to Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 6127, if he voluntarily agrees in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>In this appeal, accused-appellant faults the trial court for finding him guilty of the crime of rape and for giving weight and credence to the improbable and inconsistent testimony of Mary Jane.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>We disagree with the trial court's conclusion that accused-appellant is guilty of consummated rape. It appears from the records that accused-appellant did not succeed in having sexual intercourse with Mary Jane on April 25, 1991 because her brother happened to pass by the scene of the crime just when accused-appellant was about to ravish her. Mary Jane admitted on several occasions that accused-appellant was unable to consummate the act of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the earlier part of her direct testimony, Mary Jane gave a detailed account on how accused-appellant violated her:<br><blockquote><center>x x x</center><br><b>PROS.

She testified:<br><br><center>xxx</center><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you(r) brother able to know (sic) about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incident?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because my brother saw what Rodelio Cruz did to me.<br><br><b>Q.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you say that your brother witnessed the said <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incident?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because while we were (witness referring to her and accused <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodelio Cruz) inside the comfort room, my brother passed thru (sic) the comfort room and saw Rodelio lying on top of&nbsp;&nbsp; me. <br><br><b>COURT:</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brother of yours is he older or younger than you?<br><br><b>WITNESS:</b><br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is older, sir.<br><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How old is he?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nineteen (19) years old, sir.<br><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see him peeping when both of you are inside the&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bathroom?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, sir.<br><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you come to know that your brother was peeping?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Rodelio Cruz saw my brother peeping at us and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rodelio Cruz suddenly wear (sic) his clothes and ran to their house and my brother followed him to their house.<br><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When did you(r) brother chase him?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that very day, April 25.<br><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to the rape incident when did your brother <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chase Rodelio?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Rodelio was about to ran to their house my brother <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed suit.<br><br><b>Q:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you mean after the accused had finished what he had done <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to you your brother waited first and gave chase to the accused, is that correct?<br><br><b>A:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am telling this honorable court are those that <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happened during 1988, 1989, 1990.

(emphasis supplied)<br><br><center>x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></center></blockquote>It is clear from Mary Jane's testimony that accused-appellant succeeded in raping her in the past, but not on April 25, 1991. Accused-appellant cannot be convicted for consummated rape on the basis of such evidence as the complaint specifically refers to the offense committed on April 25, 1991. Due process demands that the accused in a criminal case should be informed of the nature of the offense with which he is charged before he is put on trial. To convict him for an offense not alleged in the complaint or information will violate such right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Considering the evidence presented, we find the accused-appellant guilty of attempted rape. Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; By using force or intimidation;<br><br>2.&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>3.&nbsp; When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>In the case at bar, there was no carnal knowledge although accused-appellant has commenced the commission of the offense by overt acts. He surreptitiously entered the bathroom when Mary Jane was about to take a bath. He removed his clothes, afterwhich he started to disrobe Mary Jane. The intention of accused-appellant is obvious. The circumstances show that he had nothing in mind at that time but to satisfy his carnal desire. If it were not for the timely intervention of Mary Jane's brother, accused-appellant would have again consummated his lust against Mary Jane's will.<br><br>IN VIEW WHEREOF, the appealed judgment is <b>MODIFIED.</b> Accused-appellant Rodelio Cruz y San Jose is hereby declared <b>GUILTY</b> of <b>ATTEMPTED RAPE.</b> He is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) years of prision correccional as minimum to ten (10) years of prision mayor as maximum and to pay the offended party the sum of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Regalado (Chairman), Romero, Mendoza, and Torres, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%">[1]</sup> Decision penned by Judge Felix S.
